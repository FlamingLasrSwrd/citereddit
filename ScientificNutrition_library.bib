Patients in control group were treated with regular therapy using the Western medicine and drugs, while those in observation group, based on the treatment in control group, were treated with berberine. Changes in relevant indexes to blood glucose and lipid metabolisms and inflammatory factors were compared between the two groups.

At 1 month after treatment, levels of fasting blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose, insulin resistance index and blood lipid indexes in both groups were lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P{\textless}0.05). At 1 month after treatment, levels of fasting blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose, insulin resistance index and blood lipid indexes in observation group were significantly lower than those in control group during the same period (P{\textless}0.05). Moreover, levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in both groups at 1 month after treatment were lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P{\textless}0.05), and they were lower in observation group at 1 month after treatment than those in control group during the same period (P{\textless}0.05). Finally, hs-CRP was positively correlated with fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol and triglyceride. The combined application of berberine in patients with metabolic syndrome can effectively regulate blood glucose and blood lipid of patients, alleviate insulin resistance and reduce the level of inflammatory response in the body.},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a usual (UP) versus a high protein (HP) diet on muscle function, cognitive function, quality of life and biochemical regulators of protein metabolism.
DESIGN: A randomised intervention study was conducted with 23 healthy males (aged 19-31 yrs). All subjects consumed a Usual Protein (UP) diet (1.5 g protein/kg BW) for a 1-wk run-in period before the intervention period where they were assigned to either a UP or a High Protein (HP) diet (3.0 g protein/kg BW) for 3-wks with controlled intake of food and beverages. Blood and urine samples were taken along with measurements of physiological functions at baseline and at the end of the intervention period.
RESULTS: The HP group improved their reaction time significantly compared with the UP group. Branched chain amino acids and phenylalanine in plasma were significantly increased following the HP diet, which may explain the improved reaction time.
CONCLUSION: Healthy young males fed a HP diet improved reaction time. No adverse effects of the HP diet were observed. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00621231.},

	abstract = {Background
Eight weeks of a high protein diet ({\textgreater}3 g/kg/day) coupled with a periodized heavy resistance training program has been shown to positively affect body composition with no deleterious effects on health. Using a randomized, crossover design, resistance-trained male subjects underwent a 16-week intervention (i.e., two 8-week periods) in which they consumed either their normal (i.e., habitual) or a higher protein diet ({\textgreater}3 g/kg/day). Thus, the purpose of this study was to ascertain if significantly increasing protein intake would affect clinical markers of health (i.e., lipids, kidney function, etc.) as well as performance and body composition in young males with extensive resistance training experience.

Methods
Twelve healthy resistance-trained men volunteered for this study (mean ± SD: age 25.9 ± 3.7 years; height 178.0 ± 8.5 cm; years of resistance training experience 7.6 ± 3.6) with 11 subjects completing most of the assessments. In a randomized crossover trial, subjects were tested at baseline and after two 8-week treatment periods (i.e., habitual [normal] diet and high protein diet) for body composition, measures of health (i.e., blood lipids, comprehensive metabolic panel) and performance. Each subject maintained a food diary for the 16-week treatment period (i.e., 8 weeks on their normal or habitual diet and 8 weeks on a high protein diet). Each subject provided a food diary of two weekdays and one weekend day per week. In addition, subjects kept a diary of their training regimen that was used to calculate total work performed.

Results
During the normal and high protein phase of the treatment period, subjects consumed 2.6 ± 0.8 and 3.3 ± 0.8 g/kg/day of dietary protein, respectively. The mean protein intake over the 4-month period was 2.9 ± 0.9 g/kg/day. The high protein group consumed significantly more calories and protein (p {\textless} 0.05) than the normal protein group. There were no differences in dietary intake between the groups for any other measure. Moreover, there were no significant changes in body composition or markers of health in either group. There were no side effects (i.e., blood lipids, glucose, renal, kidney function etc.) regarding high protein consumption.

Conclusion
In resistance-trained young men who do not significantly alter their training regimen, consuming a high protein diet (2.6 to 3.3 g/kg/day) over a 4-month period has no effect on blood lipids or markers of renal and hepatic function. Nor were there any changes in performance or body composition. This is the first crossover trial using resistance-trained subjects in which the elevation of protein intake to over four times the recommended dietary allowance has shown no harmful effects.},

	abstract = {Context
The role of diet composition in response to overeating and energy dissipation in humans is unclear.

Objective
To evaluate the effects of overconsumption of low, normal, and high protein diets on weight gain, energy expenditure, and body composition.

Design, Setting, and Participants
A single-blind, randomized controlled trial of 25 US healthy, weight-stable male and female volunteers, aged 18 to 35 years with a body mass index between 19 and 30. The first participant was admitted to the inpatient metabolic unit in June 2005 and the last in October 2007.

Intervention
After consuming a weight-stabilizing diet for 13 to 25 days, participants were randomized to diets containing 5\% of energy from protein (low protein), 15\% (normal protein), or 25\% (high protein), which they were overfed during the last 8 weeks of their 10- to 12-week stay in the inpatient metabolic unit. Compared with energy intake during the weight stabilization period, the protein diets provided approximately 40\% more energy intake, which corresponds to 954 kcal/d (95\% CI, 884–1022 kcal/d).

Main Outcome Measures
Body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry biweekly, resting energy expenditure was measured weekly by ventilated hood, and total energy expenditure by doubly labeled water prior to the overeating and weight stabilization periods and at weeks 7 to 8.

Results
Overeating produced significantly less weight gain in the low protein diet group (3.16 kg; 95\% CI, 1.88–4.44 kg) compared with the normal protein diet group (6.05 kg; 95\% CI, 4.84–7.26 kg) or the high protein diet group (6.51 kg; 95\% CI, 5.23–7.79 kg) (P=.002). Body fat increased similarly in all 3 protein diet groups and represented 50\% to more than 90\% of the excess stored calories. Resting energy expenditure, total energy expenditure, and body protein did not increase during overfeeding with the low protein diet. In contrast, resting energy expenditure (normal protein diet: 160 kcal/d [95\% CI, 102–218 kcal/d]; high protein diet: 227 kcal/d [95\% CI, 165–289 kcal/d]) and body protein (lean body mass) (normal protein diet: 2.87 kg [95\% CI, 2.11–3.62 kg]; high protein diet: 3.18 kg [95\% CI, 2.37–3.98 kg]) increased significantly with the normal and high protein diets.

Conclusions
Among persons living in a controlled setting, calories alone account for the increase in fat; protein affected energy expenditure and storage of lean body mass, but not body fat storage.},

	abstract = {Objective We performed a systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression to determine if dietary protein supplementation augments resistance exercise training (RET)-induced gains in muscle mass and strength.
Data sources A systematic search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL and SportDiscus.
Eligibility criteria Only randomised controlled trials with RET ≥6 weeks in duration and dietary protein supplementation.
Design Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions with four a priori determined covariates. Two-phase break point analysis was used to determine the relationship between total protein intake and changes in fat-free mass (FFM).
Results Data from 49 studies with 1863 participants showed that dietary protein supplementation significantly (all p{\textless}0.05) increased changes (means (95\% CI)) in: strength—one-repetition-maximum (2.49 kg (0.64, 4.33)), FFM (0.30 kg (0.09, 0.52)) and muscle size—muscle fibre cross-sectional area (CSA; 310 µm2 (51, 570)) and mid-femur CSA (7.2 mm2 (0.20, 14.30)) during periods of prolonged RET. The impact of protein supplementation on gains in FFM was reduced with increasing age (−0.01 kg (−0.02,–0.00), p=0.002) and was more effective in resistance-trained individuals (0.75 kg (0.09, 1.40), p=0.03). Protein supplementation beyond total protein intakes of 1.62 g/kg/day resulted in no further RET-induced gains in FFM.
Summary/conclusion Dietary protein supplementation significantly enhanced changes in muscle strength and size during prolonged RET in healthy adults. Increasing age reduces and training experience increases the efficacy of protein supplementation during RET. With protein supplementation, protein intakes at amounts greater than {\textasciitilde}1.6 g/kg/day do not further contribute RET-induced gains in FFM.},

	abstract = {The debate on meat's role in health and disease is a rowdy and dissonant one. This study uses the health section of the online version of The Daily Mail as a case study to carry out a quantitative and qualitative reflection on the related discourses in mass media during the first fifteen years of the 21st century. This period ranged from the fall-out of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis and its associated food safety anxieties, over the Atkins diet-craze in 2003 and the avian flu episode in 2007, to the highly influential publication of the report on colon cancer by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2015. A variety of conflicting news items was discernible, whereby moments of crisis, depicting the potential hazards of meat eating, seemed to generate reassuring counter-reactions stressing the benefits of meat as a rich source of nutrients. In contrast, when the popularity of meat-rich diets was on the rise due to diets stressing the role of protein in weight control, several warnings were issued. Meat's long-standing and semiotic connotations of vitality, strength, and fertility were either confirmed, rejected or inverted. Often this was achieved through scientification or medicalisation, with references to nutritional studies. The holistic role of meat within human diets and health was thus mostly reduced to a focus on specific food components and isolated biological mechanisms. The narratives were often histrionic and displayed serious contradictions. Since several interests were at play, involving a variety of input from dieticians, (health) authorities, the food industry, vegan or vegetarian movements, and celebrities, the overall discourse was highly heterogeneous.},

	abstract = {Almost exactly 100years ago Osborne and colleagues demonstrated that restricting the food intake of a small number of female rats extended their lifespan. In the 1930s experiments on the impact of diet on lifespan were extended by Slonaker, and subsequently McCay. Slonaker concluded that there was a strong impact of protein intake on lifespan, while McCay concluded that calories are the main factor causing differences in lifespan when animals are restricted (Calorie restriction or CR). Hence from the very beginning the question of whether food restriction acts on lifespan via reduced calorie intake or reduced protein intake was disputed. Subsequent work supported the idea that calories were the dominant factor. More recently, however, this role has again been questioned, particularly in studies of insects. Here we review the data regarding previous studies of protein and calorie restriction in rodents. We show that increasing CR (with simultaneous protein restriction: PR) increases lifespan, and that CR with no PR generates an identical effect. None of the residual variation in the impact of CR (with PR) on lifespan could be traced to variation in macronutrient content of the diet. Other studies show that low protein content in the diet does increase median lifespan, but the effect is smaller than the CR effect. We conclude that CR is a valid phenomenon in rodents that cannot be explained by changes in protein intake, but that there is a separate phenomenon linking protein intake to lifespan, which acts over a different range of protein intakes than is typical in CR studies. This suggests there may be a fundamental difference in the responses of insects and rodents to CR. This may be traced to differences in the physiology of these groups, or reflect a major methodological difference between ‘restriction’ studies performed on rodents and insects. We suggest that studies where the diet is supplied ad libitum, but diluted with inert components, should perhaps be called dietary or caloric dilution, rather than dietary or caloric restriction, to distinguish these potentially important methodological differences.},

Calorie restriction (CR) decreases serum IGF-1 concentration by {\textasciitilde}40\%, protects against cancer and slows aging in rodents. However, the long-term effects of CR with adequate nutrition on circulating IGF-1 levels in humans are unknown. Here we report data from two long-term CR studies (1 and 6 years) showing that severe CR without malnutrition did not change IGF-1 and IGF-1 : IGFBP-3 ratio levels in humans. In contrast, total and free IGF-1 concentrations were significantly lower in moderately protein-restricted individuals. Reducing protein intake from an average of 1.67 g kg −1 of body weight per day to 0.95 g kg −1 of body weight per day for 3 weeks in six volunteers practicing CR resulted in a reduction in serum IGF-1 from 194 ng mL −1 to 152 ng mL −1 . These findings demonstrate that, unlike in rodents, long-term severe CR does not reduce serum IGF-1 concentration and IGF-1 : IGFBP-3 ratio in humans. In addition, our data provide evidence that protein intake is a key determinant of circulating IGF-1 levels in humans, and suggest that reduced protein intake may become an important component of anticancer and anti-aging dietary interventions.},

	abstract = {The lower rates of some cancers in Asian countries than in Western countries may be partly because of diet, although the mechanisms are unknown. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether a plant-based (vegan) diet is associated with a lower circulating level of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) compared with a meat-eating or lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet among 292 British women, ages 20–70 years. The mean serum IGF-I concentration was 13\% lower in 92 vegan women compared with 99 meat-eaters and 101 vegetarians (P = 0.0006). The mean concentrations of both serum IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-1 and IGFBP-2 were 20–40\% higher in vegan women compared with meat-eaters and vegetarians (P = 0.005 and P = 0.0008 for IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2, respectively). There were no significant differences in IGFBP-3, C-peptide, or sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations between the diet groups. Intake of protein rich in essential amino acids was positively associated with serum IGF-I (Pearson partial correlation coefficient; r = 0.27; P {\textless} 0.0001) and explained most of the differences in IGF-I concentration between the diet groups. These data suggest that a plant-based diet is associated with lower circulating levels of total IGF-I and higher levels of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2.},

	abstract = {DR (dietary restriction), or reduced food intake without malnutrition, is associated with extended longevity, improved metabolic fitness and increased stress resistance in a wide range of organisms. DR is often referred to as calorie restriction, implying that reduced energy intake is responsible for its widespread and evolutionarily conserved benefits. However, recent data indicate dietary amino acid restriction as a key mediator of DR benefits. In fruitflies, an imbalance in essential amino acid intake is thought to underlie longevity benefits of DR. In mammals, reduced dietary protein or essential amino acid intake can extend longevity, improve metabolic fitness and increase stress resistance. In the present paper we review two evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathways responsible for sensing amino acid levels. The eIF2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2α) kinase GCN2 (general amino acid control non-derepressible 2) senses the absence of one or more amino acids by virtue of direct binding to uncharged cognate tRNAs. The presence of certain amino acids, such as leucine, permits activation of the master growth regulating kinase TOR (target of rapamycin). These two signal transduction pathways react to amino acid deprivation by inhibiting general protein translation while at the same time increasing translation of specific mRNAs involved in restoring homoeostasis. Together, these pathways may contribute to the regulation of longevity, metabolic fitness and stress resistance.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological evidence points to increased dairy and meat consumption, staples of the Western diet, as major risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). This paper presents a new concept and comprehensive review of leucine-mediated cell signaling explaining the pathogenesis of T2D and obesity by leucine-induced over-stimulation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1, a pivotal nutrient-sensitive kinase, promotes growth and cell proliferation in response to glucose, energy, growth factors and amino acids. Dairy proteins and meat stimulate insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling and provide high amounts of leucine, a primary and independent stimulator for mTORC1 activation. The downstream target of mTORC1, the kinase S6K1, induces insulin resistance by phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, thereby increasing the metabolic burden of β-cells. Moreover, leucine-mediated mTORC1-S6K1-signaling plays an important role in adipogenesis, thus increasing the risk of obesity-mediated insulin resistance. High consumption of leucine-rich proteins explains exaggerated mTORC1-dependent insulin secretion, increased β-cell growth and β-cell proliferation promoting an early onset of replicative β-cell senescence with subsequent β-cell apoptosis. Disturbances of β-cell mass regulation with increased β-cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as insulin resistance are hallmarks of T2D, which are all associated with hyperactivation of mTORC1. In contrast, the anti-diabetic drug metformin antagonizes leucine-mediated mTORC1 signaling. Plant-derived polyphenols and flavonoids are identified as natural inhibitors of mTORC1 and exert anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects. Furthermore, bariatric surgery in obesity reduces increased plasma levels of leucine and other branched-chain amino acids. Attenuation of leucine-mediated mTORC1 signaling by defining appropriate upper limits of the daily intake of leucine-rich animal and dairy proteins may offer a great chance for the prevention of T2D and obesity, as well as other epidemic diseases of civilization with increased mTORC1 signaling, especially cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, which are frequently associated with T2D.},

	abstract = {Objective
To investigate the relationship between plasma levels of small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (sdLDL-C) and risk for incident coronary heart disease (CHD) in a prospective study among Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study participants.

Approach and Results
Plasma sdLDL-C was measured in 11,419 men and women of the biracial ARIC study using a newly developed homogeneous assay. A proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between sdLDL-C, vascular risk factors, and risk for CHD events (n=1,158) over a period of ≈11 years. Plasma sdLDL-C levels were strongly correlated with an atherogenic lipid profile and were higher in diabetics than nondiabetics (49.6 vs. 42.3 mg/dL, p{\textless}0.0001). In a model that included established risk factors, sdLDL-C was associated with incident CHD with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.51 (95\%CI: 1.21–1.88) for the highest versus the lowest quartile, respectively. Even in individuals considered to be at low cardiovascular risk based on their LDL-C levels, sdLDL-C predicted risk for incident CHD (HR 1.61; 95\% CI 1.04–2.49). Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants in 8 loci associated with sdLDL-C levels. These loci were in or close to genes previously associated with risk for CHD. We discovered 1 novel locus, PCSK7, for which genetic variation was significantly associated with sdLDL-C and other lipid factors.

Conclusions
sdLDL-C was associated with incident CHD in ARIC study participants. The novel association of genetic variants in PCSK7 with sdLDL-C and other lipid traits may provide new insights into the role of this gene in lipid metabolism.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies showing that smaller low-density lipoprotein (LDL) size is associated with greater atherosclerotic risk did not adequately control for small and large LDL particle correlation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the association of lipoproteins measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in apparently healthy individuals (N = 5538, 38\% White, 28\% African American, 22\% Hispanic, 12\% Chinese). Small and large LDL particle concentrations (LDL-p) were inversely correlated (r = /-0.63, P {\textless} 0.0001). Controlling for risk factors but not for LDL subclass correlation, LDL size and small LDL-p separately were associated with IMT (-20.9 and 31.7 microm change in IMT per 1-S.D., respectively, both P {\textless} 0.001), but large LDL-p was not (4.9 microm, P = 0.27). When LDL subclasses were included in the same model, large and small LDL-p were both associated with IMT (36.6 and 52.2 microm higher IMT per 1-S.D., respectively, both P {\textless} 0.001; 17.7 and 11.6 microm per 100 nmol/L, respectively). LDL size was not significant after accounting for LDL subclasses and risk factors (P = 0.10).
CONCLUSION: Both LDL subclasses were significantly associated with subclinical atherosclerosis, with small LDL confounding the association of large LDL with atherosclerosis. Future studies of LDL size should account for the strong inverse correlation of LDL subclasses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measures of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) subfractions have been proposed as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
PURPOSE: To review published studies that reported relationships between LDL subfractions and cardiovascular outcomes.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1950 to 5 January 2009), CAB Abstracts (1973 to 30 June 2008), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2nd quarter of 2008), limited to English-language studies.
STUDY SELECTION: 3 reviewers selected longitudinal studies with 10 or more participants that reported an association between LDL subfractions and incidence or severity of cardiovascular disease and in which plasma samples were collected before outcome determination.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted from 24 studies. The 10 studies that used analytical methods available for clinical use (all of which used nuclear magnetic resonance) had full data extraction, including quality assessment (good, fair, or poor). All studies were extracted by 1 researcher and verified by another.
DATA SYNTHESIS: All 24 studies, and the subset of 10 nuclear magnetic resonance studies, were heterogeneous in terms of the specific tests analyzed, analytical methods used, participants investigated, and outcomes measured. Higher LDL particle number was consistently associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, independent of other lipid measurements. Other LDL subfractions were generally not associated with cardiovascular disease after adjustment for cholesterol concentrations. No study evaluated the incremental value of LDL subfractions beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors or their test performance.
LIMITATION: Publication bias was a possibility.
CONCLUSION: Higher LDL particle number has been associated with cardiovascular disease incidence, but studies have not determined whether any measures of LDL subfractions add incremental benefit to traditional risk factor assessment. Routine use of clinically available LDL subfraction tests to estimate cardiovascular disease risk is premature.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this meta-analysis was to summarize the evidence related to the association of dietary saturated fat with risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD; CHD inclusive of stroke) in prospective epidemiologic studies.
DESIGN: Twenty-one studies identified by searching MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and secondary referencing qualified for inclusion in this study. A random-effects model was used to derive composite relative risk estimates for CHD, stroke, and CVD.
RESULTS: During 5-23 y of follow-up of 347,747 subjects, 11,006 developed CHD or stroke. Intake of saturated fat was not associated with an increased risk of CHD, stroke, or CVD. The pooled relative risk estimates that compared extreme quantiles of saturated fat intake were 1.07 (95\% CI: 0.96, 1.19; P = 0.22) for CHD, 0.81 (95\% CI: 0.62, 1.05; P = 0.11) for stroke, and 1.00 (95\% CI: 0.89, 1.11; P = 0.95) for CVD. Consideration of age, sex, and study quality did not change the results.
CONCLUSIONS: A meta-analysis of prospective epidemiologic studies showed that there is no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of CHD or CVD. More data are needed to elucidate whether CVD risks are likely to be influenced by the specific nutrients used to replace saturated fat.},

Background Absence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) is traditionally considered low risk for atherosclerosis; however, individuals without CVRFs, as currently defined, still have events.
Objectives This study sought to identify predictors of subclinical atherosclerosis in CVRF-free individuals.
Methods Participants from the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study (n = 4,184) without conventional CVRFs were evaluated (n = 1,779; 45.0 ± 4.1 years, 50.3\% women). CVRF freedom was defined as no current smoking and untreated blood pressure {\textless}140/90 mm Hg, fasting glucose {\textless}126 mg/dl, total cholesterol {\textless}240 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) {\textless}160 mg/dl, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥40 mg/dl. A subgroup with optimal CVRFs (n = 740) was also defined as having blood pressure {\textless}120/80 mm Hg, fasting glucose {\textless}100 mg/dl, glycosylated hemoglobin {\textless}5.7\%, and total cholesterol {\textless}200 mg/dl. We evaluated ultrasound-detected carotid, iliofemoral, and abdominal aortic plaques; coronary artery calcification; serum biomarkers; and lifestyle. Adjusted odds ratios (with 95\% confidence interval) and ordinal logistic regression models were used.
Results Subclinical atherosclerosis (plaque or coronary artery calcification) was present in 49.7\% of CVRF-free participants. Together with male sex and age, LDL-C was independently associated with atherosclerosis presence and extent, in both the CVRF-free and CVRF-optimal groups (odds ratio [×10 mg/dl]: 1.14 to 1.18; p {\textless} 0.01 for all). Atherosclerosis presence and extent was also associated in the CVRF-free group with glycosylated hemoglobin levels.
Conclusions Many CVRF-free middle-aged individuals have atherosclerosis. LDL-C, even at levels currently considered normal, is independently associated with the presence and extent of early systemic atherosclerosis in the absence of major CVRFs. These findings support more effective LDL-C lowering for primordial prevention, even in individuals conventionally considered at optimal risk.

We estimated the proportion of American adults with optimal cardiometabolic health, using different guidelines.Methods: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009–2016 were analyzed (n = 8721). Using the most recent guidelines, metabolic health was defined as having optimal levels of waist circumference (WC {\textless}102/88 cm for men/women), glucose (fasting glucose {\textless}100 mg/dL and hemoglobin A1c {\textless}5.7\%), blood pressure (systolic {\textless}120 and diastolic {\textless}80 mmHg), triglycerides ({\textless}150 mg/dL), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (≥40/50 mg/dL for men/women), and not taking any related medication.Results: Changing from ATP III (Adult Treatment Panel III) guidelines to more recent cut points decreased the proportion of metabolically healthy Americans from 19.9\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 18.3–21.5) to 12.2\% (95\% CI: 10.9–13.6). Dropping WC from the definition increased the percentage of adults with optimal metabolic health to 17.6\%. Characteristics associated with greater prevalence of metabolic health were female gender, youth, more education, never smoking, practicing vigorous physical activity, and low body mass index. Less than one-third of normal weight adults were metabolically healthy and the prevalence decreased to 8.0\% and 0.5\% in overweight and obese individuals, respectively.Conclusions: Prevalence of metabolic health in American adults is alarmingly low, even in normal weight individuals. The large number of people not achieving optimal levels of risk factors, even in low-risk groups, has serious implications for public health.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review
This review captures the existence, cause, and treatment challenges of residual cardiovascular risk (CVR) after aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction.

Recent findings
Scientific evidence implicates low high-density lipoproteins cholesterol (HDL-C) and high triglycerides (TG) in the CVR observed after LDL-C lowering. However, the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) lipid trial with fenofibrate, the Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events (ILLUMINATE) study with torcetrapib, and the recently terminated Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL Cholesterol/High Triglyceride and Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) study with niacin, do not clearly attribute risk reduction value to HDL-C/TG modulation.

Summary
The optimum approach to long-term lipid-modifying therapies for CVR reduction remains uncertain. Consequently, absolute risk modulation via lifestyle changes remains the centerpiece of a strategy addressing the physiological drivers of CVR associated with HDL-C/TG, especially in the context of diabetes/metabolic syndrome.},

Background Compared with traditional risk factors, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores improve prognostic accuracy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes. However, the relative impact of statins on ASCVD outcomes stratified by CAC scores is unknown.
Objectives The authors sought to determine whether CAC can identify patients most likely to benefit from statin treatment.
Methods The authors identified consecutive subjects without pre-existing ASCVD or malignancy who underwent CAC scoring from 2002 to 2009 at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The primary outcome was first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), a composite of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. The effect of statin therapy on outcomes was analyzed stratified by CAC presence and severity, after adjusting for baseline comorbidities with inverse probability of treatment weights based on propensity scores.
Results A total of 13,644 patients (mean age 50 years; 71\% men) were followed for a median of 9.4 years. Comparing patients with and without statin exposure, statin therapy was associated with reduced risk of MACE in patients with CAC (adjusted subhazard ratio: 0.76, 95\% confidence interval: 0.60 to 0.95; p = 0.015), but not in patients without CAC (adjusted subhazard ratio: 1.00, 95\% confidence interval: 0.79 to 1.27; p = 0.99). The effect of statin use on MACE was significantly related to the severity of CAC (p {\textless} 0.0001 for interaction), with the number needed to treat to prevent 1 initial MACE outcome over 10 years ranging from 100 (CAC 1 to 100) to 12 (CAC {\textgreater}100).
Conclusions In a largescale cohort without baseline ASCVD, the presence and severity of CAC identified patients most likely to benefit from statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.},

However, findings for younger people are limited, and the value of detecting and treating hypercholesterolemia in younger adults is debated.ObjectiveTo evaluate the long-term impact of unfavorable serum cholesterol levels on risk of death from CHD, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all causes.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThree prospective studies, from which were selected 3 cohorts of younger men with baseline serum cholesterol level measurements and no history of diabetes mellitus or myocardial infarction. A total of 11,017 men aged 18 through 39 years screened in 1967-1973 for the Chicago Heart Association Detection Project in Industry (CHA); 1266 men aged 25 through 39 years examined in 1959-1963 in the Peoples Gas Company Study (PG); and 69,205 men aged 35 through 39 years screened in 1973-1975 for the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT).Main Outcome MeasuresCause-specific mortality during 25 (CHA), 34 (PG), and 16 (MRFIT) years of follow-up; mortality risks; and estimated life expectancy in relation to baseline serum cholesterol levels.ResultsDeath due to CHD accounted for 26\%, 34\%, and 28\% of all deaths in the CHA, PG, and MRFIT cohorts, respectively; and CVD death for 34\%, 42\%, and 39\% of deaths in the same cohorts, respectively. Men in all 3 cohorts with unfavorable serum cholesterol levels (200-239 mg/dL [5.17-6.18 mmol/L] and ≥240 mg/dL [≥6.21 mmol/L]) had strong gradients of relative mortality risk. For men with serum cholesterol levels of 240 mg/dL or greater (≥6.21 mmol/L) vs favorable levels (\&lt;200 mg/dL [\&lt;5.17 mmol/L]), CHD mortality risk was 2.15 to 3.63 times greater; CVD disease mortality risk was 2.10 to 2.87 times greater; and all-cause mortality was 1.31 to1.49 times greater. Hypercholesterolemic men had age-adjusted absolute risk of CHD death of 59 per 1000 men in 25 years (CHA cohort), 90 per 1000 men in 34 years (PG cohort), and 15 per 1000 men in 16 years (MRFIT cohort). Absolute excess risk was 43.6 per 1000 men (CHA), 81.4 per 1000 men (PG), and 12.1 per 1000 men (MRFIT). Men with favorable baseline serum cholesterol levels had an estimated greater life expectancy of 3.8 to 8.7 years.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate a continuous, graded relationship of serum cholesterol level to long-term risk of CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality, substantial absolute risk and absolute excess risk of CHD and CVD death for younger men with elevated serum cholesterol levels, and longer estimated life expectancy for younger men with favorable serum cholesterol levels.},

PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy and safety of PCSK9 antibodies in adults with hypercholesterolemia.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar; conference proceedings; and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry through 4 April 2015.
STUDY SELECTION: Phase 2 or 3 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment using PCSK9 antibodies with no anti-PCSK9 therapy in adults with hypercholesterolemia.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently extracted data on study characteristics and lipid and clinical outcomes, and rated risk of bias of trials. Prespecified primary end points were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-four RCTs comprising 10 159 patients were included. Compared with no antibody, treatment with PCSK9 antibodies led to marked reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (mean difference, -47.49\% [95\% CI, -69.64\% to -25.35\%]; P {\textless} 0.001] and other atherogenic lipid fractions, and it reduced all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.45 [CI, 0.23 to 0.86]; P = 0.015; heterogeneity P = 0.63; I2 = 0\%) and cardiovascular mortality (OR, 0.50 [CI, 0.23 to 1.10]; P = 0.084; heterogeneity P = 0.78; I2 = 0\%). The rate of myocardial infarction was significantly reduced with use of PCSK9 antibodies (OR, 0.49 [CI, 0.26 to 0.93]; P = 0.030; heterogeneity P = 0.45; I2 = 0\%), and increases in the serum creatine kinase level were reduced (OR, 0.72 [CI, 0.54 to 0.96]; P = 0.026; heterogeneity P = 0.65; I2 = 0\%). Serious adverse events did not increase with administration of PCSK9 antibodies.
LIMITATION: Results were derived from study-level data rather than patient-level data, and clinical outcome data are rare.
CONCLUSION: PCSK9 antibodies seem to be safe and effective for adults with dyslipidemia.

Here, we review recent Mendelian randomization studies evaluating the effect of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).
RECENT FINDINGS: Mendelian randomization studies consistently demonstrate that LDL-C is causally associated with the risk of CHD. Furthermore, exposure to genetically mediated lower LDL-C appears to be associated with a much greater than expected reduction in CHD risk, thus suggesting that LDL-C has a cumulative effect on the risk of CHD. In addition, genetically mediated lower LDL-C is log-linearly associated with the risk of CHD and the effect of polymorphisms in multiple different genes on the risk of CHD is remarkably consistent when measured per unit lower LDL-C.
SUMMARY: The naturally randomized genetic evidence suggests that LDL-C has a causal and cumulative effect on the risk of CHD, and that the clinical benefit of exposure to lower LDL-C is determined by the absolute magnitude of exposure to lower LDL-C independent of the mechanism by which LDL-C is lowered.},

Statins inhibit the synthesis of vitamin K2, the cofactor for matrix Gla-protein activation, which in turn protects arteries from calcification. Statins inhibit the biosynthesis of selenium containing proteins, one of which is glutathione peroxidase serving to suppress peroxidative stress. An impairment of selenoprotein biosynthesis may be a factor in congestive heart failure, reminiscent of the dilated cardiomyopathies seen with selenium deficiency. Thus, the epidemic of heart failure and atherosclerosis that plagues the modern world may paradoxically be aggravated by the pervasive use of statin drugs.

	abstract = {Background
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). We recently reported that glycemic control in patients with T2D can be significantly improved through a continuous care intervention (CCI) including nutritional ketosis. The purpose of this study was to examine CVD risk factors in this cohort.

Methods
We investigated CVD risk factors in patients with T2D who participated in a 1 year open label, non-randomized, controlled study. The CCI group (n = 262) received treatment from a health coach and medical provider. A usual care (UC) group (n = 87) was independently recruited to track customary T2D progression. Circulating biomarkers of cholesterol metabolism and inflammation, blood pressure (BP), carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), multi-factorial risk scores and medication use were examined. A significance level of P {\textless} 0.0019 ensured two-tailed significance at the 5\% level when Bonferroni adjusted for multiple comparisons.

Results
The CCI group consisted of 262 participants (baseline mean (SD): age 54 (8) year, BMI 40.4 (8.8) kg m−2). Intention-to-treat analysis (\% change) revealed the following at 1-year: total LDL-particles (LDL-P) (− 4.9\%, P = 0.02), small LDL-P (− 20.8\%, P = 1.2 × 10−12), LDL-P size (+ 1.1\%, P = 6.0 × 10−10), ApoB (− 1.6\%, P = 0.37), ApoA1 (+ 9.8\%, P {\textless} 10−16), ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (− 9.5\%, P = 1.9 × 10−7), triglyceride/HDL-C ratio (− 29.1\%, P {\textless} 10−16), large VLDL-P (− 38.9\%, P = 4.2 × 10−15), and LDL-C (+ 9.9\%, P = 4.9 × 10−5). Additional effects were reductions in blood pressure, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and white blood cell count (all P {\textless} 1 × 10−7) while cIMT was unchanged. The 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score decreased − 11.9\% (P = 4.9 × 10−5). Antihypertensive medication use was discontinued in 11.4\% of CCI participants (P = 5.3 × 10−5). The UC group of 87 participants [baseline mean (SD): age 52 (10) year, BMI 36.7 (7.2) kg m−2] showed no significant changes. After adjusting for baseline differences when comparing CCI and UC groups, significant improvements for the CCI group included small LDL-P, ApoA1, triglyceride/HDL-C ratio, HDL-C, hsCRP, and LP-IR score in addition to other biomarkers that were previously reported. The CCI group showed a greater rise in LDL-C.

Conclusions
A continuous care treatment including nutritional ketosis in patients with T2D improved most biomarkers of CVD risk after 1 year. The increase in LDL-cholesterol appeared limited to the large LDL subfraction. LDL particle size increased, total LDL-P and ApoB were unchanged, and inflammation and blood pressure decreased., Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02519309. Registered 10 August 2015

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine whether elevated serum cholesterol level is associated with all-cause mortality, mortality from coronary heart disease, or hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina in persons older than 70 years. Also, to evaluate the association between low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and elevated ratio of serum cholesterol to HDL-C with these outcomes.
DESIGN: Prospective, community-based cohort study with yearly interviews.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 997 subjects who were interviewed in 1988 as part of the New Haven, Conn, cohort of the Established Population for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE) and consented to have blood drawn.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The risk factor-adjusted odds ratios of the 4-year incidence of all-cause mortality, mortality from coronary heart disease, and hospitalization for myocardial infarction or unstable angina were calculated for the following: subjects with total serum cholesterol levels greater than or equal to 6.20 mmol/L ({\textgreater} or = 240 mg/dL) compared with subjects with cholesterol levels less than 5.20 mmol/L ({\textless} 200 mg/dL); subjects in the lowest tertile of HDL-C level compared with those in the highest tertile; and subjects in the highest tertile of the ratio of total serum cholesterol to HDL-C level compared with those in the lowest tertile.
RESULTS: Elevated total serum cholesterol level, low HDL-C, and high total serum cholesterol to HDL-C ratio were not associated with a significantly higher rate of all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease mortality, or hospitalization for myocardial infarction or unstable angina after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. The risk factor-adjusted odds ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.99 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 2.69) for the group who had cholesterol levels greater than or equal to 6.20 mmol/L ({\textgreater} or = 240 mg/dL) compared with the group that had levels less than 5.20 mmol/L ({\textless} 200 mg/dL); 1.00 (95\% CI, 0.59 to 1.70) for the group in the lowest tertile of HDL-C compared with those in the highest tertile; and 1.03 (95\% CK, 0.62 to 1.71) for subjects in the highest tertile of the ratio of total serum cholesterol to HDL-C compared with those in the lowest tertile.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support the hypothesis that hypercholesterolemia or low HDL-C are important risk factors for all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease mortality, or hospitalization for myocardial infarction or unstable angina in this cohort of persons older than 70 years.},

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study with a follow-up of 8-10 years.
SUBJECTS: A total of 989 subjects (367 men and 622 women) aged 65 and over, living in the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area at the time of their first complete serum lipid assessment.
METHODS: We calculated sex-specific mean levels of serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein and triglycerides, and the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein, for subjects who died of all causes and for those who survived to the end of follow-up, with adjustment for relevant covariates. We obtained estimates of the risk factor-adjusted sex-specific relative risk for all-cause mortality with approximate quartiles of serum cholesterol concentrations by proportional hazards regression models. We also evaluated the possible combined effects of age, sex and cholesterol on all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A high level of high-density lipoprotein was significantly associated with a low total risk of mortality in older men. Conversely, an elevated ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein was directly related to an increased total risk of mortality in older men. Age and high-density lipoprotein level had a significant synergistic effect on all-cause mortality for the elderly men. We found little or no association in women between all-cause mortality and any of the lipid measures studied.
CONCLUSIONS: An increased ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein appears to be associated with an increase in risk for all-cause mortality in men aged 65 and over, while an elevated level of high-density lipoprotein, considered alone, seems to be protective against mortality from all causes in men aged 65-74 years, but this effect diminishes over the age of 75.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, at a population level, whether total cholesterol (TC) is a risk factor of mortality. To verify whether or not this is true for both genders.
DESIGN: Population-based, long-lasting, prospective study.
SETTING: Institutional epidemiology in primary care.
SUBJECTS: A total of 3257 subjects aged 65-95 years, recruited from Italian general population.
INTERVENTION: None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total cholesterol was measured, analysed as a continuous variable and then divided into quintiles and re-analysed. For each quintile, the multivariate relative risk (RR) of mortality adjusted for confounders was calculated in both genders. Stratification of mortality risk by TC quintiles, body mass index and cigarette smoking was also performed in both genders.
RESULTS: Total cholesterol levels directly predicted coronary mortality in men [RR being in the fifth rather than in the first quintile: 2.40 (1.40-4.14)] and any other mortality in women. It also inversely predicted miscellaneous mortality in both genders. This trend was more evident when low cholesterol was associated with malnutrition or smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: High TC remains a strong risk factor for coronary mortality in elderly men. On the other hand, having a very low cholesterol level does not prolong survival in the elderly; on the contrary, low cholesterol predicts neoplastic mortality in women and any other noncardiovascular mortality in both genders.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as a predictor of mortality in elderly subjects.
DESIGN: Population-based prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Two communities in northern Italy.
PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand one hundred twenty Caucasian subjects aged 65 and older recruited in for the Cardiovascular Study in the Elderly and followed up for 12 years.
MEASUREMENTS: Anthropometric measures: fasting plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C, glucose, creatinine, and body mass index. Clinical measures: medical assessment, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, coronary disease, heart failure, and smoking and drinking habits. Vital status measures: death certificates from the Registry Office and causes of death according to the International Classification of Diseases. After plotting mortality rates using quartiles of LDL-C, relative hazard rates (RHRs) were calculated using multivariate Cox regression analyses. When the trend was nonlinear, the RHRs were further calculated for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the distribution to confirm curvilinearity.
RESULTS: The distribution of risk of total mortality in women and of fatal heart failure in all subjects was curvilinear (non J-shaped), decreasing nonlinearly with LDL-C. For total mortality in men and cardiovascular mortality in both sexes, the relationship with LDL-C was J-shaped. The risk of fatal myocardial infarction was J-shaped in men, whereas it increased linearly with higher LDL-C in women. In both sexes, the association between stroke mortality and LDL-C was not significant.
CONCLUSION: This study adds to the uncertainty of the role of elevated levels of LDL-C as a risk factor for mortality in old people.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between admission low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and long-term outcomes has not been established in patients with acute coronary syndrome. We tested the hypothesis that patients who develop non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) despite low LDL have a worse cardiovascular outcome in the long term.
METHODS: Patients admitted with NSTEMI between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2000 and with fasting lipid profiles measured within 24 hours of admission were selected for analysis. Baseline characteristics and 3-year all-cause mortality were compared between the patients with LDL above and below the median. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the predictors of all-cause mortality, and adjusted survival was analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard model.
RESULTS: Of the total of 517 patients, 264 had LDL {\textless}or= 105 mg/dL and 253 had LDL {\textgreater} 105 mg/dL. There was no difference in age, gender, severity of coronary artery disease, and left ventricular ejection fraction between the 2 groups. Thirty-six percent of patients with LDL {\textless}or= 105 mg/dL and 24\% of patients with LDL {\textgreater} 105 mg/dL were on lipid-lowering therapy on admission. After 3 years, patients with admission LDL {\textless}or= 105 mg/dL had higher all-cause mortality rate compared to patients with LDL {\textgreater} 105 mg/dL (14.8\% vs. 7.1\%, p = 0.005). The higher all-cause mortality persisted (OR 1.8, 95\% CI 1.0-3.5, p = 0.05) even after adjustment for confounding variables.
CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, lower LDL-cholesterol at admission was associated with decreased 3-year survival in patients with NSTEMI. Whether this was a result of current therapy or a marker for worse baseline characteristics needs to be studied further.},

	abstract = {Objective It is well known that total cholesterol becomes less of a risk factor or not at all for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality with increasing age, but as little is known as to whether low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), one component of total cholesterol, is associated with mortality in the elderly, we decided to investigate this issue.
Setting, participants and outcome measures We sought PubMed for cohort studies, where LDL-C had been investigated as a risk factor for all-cause and/or CV mortality in individuals ≥60 years from the general population.
Results We identified 19 cohort studies including 30 cohorts with a total of 68 094 elderly people, where all-cause mortality was recorded in 28 cohorts and CV mortality in 9 cohorts. Inverse association between all-cause mortality and LDL-C was seen in 16 cohorts (in 14 with statistical significance) representing 92\% of the number of participants, where this association was recorded. In the rest, no association was found. In two cohorts, CV mortality was highest in the lowest LDL-C quartile and with statistical significance; in seven cohorts, no association was found.
Conclusions High LDL-C is inversely associated with mortality in most people over 60 years. This finding is inconsistent with the cholesterol hypothesis (ie, that cholesterol, particularly LDL-C, is inherently atherogenic). Since elderly people with high LDL-C live as long or longer than those with low LDL-C, our analysis provides reason to question the validity of the cholesterol hypothesis. Moreover, our study provides the rationale for a re-evaluation of guidelines recommending pharmacological reduction of LDL-C in the elderly as a component of cardiovascular disease prevention strategies.},

However, randomized controlled trials to lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and serum total cholesterol (TC) have not shown significant mortality improvements.

We used data from 37,250 patients in the international Monitoring Dialysis Outcomes (MONDO) database to evaluate the association between lipids and infection-related or CV mortality. The study began on the first day of lipid measurement and continued for up to 4 years. We applied Cox proportional models with time-varying covariates to study associations of LDL-C, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TGs) with all-cause, CV, infectious, and other causes of death. Overall, 6,147 patients died (19.2\% from CV, 13.2\% from infection, and 67.6\% from other causes). After multivariable adjustment, higher LDL-C, HDL-C, and TGs were independently associated with lower all-cause death risk. Neither LDL-C nor TGs were associated with CV death, and HDL-C was associated with lower CV risk. Higher LDL-C and HDL-C were associated with a lower risk of death from infection or other non-CV causes. LDL-C was associated with reduced all-cause and infectious, but not CV mortality, which resulted in the inverse association with all-cause mortality.},

	abstract = {Background
Hypercholesterolemia is a well-established risk factor for coronary heart disease, but the association between cholesterol level change and mortality is not fully understood. We aimed to investigate the association of 2 year (2002–2003 to 2004–2005) change in cholesterol with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a population-based cohort study.

Methods and findings
The study population consisted of 269,391 participants aged more than 40 years who were free of myocardial infarction, stroke and cancer using the Korean National Health Insurance Service—National Health Screening Cohort. Cholesterol levels were classified into 1st, 2nd and 3rd tertiles during each of the first and second health examinations, respectively. The participants were followed-up for all-cause and cause-specific mortality from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2013. Compared to participants who stayed within the 2nd tertile group for cholesterol during both the first and second examinations, participants who became or maintained cholesterol levels to the 1st tertile during the second examination had increased risk of all-cause mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) = 1.28 (1.18–1.38) in 1st/1st, 1.16 (1.07–1.26) in 2nd/1st and 1.47 (1.32–1.64) in 3rd/1st tertile levels, respectively]. In addition, increased or persistent high cholesterol levels to the 3rd tertile was associated with elevated risk for all-cause mortality [aHR (95\% CI) = 1.10 (1.01–1.20) in 1st/2nd, 1.16(1.03–1.31) in 1st/3rd and 1.15(1.05–1.25) in 3rd/3rd tertile levels].

Conclusions
Changes in cholesterol levels in either direction to low cholesterol or persistently low cholesterol levels were associated with higher risk of mortality. Particularly, spontaneous decline in cholesterol levels may be a marker for worsening health conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies in older subjects have shown no or inverse associations between cholesterol levels and mortality. However, in old age plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) may not reflect the lifetime level due to reverse causality, and hence the risk may be underestimated. In the current study, we used an LDL genetic risk score (GRS) to overcome this problem.
METHODS: A weighted GRS was created using 51 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with LDL-C levels. The LDL GRS was calculated in three Dutch cohorts: the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) (n = 3270), the Leiden 85-plus study (n = 316) and the Rotterdam Study (n = 4035). We assessed the association between the LDL GRS and LDL-C levels, chronological age, familial longevity and mortality.
RESULTS: Up to 90 years of age, in each age stratum individuals with high LDL GRS had higher LDL-C levels (P = 0.010 to P = 1.1 x 10(-16)). The frequency of LDL-increasing alleles decreased with increasing age [β = -0.021 (SE = 0.01) per year, P = 0.018]. Moreover, individuals with a genetic predisposition for longevity had significantly lower LDL GRS compared with age-matched individuals of the general population [LLS nonagenarians vs {\textgreater} 90 years: β = 0.73 (SE = 0.33), P = 0.029, LLS offspring vs partners: β = 0.66 (SE = 0.23), P = 0.005]. In longitudinal analysis, high GRS was associated with increased all-cause mortality in individuals {\textgreater} 90 years, with a 13\% increased risk in individuals with the highest LDL GRS (P-trend = 0.043).
CONCLUSION: Results of the current study indicate that a genetic predisposition to high LDL-C levels contributes to mortality throughout life, including in the oldest old, and a beneficial LDL genetic risk profile is associated with familial longevity.},

However, findings for younger people are limited, and the value of detecting and treating hypercholesterolemia in younger adults is debated.ObjectiveTo evaluate the long-term impact of unfavorable serum cholesterol levels on risk of death from CHD, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all causes.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThree prospective studies, from which were selected 3 cohorts of younger men with baseline serum cholesterol level measurements and no history of diabetes mellitus or myocardial infarction. A total of 11,017 men aged 18 through 39 years screened in 1967-1973 for the Chicago Heart Association Detection Project in Industry (CHA); 1266 men aged 25 through 39 years examined in 1959-1963 in the Peoples Gas Company Study (PG); and 69,205 men aged 35 through 39 years screened in 1973-1975 for the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT).Main Outcome MeasuresCause-specific mortality during 25 (CHA), 34 (PG), and 16 (MRFIT) years of follow-up; mortality risks; and estimated life expectancy in relation to baseline serum cholesterol levels.ResultsDeath due to CHD accounted for 26\%, 34\%, and 28\% of all deaths in the CHA, PG, and MRFIT cohorts, respectively; and CVD death for 34\%, 42\%, and 39\% of deaths in the same cohorts, respectively. Men in all 3 cohorts with unfavorable serum cholesterol levels (200-239 mg/dL [5.17-6.18 mmol/L] and ≥240 mg/dL [≥6.21 mmol/L]) had strong gradients of relative mortality risk. For men with serum cholesterol levels of 240 mg/dL or greater (≥6.21 mmol/L) vs favorable levels (\&lt;200 mg/dL [\&lt;5.17 mmol/L]), CHD mortality risk was 2.15 to 3.63 times greater; CVD disease mortality risk was 2.10 to 2.87 times greater; and all-cause mortality was 1.31 to1.49 times greater. Hypercholesterolemic men had age-adjusted absolute risk of CHD death of 59 per 1000 men in 25 years (CHA cohort), 90 per 1000 men in 34 years (PG cohort), and 15 per 1000 men in 16 years (MRFIT cohort). Absolute excess risk was 43.6 per 1000 men (CHA), 81.4 per 1000 men (PG), and 12.1 per 1000 men (MRFIT). Men with favorable baseline serum cholesterol levels had an estimated greater life expectancy of 3.8 to 8.7 years.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate a continuous, graded relationship of serum cholesterol level to long-term risk of CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality, substantial absolute risk and absolute excess risk of CHD and CVD death for younger men with elevated serum cholesterol levels, and longer estimated life expectancy for younger men with favorable serum cholesterol levels.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relation between serum lipids and risk of coronary events has been established, but there are no data demonstrating directly the relation between serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol versus serial changes in coronary plaque dimensions.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed standard analyses of serial intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) studies of 60 left main coronary arteries obtained 18.3+/-9.4 months apart to evaluate progression and regression of mild atherosclerotic plaques in relation to serum cholesterol levels. Overall, there was (1) a positive linear relation between LDL cholesterol and the annual changes in plaque plus media (P\&M) cross-sectional area (CSA) (r=0.41, P{\textless}0.0001) with (2) an LDL value of 75 mg/dL as the cutoff when regression analysis predicted on average no annual P\&M CSA increase; (3) an inverse relation between HDL cholesterol and annual changes in P\&M CSA (r=-0.30, P{\textless}0.02); (4) an inverse relation between LDL cholesterol and annual changes in lumen CSA (r=-0.32, P{\textless}0.01); and (5) no relation between LDL and HDL cholesterol and the annual changes in total arterial CSA (remodeling). Despite similar baseline IVUS characteristics, patients with an LDL cholesterol level {\textgreater} or =120 mg/dL showed more annual P\&M CSA progression and lumen reduction than patients with lower LDL cholesterol.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a positive linear relation between LDL cholesterol and annual changes in plaque size, with an LDL value of 75 mg/dL predicting, on average, no plaque progression. HDL cholesterol shows an inverse relation with annual changes in plaque size.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Prior intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) trials have demonstrated slowing or halting of atherosclerosis progression with statin therapy but have not shown convincing evidence of regression using percent atheroma volume (PAV), the most rigorous IVUS measure of disease progression and regression.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether very intensive statin therapy could regress coronary atherosclerosis as determined by IVUS imaging.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective, open-label blinded end-points trial (A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Rosuvastatin on Intravascular Ultrasound-Derived Coronary Atheroma Burden [ASTEROID]) was performed at 53 community and tertiary care centers in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. A motorized IVUS pullback was used to assess coronary atheroma burden at baseline and after 24 months of treatment. Each pair of baseline and follow-up IVUS assessments was analyzed in a blinded fashion.
PATIENTS: Between November 2002 and October 2003, 507 patients had a baseline IVUS examination and received at least 1 dose of study drug. After 24 months, 349 patients had evaluable serial IVUS examinations.
INTERVENTION: All patients received intensive statin therapy with rosuvastatin, 40 mg/d.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Two primary efficacy parameters were prespecified: the change in PAV and the change in nominal atheroma volume in the 10-mm subsegment with the greatest disease severity at baseline. A secondary efficacy variable, change in normalized total atheroma volume for the entire artery, was also prespecified.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of 130.4 (34.3) mg/dL declined to 60.8 (20.0) mg/dL, a mean reduction of 53.2\% (P{\textless}.001). Mean (SD) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level at baseline was 43.1 (11.1) mg/dL, increasing to 49.0 (12.6) mg/dL, an increase of 14.7\% (P{\textless}.001). The mean (SD) change in PAV for the entire vessel was -0.98\% (3.15\%), with a median of -0.79\% (97.5\% CI, -1.21\% to -0.53\%) (P{\textless}.001 vs baseline). The mean (SD) change in atheroma volume in the most diseased 10-mm subsegment was -6.1 (10.1) mm3, with a median of -5.6 mm3 (97.5\% CI, -6.8 to -4.0 mm3) (P{\textless}.001 vs baseline). Change in total atheroma volume showed a 6.8\% median reduction; with a mean (SD) reduction of -14.7 (25.7) mm3, with a median of -12.5 mm3 (95\% CI, -15.1 to -10.5 mm3) (P{\textless}.001 vs baseline). Adverse events were infrequent and similar to other statin trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Very high-intensity statin therapy using rosuvastatin 40 mg/d achieved an average LDL-C of 60.8 mg/dL and increased HDL-C by 14.7\%, resulting in significant regression of atherosclerosis for all 3 prespecified IVUS measures of disease burden. Treatment to LDL-C levels below currently accepted guidelines, when accompanied by significant HDL-C increases, can regress atherosclerosis in coronary disease patients. Further studies are needed to determine the effect of the observed changes on clinical outcome.

	abstract = {Objective
Daily energy expenditure consists of three components: basal metabolic rate, diet-induced thermogenesis and the energy cost of physical activity. Here, data on diet-induced thermogenesis are reviewed in relation to measuring conditions and characteristics of the diet.

Methods
Measuring conditions include nutritional status of the subject, physical activity and duration of the observation. Diet characteristics are energy content and macronutrient composition.

Results
Most studies measure diet-induced thermogenesis as the increase in energy expenditure above basal metabolic rate. Generally, the hierarchy in macronutrient oxidation in the postprandial state is reflected similarly in diet-induced thermogenesis, with the sequence alcohol, protein, carbohydrate, and fat. A mixed diet consumed at energy balance results in a diet induced energy expenditure of 5 to 15 \% of daily energy expenditure. Values are higher at a relatively high protein and alcohol consumption and lower at a high fat consumption. Protein induced thermogenesis has an important effect on satiety., In conclusion, the main determinants of diet-induced thermogenesis are the energy content and the protein- and alcohol fraction of the diet. Protein plays a key role in body weight regulation through satiety related to diet-induced thermogenesis.},

This fact is often misinterpreted to suggest that obesity is caused by gluttony and sloth and can be treated by simply advising people to eat less and move more. Rather various components of energy balance are dynamically interrelated and weight loss is resisted by counterbalancing physiological processes. While low-carbohydrate diets have been suggested to partially subvert these processes by increasing energy expenditure and promoting fat loss, our meta-analysis of 32 controlled feeding studies with isocaloric substitution of carbohydrate for fat found that both energy expenditure (26 kcal/d; P {\textless}.0001) and fat loss (16 g/d; P {\textless}.0001) were greater with lower fat diets. We review the components of energy balance and the mechanisms acting to resist weight loss in the context of static, settling point, and set-point models of body weight regulation, with the set-point model being most commensurate with current data.},

This study determined whether isocaloric substitution of starch for sugar would improve metabolic parameters in Latino (n = 27) and African-American (n = 16) children with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Methods Participants consumed a diet for 9 days to deliver comparable percentages of protein, fat, and carbohydrate as their self-reported diet; however, dietary sugar was reduced from 28\% to 10\% and substituted with starch. Participants recorded daily weights, with calories adjusted for weight maintenance. Participants underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and oral glucose tolerance testing on Days 0 and 10. Biochemical analyses were controlled for weight change by repeated measures ANCOVA. Results Reductions in diastolic blood pressure (−5 mmHg; P = 0.002), lactate (−0.3 mmol/L; P {\textless} 0.001), triglyceride, and LDL-cholesterol (−46\% and −0.3 mmol/L; P {\textless} 0.001) were noted.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES
The aim of the study was to determine the value of a cluster of metabolic risk factors in predicting mortality after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).
BACKGROUND
The “deadly quartet” of metabolic risk factors (i.e., obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia) has been associated with coronary heart disease in healthy population studies. The expected influence of the cluster on survival in secondary prevention remains untested overall as well as by gender.
METHODS
Patients with lipid profiles undergoing primary isolated CABG (n = 6,428) between 1987 and 1992 were followed a median of eight years. Cox models were used to evaluate all-cause mortality. Metabolic risk factors were incorporated as the sum of deadly quartet risk factors present in each patient (0 to 4). The role of gender as it relates to survival and metabolic risk clusters was also examined.
RESULTS
The sum of deadly quartet risk factors showed a significant relationship to mortality as the hazard ratio increased from 1.64 (confidence interval [CI] = 1.34–2.01) for one risk factor to 3.95 (2.73–5.69) for four risk factors. Annualized mortality ranged from 1\% per year in patients with no risk factors to 3.3\% per year in patients with all four risk factors. Within gender, the hazard ratio associated with four risk factors was 2.58 for men and 13.39 for women. The expected clustering of risk factors was 8\% compared to the observed clustering of 10\% in men and 21\% in women.
CONCLUSIONS
This cohort showed risk factor clustering beyond that expected due to chance, particularly in women. Even after revascularization, survival is diminished for patients with members of a family of metabolic risk factors at the time of surgery.},

Mice fed 20\% saturated fat were almost completely protected from UV tumorigenesis when compared with mice fed 20\% polyunsaturated fat.

Each diet contained 20\% of fat by weight, with varying amounts of coconut oil and corn oil added to achieve the desired levels of linoleate. Mammary tumorigenesis was very sensitive to linoleate intake and increased proportionately in the range of 0.5 to 4.4\% of dietary linoleate. Regression analysis indicated that a breakpoint occurred at 4.4\%, beyond which there was a very poor linear relationship, suggesting the possibility of a plateau. From the intersection of the regression lines in both the upper and lower ranges, the level of linoleate required to elicit the maximal tumorigenic response was estimated to be around 4\%. The differences in tumor yield could not be correlated with changes in prostaglandin E concentration in the mammary fat pads of normal animals maintained on similar diets, suggesting that linoleate may act by some other mechanism to stimulate mammary tumorigenesis.},

The rats were fed two types of semipurified diets consisting of 5\% linoleic acid or 4.7\% stearic acid plus 0.3\% essential fatty acid as dietary fats. The rats were treated with azoxymethane (7.4 mg/kg body weight) s.c. once a week for 11 weeks and sacrificed 15 weeks after the last injection of the carcinogen. The rats fed unsaturated fat diet demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of colon tumors [100\%], more tumors per rat [2.68 +/- 1.60 (S.D.)], and greater malignant differentiation histologically than did those fed saturated fat diet [76\%, 1.79 +/- 1.59, respectively]. Lipid analysis of colon tumors and colon mucosa showed that unsaturated fat diet altered the phosphatide fatty acyl composition of colon mucosa markedly and increased the content of arachidonic acid in the neutral lipid of colon tumors. The altered lipid composition of the mucosa may increase the sensitivity of the colon to the carcinogen, and the excess of arachidonic acid or its metabolites may be the primary agents of cocarcinogenesis of colon tumors. These findings suggest that dietary unsaturated fats have potent cocarcinogenic effects on colon carcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {Diet has been shown to modulate the incidence of a wide variety of chemically induced cancers in animals. Various diets fed either during the initiation stage or the postinitiation (promotion) stage of carcinogenesis were evaluated for their ability to modulate the incidence of pancreatic cancer. Male Wistar/Lewis rats were treated with multiple injections of the pancreatic carcinogen, azaserine, during a 6- to 7-week-long initiation phase and were autopsied after a postinitiation phase of 34 or 44 weeks. The following diets were evaluated for their effects on the incidence of pancreatic neoplasms during each stage of carcinogenesis: high saturated fat; two high unsaturated fats (corn oil and safflower oil); low protein; and caloric restricted. A purified control diet was fed during that stage when the test diets were not fed. The incidence of pancreatic adenomas and adenocarcinomas was evaluated by light microscopy. Feeding of the caloric-restricted diet during the initiation phase suppressed the pancreatic neoplasm incidence. None of the ther diets tested had an effect on the incidence of pancreatic cancer during the initiation phase. During the postinitiation phase, both high-unsaturated-fat diets but not the high-saturated-fat diet significantly elevated the pancreatic neoplasm incidence. The low-protein and caloric-restricted diets had no effect on the neoplasm incidence when fed during the postinitiation phase. Thus, diets high in unsaturated fat appear to promote pancreatic carcinogenesis in the azaserine-treated rat while a diet high in saturated fat failed to show a similar degree of enhancement of pancreatic carcinogenesis.},

Analysis of tumor incidence, latency, and multiplicity data obtained from the 7 experimental groups indicated that animals fed the HF safflower and corn oil diets exhibited enhanced mammary tumor yields when compared to animals fed HF olive or coconut oil diets or their LF counterparts. Since weight gains and total caloric intake were similar in all 4 HF groups, the results of this study indicate that the tumor-promoting properties of HF diets are more of a function of differences in fatty acid composition than of fat content per se or of total caloric intake.},

Rats were fed diets containing either safflower, corn, or olive oil at either 23 (HF) or 5\% (LF) in the diet (w/w). Coconut oil was fed to one group at 23\% (w/w). It was found that animals fed HF diets rich in linoleic acid, such as safflower and corn oil, exhibited increased incidence and decreased latent period compared with either their LF counterparts or animals fed HF diets rich in oleic acid (olive oil) or medium-chain saturated fatty acids (coconut oil). Analysis of tumor lipid fatty acid content indicated that tumor-neutral lipids reflected the diet whereas tumor phospholipids did not. Moreover, tumor prostaglandins (PGE2) were high in the two high-incidence groups (HF safflower and corn) and low in the two low-incidence groups (HF olive and coconut). These results indicate that HF intake is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for mammary tumor promotion, and that the proportion of essential polyunsaturates vis a vis monounsaturates and saturates is a critical determinant of the fat effect. In addition, our studies suggest that alterations in the metabolism of linoleic acid to (prosta . . .) prostaglandins may underlie the fat effect. Dose-response studies in the same model, using four different levels of corn oil, suggest that instead of a linear relationship with respect to tumor incidence, there appears to be a threshold lying between 20 and 33\% fat as calories, above which tumor promotion is manifested and below which it is not.},

The cumulative tumor incidence curves were similar for the MCT and LF:corn oil groups (p less than 0.9); however, both curves were significantly different from that of the HF:corn oil group (p less than 0.0099). No differences were found in tumor multiplicity, tumor size, or body weight gain in any of the treatment groups. Assay of serum total cholesterol and triglycerides showed that consumption of 23\% corn oil diet significantly depressed serum cholesterol (but not triglyceride) levels compared to the LF:5\% corn oil- and the HF:MCT-containing diets. Analysis of serum fatty acid profiles indicated that animals fed 23\% corn oil exhibited twice the amount of linoleic acid (C18:2) as did those fed either 5\% corn oil or MCT. Differences in other fatty acids were of a much lesser magnitude. These results indicate that the mammary tumor-promoting effect of a HF diet can be diminished by substituting saturated MCT for the more common longer-unsaturated-chain triglycerides. In addition, they suggest an association between promotion of mammary cancer and elevated levels of linoleic acid in serum lipids.},

The animals were fed low-fat diets containing 5\% CO, 5\% SO, or 5\% OO 2 weeks before, during, and 1 week after sc injection of 20 mg AOM/kg body weight. One week after the AOM treatment, groups of animals were transferred to high-fat diets containing 23.52\% CO, 23.52\% SO, 23.52\% OO, and 23.52\% CC, or 5.88\% CO + 17.64\% MCT; the remaining animals were continued on 5\% fat diets. All animals were fed these diets until the termination of the experiment. Body weights and intakes of calories, protein, and micronutrients were comparable among the various dietary groups. The incidence of colon tumors was increased in rats fed diets containing high-CO and high-SO compared to those fed low-CO and low-SO diets, whereas the diets containing high OO, CC, or MCT had no promoting effect on colon tumor incidence. There was a significant increase in the excretion of fecal deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, and 12-ketolithocholic acid in animals fed the high-CO and high-SO diets and no difference in these secondary bile acids excretion in animals fed the high-OO and high-CC diets compared to those animals fed their respective 5\% fat diets. This study thus indicates that not only the amount of dietary fat but also the fatty acid composition (type) of fat are important factors in the determination of the promoting effect in colon carcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {The effect of selenium depletion on mammary tumorigenesis following dimethylbenz[a]anthracene administration was examined in female Sprague-Dawley rats that were fed different levels and types of fats. Four basal diets deficient in selenium were used: (a) 1\% corn oil; (b) 5\% corn oil; (c) 25\% corn oil; and (d) a high saturated fat diet containing 1\% corn oil and 24\% hydrogenated coconut oil. The comparable selenium-adequate diets were obtained by adding 0.1 ppm of selenium to each of the basal diets. In animals that received an adequate supplement of selenium, an increase in fat intake was accompanied by an increased tumor incidence when corn oil was used in the diets. A high saturated fat ration, on the other hand, was much less effective in this respect. Only in those rats that were maintained on a high polyunsaturated fat diet (25\% corn oil) did selenium depletion result in a further increase in tumor incidence and tumor yield. Such an augmentation was not observed in animals given either a 1 or a 5\% corn oil ration or a diet rich in saturated fat. Regardless of selenium status, almost all of the tumors found were adenocarcinomas. An enhancement of tumorigenesis as a result of selenium deficiency in rats fed the 1\% corn oil regimen was detected provided a high dose of dimethylbenz[a]anthracene was used, suggesting that alterations in dimethylbenz[a]anthracene metabolism might be involved under this condition. The antioxidant property of selenium is discussed as a possible mechanism by which selenium protects against tumorigenesis, especially in animals with a high polyunsaturated fat intake.},

The rats were killed 12 weeks after treatment with DMBA (a single dvse of 10 mg/rat) and maintenance on these diets.

The protective antitumor effect of the olive diet was found to be connected to its dietary content of monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic and palmitic acids and with serum concentrations of stearic acid. The promotive tumorigenic effects of the other high-fat diets were associated with their high levels of some polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic and alinolenic). Malignant mammary tissue exhibited higher values than benign tissue for all the argyrophilic-nucleolar-organizer region parameters measured. The tumor-associated protein p53 was accumulated to high levels in the blood of tumor-bearing rats, but not in that of the non tumor-bearing rats.},

Eleven different fats and oils and nine mixtures of these fats and oils were selected so that the levels of the nine major fatty acids varied over a reasonable range and were not highly correlated with one another. Tumor incidence was observed in mice raised on diets containing 10\% of these different fats. Multiple regressions have been calculated, expressing tumor incidence or time to tumor as a function of the levels of nine fatty acids, four saturated and five unsaturated, of the dietary lipids. Increased tumor incidence and decreased time to tumor were observed when increasing levels of linoleate (18:2) replaced the eight other fatty acids in the diet while the other polyunsaturated fatty acid, linolenate (18: 3), had little effect on tumor incidence. Four saturated fatty acids, laureate (12:0), myristate (14:0), palmitate (16:0), and stearate (18:0), were studied, with only the latter showing a significant effect. Increasing levels of stearate were associated with decreased tumor incidence and increased time to tumor. There was also a suggestion that erucic acid (22:1) reduced tumor incidence, but oleic acid (19:1) produced no significant effect.},

Stearate has been shown to have anti-cancer properties during early stages of neoplastic progression. However, previous studies have not investigated the effect of dietary stearate on breast cancer metastasis. In this study, we present evidence that exogenously supplied dietary stearate dramatically reduces the size of tumors that formed from injected human breast cancer cells within the mammary fat pads of athymic nude mice by approximately 50\% and partially inhibits breast cancer cell metastasis burden in the lungs in this mouse model system. This metastatic inhibition appears to be independent of primary tumor size, as stearate fed animals that had primary tumors comparable in size to littermates fed either a safflower oil enriched diet or a low fat diet had reduced lung metastasis. Also stearate fed mice sub-groups had different primary tumor sizes but no difference in metastasis. This anti-metastasis effect may be due, at least in part, to the ability of stearate to induce apoptosis in these human breast cancer cells. Overall, this study suggests the possibility of dietary manipulation with selected long-chain saturated fatty acids such as stearate as a potential adjuvant therapeutic strategy for breast cancer patients wishing to maximize the suppression of metastatic disease.},

Morphological analysis, cell viability, and caspase-3 activity assays demonstrated that stearate activated apoptosis preferentially in cancerous breast cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of de novo diacylgycerol synthesis or protein kinase C (PKC) blocked stearate-induced caspase-3 activity, indicating the involvement of a novel or classical PKC isozyme.

Placing mice on the SA diet at 11.5 months resulted in a smaller but significant increase in the latency period (5.0 +/- 0.86 vs 3.0 +/- 0.57 months +/- 0.57 mo), (p less than .05). Fatty acid analyses of non-tumorous mammary tissue from mid-pregnant mice and of tumor tissues showed that feeding large amounts of 18:0 did not result in increases in the proportion of 18:0. Significant reductions in the percentages of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was found in tissues on mice fed the SA diet. The percentage of 18:2 was reduced in both types of tissues; 20:3 and 20:4 was reduced in tumor tissues. Distribution of C18 fatty acids in plasma membranes of tumors of mice fed the two diets were similar; percentages 18:2 was higher in plasma membranes of non-tumorous tissues of mice fed the SA diet.

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that stearate (C18:0), a dietary long-chain saturated fatty acid, inhibits breast cancer cell neoplastic progression; however, little is known about the mechanism modulating these processes. We demonstrate that stearate, at physiological concentrations, inhibits cell cycle progression in human breast cancer cells at both the G(1) and G(2) phases. Stearate also increases cell cycle inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1) levels and concomitantly decreases cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) phosphorylation. Our data also show that stearate induces Ras- guanosine triphosphate formation and causes increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK). The MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, reversed stearate-induced p21(CIP1/WAF1) upregulation, but only partially restored stearate-induced dephosphorylation of Cdk2. The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK pathway has been linked to cell cycle regulation but generally in a positive way. Interestingly, we found that stearate inhibits both Rho activation and expression in vitro. In addition, constitutively active RhoC reversed stearate-induced upregulation of p27(KIP1), providing further evidence of Rho involvement. To test the effect of stearate in vivo, we used the N-Nitroso-N-methylurea rat breast cancer carcinogen model. We found that dietary stearate reduces the incidence of carcinogen-induced mammary cancer and reduces tumor burden. Importantly, mammary tumor cells from rats on a stearate diet had reduced expression of RhoA and B as well as total Rho compared with a low-fat diet. Overall, these data indicate that stearate inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting key check points in the cell cycle as well as Rho expression in vitro and in vivo and inhibits tumor burden and carcinogen-induced mammary cancer in vivo.},

While several studies suggest beneficial effects of lower sodium on cardiovascular disease, the relationship with total mortality remains controversial. Some have reported a J-shaped curve, but this may be due to poor quality measurement of sodium or confounding bias.

Objective
To examine the relationship of well-characterized measures of sodium intake, estimated from urinary sodium excretion, with long-term mortality.

Methods
Two trials [Phase I (1987-90) over 18 month and Phase II (1990-5) over 36 months in the Trials of Hypertension Prevention] implemented sodium reduction interventions. Multiple 24-hour urines were collected from pre-hypertensive adults aged 30-54 during these trial periods. Post-trial deaths were ascertained over a median 24 years through December 31, 2013 using the National Death Index. The association of mortality with both the randomized intervention and average sodium intake was examined.

Results
Among 744 Phase I and 2382 Phase II participants randomized to sodium reduction or control, 251 deaths occurred, with a nonsignificant 15\% lower risk in the active intervention (hazard ratio (HR)=0.85, 95\% CI=0.66-1.09, p=0.19). Among 2,974 participants not assigned to an active sodium intervention, 272 deaths occurred. There was a direct linear association of average sodium intake with mortality, with HR=0.75, 0.95, 1.00 (reference), and 1.07 (p-trend = 0.30) for {\textless}2300, 2300-{\textless}3600, 3600-{\textless}4800, and {\textgreater}=4800 mg/24hr, respectively, with HR=1.12 per 1000 mg/24hr (95\% CI = 1.00-1.26, p=0.05) and no evidence of a J-shape or nonlinear relation. The HR per unit increase in sodium/potassium ratio was 1.13 (95\% CI = 1.01-1.27, p=0.04).

Conclusions
This study, with carefully characterized measures of sodium intake, found an increased risk at high sodium intake and a direct relation with total mortality even at the lowest levels of sodium intake. Overall, these results are consistent with a benefit of reduced sodium and sodium/potassium on total mortality over a period of over 20 years.},

	abstract = {Insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinaemia commonly occur in patients with untreated essential hypertension. The coexistence of insulin resistance and hypertension can be viewed as a cause-effect relationship (insulin resistance as a cause of hypertension or vice versa) or as a noncausal association. Insulin can increase blood pressure via several mechanisms: increased renal sodium reabsorption, activation of the sympathetic nervous system, alteration of transmembrane ion transport, and hypertrophy of resistance vessels. Conversely, hypertension can cause insulin resistance by altering the delivery of insulin and glucose to skeletal muscle cells, resulting in impaired glucose uptake. For example, hypertension can impair vasodilation of skeletal muscle as a result of vascular structural changes and rarefaction, and increased response to vasoconstrictor stimuli. Also, the prevalence of muscle type 2b fibres (fast twitch fibres) may contribute to the development of insulin resistance. The common pathogenetic mechanism for both insulin resistance and hypertension could be activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This results in vasoconstriction, and may contribute to the genesis of vascular structural changes and increase the number of fast twitch fibres. Finally, hypertension and insulin resistance can be viewed as a noncausal association, according to the following hypotheses: 1) they may represent 2 independent consequences of the same metabolic disorder (intracellular free calcium accumulation), or 2) insulin resistance is a genetic marker and/or a pathogenetic mechanism of multiple metabolic abnormalities frequently associated with hypertension.},

	abstract = {Background
While several studies suggest beneficial effects of lower sodium on cardiovascular disease, the relationship with total mortality remains controversial. Some have reported a J-shaped curve, but this may be due to poor quality measurement of sodium or confounding bias.

Objective
To examine the relationship of well-characterized measures of sodium intake, estimated from urinary sodium excretion, with long-term mortality.

Methods
Two trials [Phase I (1987-90) over 18 month and Phase II (1990-5) over 36 months in the Trials of Hypertension Prevention] implemented sodium reduction interventions. Multiple 24-hour urines were collected from pre-hypertensive adults aged 30-54 during these trial periods. Post-trial deaths were ascertained over a median 24 years through December 31, 2013 using the National Death Index. The association of mortality with both the randomized intervention and average sodium intake was examined.

Results
Among 744 Phase I and 2382 Phase II participants randomized to sodium reduction or control, 251 deaths occurred, with a nonsignificant 15\% lower risk in the active intervention (hazard ratio (HR)=0.85, 95\% CI=0.66-1.09, p=0.19). Among 2,974 participants not assigned to an active sodium intervention, 272 deaths occurred. There was a direct linear association of average sodium intake with mortality, with HR=0.75, 0.95, 1.00 (reference), and 1.07 (p-trend = 0.30) for {\textless}2300, 2300-{\textless}3600, 3600-{\textless}4800, and {\textgreater}=4800 mg/24hr, respectively, with HR=1.12 per 1000 mg/24hr (95\% CI = 1.00-1.26, p=0.05) and no evidence of a J-shape or nonlinear relation. The HR per unit increase in sodium/potassium ratio was 1.13 (95\% CI = 1.01-1.27, p=0.04).

Conclusions
This study, with carefully characterized measures of sodium intake, found an increased risk at high sodium intake and a direct relation with total mortality even at the lowest levels of sodium intake. Overall, these results are consistent with a benefit of reduced sodium and sodium/potassium on total mortality over a period of over 20 years.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). We recently reported that glycemic control in patients with T2D can be significantly improved through a continuous care intervention (CCI) including nutritional ketosis. The purpose of this study was to examine CVD risk factors in this cohort.
METHODS: We investigated CVD risk factors in patients with T2D who participated in a 1 year open label, non-randomized, controlled study. The CCI group (n = 262) received treatment from a health coach and medical provider. A usual care (UC) group (n = 87) was independently recruited to track customary T2D progression. Circulating biomarkers of cholesterol metabolism and inflammation, blood pressure (BP), carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), multi-factorial risk scores and medication use were examined. A significance level of P {\textless} 0.0019 ensured two-tailed significance at the 5\% level when Bonferroni adjusted for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: The CCI group consisted of 262 participants (baseline mean (SD): age 54 (8) year, BMI 40.4 (8.8) kg m-2). Intention-to-treat analysis (\% change) revealed the following at 1-year: total LDL-particles (LDL-P) (- 4.9\%, P = 0.02), small LDL-P (- 20.8\%, P = 1.2 × 10-12), LDL-P size (+ 1.1\%, P = 6.0 × 10-10), ApoB (- 1.6\%, P = 0.37), ApoA1 (+ 9.8\%, P {\textless} 10-16), ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (- 9.5\%, P = 1.9 × 10-7), triglyceride/HDL-C ratio (- 29.1\%, P {\textless} 10-16), large VLDL-P (- 38.9\%, P = 4.2 × 10-15), and LDL-C (+ 9.9\%, P = 4.9 × 10-5). Additional effects were reductions in blood pressure, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and white blood cell count (all P {\textless} 1 × 10-7) while cIMT was unchanged. The 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score decreased - 11.9\% (P = 4.9 × 10-5). Antihypertensive medication use was discontinued in 11.4\% of CCI participants (P = 5.3 × 10-5). The UC group of 87 participants [baseline mean (SD): age 52 (10) year, BMI 36.7 (7.2) kg m-2] showed no significant changes. After adjusting for baseline differences when comparing CCI and UC groups, significant improvements for the CCI group included small LDL-P, ApoA1, triglyceride/HDL-C ratio, HDL-C, hsCRP, and LP-IR score in addition to other biomarkers that were previously reported. The CCI group showed a greater rise in LDL-C.
CONCLUSIONS: A continuous care treatment including nutritional ketosis in patients with T2D improved most biomarkers of CVD risk after 1 year. The increase in LDL-cholesterol appeared limited to the large LDL subfraction. LDL particle size increased, total LDL-P and ApoB were unchanged, and inflammation and blood pressure decreased.

We sought to determine the long-term associations of various LDL-C and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) thresholds and CVD and coronary heart disease mortality in a large, low 10-year risk cohort.Methods:The study sample included participants of the CCLS (Cooper Center Longitudinal Study) without a history of CVD or diabetes mellitus and defined as low risk ({\textless}7.5\%) for 10-year atherosclerotic CVD events at baseline based on Pooled Cohort Risk Assessment Equations. The associations of fasting LDL-C and non–HDL-C with CVD mortality were tested with Cox proportional hazards models.Results:In 36 375 participants (72\% men, median age 42) followed for a median of 26.8 years, 1086 CVD and 598 coronary heart disease deaths occurred. Compared with LDL-C {\textless}100 mg/dL, LDL-C categories 100 to 129 mg/dL, 130 to 159 mg/dL, 160 to 189.9 mg/dL, and ≥190 mg/dL were associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD death, with hazard ratios of 1.4 (95\% CI, 1.1–1.7), 1.3 (95\% CI, 1.1–1.6), 1.9 (95\% CI, 1.5–2.4), and 1.7 (95\% CI, 1.3–2.3), and mean reductions in years free of CVD death of 1.8, 1.1, 4.3, and 3.9, respectively. After adjustment for atherosclerotic CVD risk factors, LDL-C categories 160 to 189 mg/dL and ≥190 mg/dL remained independently associated with CVD mortality, with hazard ratios of 1.7 (95\% CI, 1.4–2.2) and 1.5 (95\% CI, 1.2–2.1), respectively. In multivariable-adjusted models using non–HDL-C {\textless}130 mg/dL as the reference, non–HDL-C 160 to 189 mg/dL, 190 to 219 mg/dL, and ≥220 mg/dL were significantly associated with CVD death, with hazard ratios of 1.3 (95\% CI, 1.1–1.6), 1.8 (95\% CI, 1.4–2.2), and 1.5 (95\% CI, 1.2–2.0), respectively. Restricting the cohort to those with 10-year risk {\textless}5\% did not diminish the associations of LDL-C and non–HDL-C with CVD mortality.Conclusions:In a low 10-year risk cohort with long-term follow-up, LDL-C and non–HDL-C ≥160 mg/dL were independently associated with a 50\% to 80\% increased relative risk of CVD mortality. These findings may have implications for future cholesterol treatment paradigms.},

We therefore sought to evaluate long-term coronary heart disease (CHD) and total ASCVD risks in US adults with an FH phenotype.Methods:Using individual pooled data from 6 large US epidemiological cohorts, we stratified participants by low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level at index ages from 20 to 79 years. For the primary analysis, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 and {\textless}130 mg/dL defined the FH phenotype and referent, respectively. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the effects of varying the FH phenotype definition. We used Cox regression models to assess covariate-adjusted associations of the FH phenotype with 30-year hazards for CHD (CHD death or nonfatal myocardial infarction) and total ASCVD (CHD or stroke).Results:We included 68 565 baseline person-examinations; 3850 (5.6\%) had the FH phenotype by the primary definition. Follow-up across index ages ranged from 78 985 to 308 378 person-years. After covariate adjustment, the FH phenotype was associated with substantially elevated 30-year CHD risk, with hazard ratios up to 5.0 (95\% confidence interval, 1.1–21.7). Across index ages, CHD risk was accelerated in those with the FH phenotype by 10 to 20 years in men and 20 to 30 years in women. Similar patterns of results were found for total ASCVD risk, with hazard ratios up to 4.1 (95\% confidence interval, 1.2–13.4). Alternative FH phenotype definitions incorporating family history, more stringent age-based low-density lipoprotein cholesterol thresholds, or alternative lipid fractions decreased the FH phenotype prevalence to as low as 0.2\% to 0.4\% without materially affecting CHD risk estimates (hazard ratios up to 8.0; 95\% confidence interval, 1.0–61.6).Conclusions:In the general US population, the long-term ASCVD burden related to phenotypic FH, defined by low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥190 mg/dL, is likely substantial. Our finding of CHD risk acceleration may aid efforts in risk communication.},

	abstract = {Background
Elevated plasma cholesterol promotes the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in which monocyte-derived lipid-laden macrophages are frequently found. To analyze, if circulating monocytes already show increased lipid content and differences in lipoprotein metabolism, we compared monocytes from patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) with those from healthy individuals.

Methods
Cholesterol and oxidized cholesterol metabolite serum levels of FH and of healthy, gender/age matched control subjects were measured by combined gas chromatography – mass spectroscopy. Monocytes from patients with FH and from healthy subjects were isolated by antibody-assisted density centrifugation. Gene expression profiles of isolated monocytes were measured using Affymetrix HG-U 133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. We compared monocyte gene expression profiles from FH patients with healthy controls using a Welch T-test with correction for multiple testing (p {\textless} 0.05; Benjamini Hochberg correction, False Discovery Rate = 0.05). The differential expression of FH associated genes was validated at the mRNA level by qRT-PCR and/or at the protein level by Western Blot or flow cytometry. Functional validation of monocyte scavenger receptor activities were done by binding assays and dose/time dependent uptake analysis using native and oxidized LDL.

Results
Using microarray analysis we found in FH patients a significant up-regulation of 1,617 genes and a down-regulation of 701 genes compared to monocytes from healthy individuals. These include genes of proteins that are involved in the uptake, biosynthesis, disposition, and cellular efflux of cholesterol. In addition, plasma from FH patients contains elevated amounts of sterols and oxysterols. An increased uptake of oxidized as well as of native LDL by FH monocytes combined with a down-regulation of NPC1 and ABCA1 explains the lipid accumulation observed in these cells.

Conclusion
Our data demonstrate that circulating FH monocytes show differences in cell physiology that may contribute to the early onset of atherosclerosis in this disease.},

Disability was assessed with the modified Ranking Score (mRS), of which a cutoff score â‰¥2 indicates disability. Statistical analysis included chi-square tests, two independent samples t-tests, Mann-Whitney U test and multiple logistic regression analysis. The frequency of disability in this study population was 45\%. Multivariate analyses revealed that older age, lower education level, previous history of stroke, stroke severity at admission, depression, cognitive impairment at 3 months, and stroke recurrence within 5 years follow up were all significantly associated with post-stroke disability. The disability rate in 5-year post-stroke was high in Chinese patients. Treatment of depression, secondary prevention of stroke and rehabilitation may benefit disabled patients with stroke in China.},

Chronic disease can contribute to functional disability, which can degrade quality of life. However, the prevalence of functional disability and its association with outcomes among patients with heart failure (HF) requires further study.

Methods and Results
Southeastern Minnesota residents with HF were enrolled from September 2003 through January 2012 into a cohort study with follow-up through December 2012. Difficulty with 9 ADLs was assessed by questionnaire. Patients were divided into 3 categories of ADL difficulty (no/minimal, moderate, severe). The associations of ADL difficulty with mortality and hospitalization were assessed using Cox and Andersen-Gill models. Among 1128 patients (mean age 74.7 years, 49.2\% female), a majority (59.4\%) reported difficulty with one or more ADLs at enrollment, with 272 (24.1\%) and 146 (12.9\%) experiencing moderate and severe difficulty, respectively. After a mean (SD) follow-up of 3.2 (2.4) years, 614 (54.4\%) patients had died. Mortality increased with increasing ADL difficulty; the HR (95\% CI) for death was 1.49 (1.22–1.82) and 2.26 (1.79–2.86) for those with moderate and severe difficulty, respectively, compared to those with no/minimal difficulty (ptrend {\textless}0.001). Patients with moderate and severe difficulty were at increased risk for all-cause and non-cardiovascular hospitalization. In a second assessment, 17.7\% of survivors reported more difficulty with ADLs and patients with persistently severe or worsening difficulty were at increased risk for death (HR 2.10, 95\% CI 1.71–2.58, p{\textless}0.001) and hospitalization (HR 1.51, 95\% CI 1.31–1.74, p{\textless}0.001).

Conclusions
Functional disability is common in patients with HF, can progress over time, and is associated with adverse prognosis.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Quality of life measures are useful when interventions or treatments are indicated for several reasons such as improvement of physical functioning, pain relief, to estimate the effectiveness of therapies or to predict mortality. The aim of the current study was to describe quality of life in patients with stable coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction and heart failure and to evaluate the relationship between depression and health-related quality of life.

Material and methods
Patients after STEMI, with stable coronary artery disease, and heart failure (n = 332) completed the MacNew Heart Disease Health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.

Results
Patients with myocardial infarction had significantly higher scores than patients with stable coronary artery disease or heart failure on the MacNew global scale (p {\textless} 0.001) and the physical (p {\textless} 0.001), emotional (p {\textless} 0.001) and social (p {\textless} 0.001) subscales. The anxiety scores were significantly higher in the group of patients with stable coronary artery disease than in patients with myocardial infarction (p {\textless} 0.05). The depression scores were significantly higher in patients with heart failure (p {\textless} 0.01).

Conclusions
In patients with stable CAD, anxiety correlated mainly with symptoms, i.e. angina, than with the history of MI. Patients with symptoms of angina react to the illness with anxiety more than depression, whereas patients with heart failure with dyspnea react to the illness with depressive symptoms more than anxiety. In patients after MI and with stable CAD, cognitive-behavioral techniques could be useful to quickly reduce the level of anxiety, while patients with heart failure require long-term support therapy to reduce the risk of depressive symptoms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rare mutations of the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene (LDLR) cause familial hypercholesterolemia, which increases the risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). Less is known about the implications of common genetic variation in the LDLR gene regarding the variability of cholesterol levels and risk of CAD.
METHODS: Imputed genotype data at the LDLR locus on 1 644 individuals of a population-based sample were explored for association with LDL-C level. Replication of association with LDL-C level was sought for the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the LDLR gene in three European samples comprising 6 642 adults and 533 children. Association of this SNP with CAD was examined in six case-control studies involving more than 15 000 individuals.
FINDINGS: Each copy of the minor T allele of SNP rs2228671 within LDLR (frequency 11\%) was related to a decrease of LDL-C levels by 0.19 mmol/L (95\% confidence interval (CI) [0.13-0.24] mmol/L, p = 1.5x10(-10)). This association with LDL-C was uniformly found in children, men, and women of all samples studied. In parallel, the T allele of rs2228671 was associated with a significantly lower risk of CAD (Odds Ratio per copy of the T allele: 0.82, 95\% CI [0.76-0.89], p = 2.1x10(-7)). Adjustment for LDL-C levels by logistic regression or Mendelian Randomisation models abolished the significant association between rs2228671 with CAD completely, indicating a functional link between the genetic variant at the LDLR gene locus, change in LDL-C and risk of CAD.
CONCLUSION: A common variant at the LDLR gene locus affects LDL-C levels and, thereby, the risk for CAD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies in older subjects have shown no or inverse associations between cholesterol levels and mortality. However, in old age plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) may not reflect the lifetime level due to reverse causality, and hence the risk may be underestimated. In the current study, we used an LDL genetic risk score (GRS) to overcome this problem.
METHODS: A weighted GRS was created using 51 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with LDL-C levels. The LDL GRS was calculated in three Dutch cohorts: the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) (n = 3270), the Leiden 85-plus study (n = 316) and the Rotterdam Study (n = 4035). We assessed the association between the LDL GRS and LDL-C levels, chronological age, familial longevity and mortality.
RESULTS: Up to 90 years of age, in each age stratum individuals with high LDL GRS had higher LDL-C levels (P = 0.010 to P = 1.1 x 10(-16)). The frequency of LDL-increasing alleles decreased with increasing age [β = -0.021 (SE = 0.01) per year, P = 0.018]. Moreover, individuals with a genetic predisposition for longevity had significantly lower LDL GRS compared with age-matched individuals of the general population [LLS nonagenarians vs {\textgreater} 90 years: β = 0.73 (SE = 0.33), P = 0.029, LLS offspring vs partners: β = 0.66 (SE = 0.23), P = 0.005]. In longitudinal analysis, high GRS was associated with increased all-cause mortality in individuals {\textgreater} 90 years, with a 13\% increased risk in individuals with the highest LDL GRS (P-trend = 0.043).
CONCLUSION: Results of the current study indicate that a genetic predisposition to high LDL-C levels contributes to mortality throughout life, including in the oldest old, and a beneficial LDL genetic risk profile is associated with familial longevity.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading global cause of death, accounting for 17.3 million deaths per year. Preventive treatment that reduces CVD by even a small percentage can substantially reduce, nationally and globally, the number of people who develop CVD and the costs of caring for them. This American Heart Association presidential advisory on dietary fats and CVD reviews and discusses the scientific evidence, including the most recent studies, on the effects of dietary saturated fat intake and its replacement by other types of fats and carbohydrates on CVD. In summary, randomized controlled trials that lowered intake of dietary saturated fat and replaced it with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced CVD by â‰ˆ30\%, similar to the reduction achieved by statin treatment. Prospective observational studies in many populations showed that lower intake of saturated fat coupled with higher intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat is associated with lower rates of CVD and of other major causes of death and all-cause mortality. In contrast, replacement of saturated fat with mostly refined carbohydrates and sugars is not associated with lower rates of CVD and did not reduce CVD in clinical trials. Replacement of saturated with unsaturated fats lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a cause of atherosclerosis, linking biological evidence with incidence of CVD in populations and in clinical trials. Taking into consideration the totality of the scientific evidence, satisfying rigorous criteria for causality, we conclude strongly that lowering intake of saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fats, especially polyunsaturated fats, will lower the incidence of CVD. This recommended shift from saturated to unsaturated fats should occur simultaneously in an overall healthful dietary pattern such as DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) or the Mediterranean diet as emphasized by the 2013 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology lifestyle guidelines and the 2015 to 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.},

Diabetic dyslipidemia is suggested to be an additional important contributor to CVD risk in T2DM. Multiple lipid lowering medications effectively reduce fasting LDL cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations and several of them routinely reduce CVD risk. However, in contemporary Western societies the vasculature is commonly exposed to prolonged postprandial hyperlipidemia. Metabolism of these postprandial carbohydrates and lipids yields multiple proatherogenic products. Even a transient increase in these factors may worsen vascular function and induces impaired endothelial dependent vasodilatation, a predictor of atherosclerosis and future cardiovascular events. There is a recent increased appreciation for the role of gut-derived incretin hormones in controlling the postprandial metabolic milieu. Incretin-based medications have been developed and are now used to control postprandial hyperglycemia in T2DM. Recent data indicate that these medications may also have profound effects on postprandial lipid metabolism and may favorably influence several cardiovascular functions. This review discusses (1) the postprandial state with special emphasis on postprandial lipid metabolism and its role in endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk, (2) the ability of incretins to modulate postprandial hyperlipidemia and (3) the potential of incretin-based therapeutic strategies to improve vascular function and reduce CVD risk.},

However, the relationship between LDL-c/HDL-c ratio and the risk of SCD has not been previously investigated. We aimed to assess the associations of LDL-c, HDL-c, and the ratio of LDL-c/HDL-c with the risk of SCD., Methods: Serum lipoprotein concentrations were assessed at baseline in the Finnish Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease prospective cohort study of 2,616 men aged 42–61 years at recruitment. Hazard ratios (HRs) (95\% confidence intervals [CI]) were assessed., Results: During a median follow-up of 23.0 years, a total of 228 SCDs occurred. There was no significant evidence of an association of LDL-c or HDL-c with the risk of SCD. In analyses adjusted for age, examination year, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, years of education, diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, family history of coronary heart disease, and serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein, there was approximately a two-fold increase in the risk of SCD (HR 1.94, 95\% CI 1.21–3.11; p = 0.006), comparing the top ({\textgreater} 4.22) versus bottom (≤ 2.30) quintile of serum LDL-c/HDL-c ratio., Conclusion: In this middle-aged male population, LDL-c or HDL-c was not associated with the risk of SCD. However, a high serum LDL-c/HDL-c ratio was found to be independently associated with an increased risk of SCD.

High low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol is a recognized pathogenic factor for atherosclerosis, and its complications and statins represent the most potent and widely used therapeutic approach to prevent and control these disorders. Recent Advances: A number of clinical and experimental studies concur to identify endothelial dysfunction as a primary step in the development of atherosclerosis, as well as a risk factor for subsequent clinical events. Oxidant stress resulting from chronic elevation of plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-chol) is a major contributor to both endothelial dysfunction and its complications, for example, through alterations of endothelial nitric oxide signaling. Critical Issues: Statin treatment reduces morbidity and mortality of CVD, but increasing evidence questions that this is exclusively through reduction of plasma LDL-chol. The identification of ancillary effects on (cardio)vascular biology, for example, through their modulation of oxidative stress, will not only increase our understanding of their mechanisms of action, with a potential broadening of their indication(s), but also lead to the identification of new molecular targets for future therapeutic developments in CVD. Future Directions: Further characterization of molecular pathways targeted by statins, for example, not directly mediated by changes in plasma lipid concentrations, should enable a more comprehensive approach to the pathogenesis of (cardio)vascular disease, including, for example, epigenetic regulation and fine tuning of cell metabolism.

	abstract = {Objectives
The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that elevated nonfasting remnant cholesterol is a causal risk factor for ischemic heart disease independent of reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.
Background
Elevated remnant cholesterol is associated with elevated levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and with reduced HDL cholesterol, and all are associated with ischemic heart disease.
Methods
A total of 73,513 subjects from Copenhagen were genotyped, of whom 11,984 had ischemic heart disease diagnosed between 1976 and 2010. Fifteen genetic variants were selected, affecting: 1) nonfasting remnant cholesterol alone; 2) nonfasting remnant cholesterol and HDL cholesterol combined; 3) HDL cholesterol alone; or 4) low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol alone as a positive control. The variants were used in a Mendelian randomization design.
Results
The causal odds ratio for a 1 mmol/l (39 mg/dl) genetic increase of nonfasting remnant cholesterol was 2.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9 to 4.2), with a corresponding observational hazard ratio of 1.4 (95\% CI: 1.3 to 1.5). For the ratio of nonfasting remnant cholesterol to HDL cholesterol, corresponding values were 2.9 (95\% CI: 1.9 to 4.6) causal and 1.2 (95\% CI 1.2 to 1.3) observational for a 1-U increase. However, for HDL cholesterol, corresponding values were 0.7 (95\% CI: 0.4 to 1.4) causal and 1.6 (95\% CI: 1.4 to 1.7) observational for a 1 mmol/l (39 mg/dl) decrease. Finally, for LDL cholesterol, corresponding values were 1.5 (95\% CI: 1.3 to 1.6) causal and 1.1 (95\% CI: 1.1 to 1.2) observational for a 1 mmol/l (39 mg/dl) increase.
Conclusions
A nonfasting remnant cholesterol increase of 1 mmol/l (39 mg/dl) is associated with a 2.8-fold causal risk for ischemic heart disease, independent of reduced HDL cholesterol. This implies that elevated cholesterol content of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles causes ischemic heart disease. However, because pleiotropic effects of the genetic variants studied cannot be totally excluded, these findings need to be confirmed using additional genetic variants and/or randomized intervention trials.},

Epidemiological studies show that HDL-cholesterol levels are inversely correlated with the risk of cardiovascular events. However, many patients who experience a clinical event have normal, or even high, levels of HDL cholesterol. Measuring HDL-cholesterol levels provides information about the size of the HDL pool, but does not predict HDL composition or function. The main component of HDL, apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), is largely responsible for reverse cholesterol transport through the macrophage ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1. Apo A-I can be damaged by oxidative mechanisms, which render the protein less able to promote cholesterol efflux. HDL also contains a number of other proteins that are affected by the oxidative environment of the acute-phase response. Modification of the protein components of HDL can convert it from an anti-inflammatory to a proinflammatory particle. Small peptides that mimic some of the properties of apo A-I have been shown in preclinical models to improve HDL function and reduce atherosclerosis without altering HDL-cholesterol levels. Robust assays to evaluate the function of HDL are needed to supplement the measurement of HDL-cholesterol levels in the clinic.},

We compared 4 cardiovascular health metrics (current smoking, body mass index, blood pressure, and diabetic status) between Army and civilian groups overall, and separately by sex, race/ethnicity, and age. The Army population was younger, was less often women or Hispanic, and had less post–high school education than the NHANES population. Smoking rates were ≈20\% in the Army and NHANES groups, but {\textless}15\% among Army women and Hispanics. Overall, one third of the Army and NHANES groups and NHANES women, but nearly half of Army women, demonstrated ideal body mass index. Ideal blood pressure was strikingly less prevalent in the Army than NHANES participants (30\% versus 55\%). Diabetes mellitus was rare in both groups.ConclusionsIdeal cardiovascular health was less prevalent in the Army than NHANES group, despite exclusion of the least healthy recruits. Prevalence of ideal body mass index and blood pressure was low in both the Army and NHANES groups, even at early adult ages. This finding reveals the need for policy changes to promote, preserve, and improve ideal cardiovascular health in both the Army and the US population as a whole.},

neither substantially change with advances in chemotherapy, radiotherapy and molecular profiling. Ketogenic diets have been suggested as a promising alternative therapy. However, group studies in cancer patients with the classical ketogenic diet so far provided little or no evidence that the classical ketogenic diet is indeed beneficial in terms of prolonging survival.
Results: Here we present three cases: one patient with grade 3 brain tumor, (pat \#1: anaplastic oligodendroglioma) and two patients with grade 4 brain tumor (pat \#2: recurrent glioblastoma; pat \#3: new-onset glioblastoma). The three patients were started on the strickest form of the paleolithic ketogenic diet (PKD): the full meat-fat diet. At the time of diet onset all three patients refused chemotherapy and radiotherapy and did neither use any dietary supplements nor standard medications. They all strictly adhered to the diet and were in constant ketosis. Pat \#1, who was overweight at diet onset, lost 25 kg on the diet during the first nine months of the diet. During this time tumor size was relatively stable. Later on tumor size gradually increased which was preceded by a gradual increase in food intake without affecting ketosis. Along with this inflammatory parameters increased as well. The patient was advised to decrease food intake and subsequently inflammatory parameters decreased again. In pat \#2, in addition to recurrent glioblastoma, past history also included bladder cancer. Despite surgery and radiochemotherapy his brain tumor recurred. Upon recurrence, the patient stopped radiochemotherapy and started the PKD as a stand-alone therapy. Currently, the patient is on the diet for 14 months and is progression-free. Pat \#3 had a stable tumor size for the first two months of the diet when he used the diet as a stand-alone therapy. Then, despite being progression-free and having no sympoms at all, the patient decided to have radiotherapy. Although we advised against, he also started taking multiple supplements and began hyperbaric oxigen therapy. From this time on his disease progressed and the patient died at 11 months.
Conclusions: The two patients using the PKD as a stand-alone therapy are still alive at 25 and 14 months while the third patient after starting additional therapies experienced progression and died.},

Unlike fish-sourced oils, the bioavailability of DHA from vegetarian-sourced (algal) oils has not been formally assessed. We assessed bioequivalence of DHA oils in capsules from two different algal strains versus bioavailability from an algal-DHA-fortified food. Our 28-day randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study compared bioavailability of (a) two different algal DHA oils in capsules ("DHASCO-T" and "DHASCO-S") at doses of 200, 600, and 1,000 mg DHA per day (n = 12 per group) and of (b) an algal-DHA-fortified food (n = 12). Bioequivalence was based on changes in plasma phospholipid and erythrocyte DHA levels. Effects on arachidonic acid (ARA), docosapentaenoic acid-n-6 (DPAn-6), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were also determined. Both DHASCO-T and DHASCO-S capsules produced equivalent DHA levels in plasma phospholipids and erythrocytes. DHA response was dose-dependent and linear over the dose range, plasma phospholipid DHA increased by 1.17, 2.28 and 3.03 g per 100 g fatty acid at 200, 600, and 1,000 mg dose, respectively. Snack bars fortified with DHASCO-S oil also delivered equivalent amounts of DHA on a DHA dose basis. Adverse event monitoring revealed an excellent safety and tolerability profile. Two different algal oil capsule supplements and an algal oil-fortified food represent bioequivalent and safe sources of DHA.},

There is much epidemiological evidence for disease prevention by dietary antioxidants and chemical evidence that such compounds react in one-electron reactions with free radicals in vitro. Nonetheless, kinetic constraints indicate that in vivo scavenging of radicals is ineffective in antioxidant defense. Instead, enzymatic removal of non-radical electrophiles, such as hydroperoxides, in two-electron redox reactions is the major antioxidant mechanism. Furthermore, we propose that a major mechanism of action for nutritional antioxidants is the paradoxical oxidative activation of the Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) signaling pathway, which maintains protective oxidoreductases and their nucleophilic substrates. This maintenance of ‘Nucleophilic Tone,’ by a mechanism that can be called ‘Para-Hormesis,’ provides a means for regulating physiological non-toxic concentrations of the non-radical oxidant electrophiles that boost antioxidant enzymes, and damage removal and repair systems (for proteins, lipids, and DNA), at the optimal levels consistent with good health.},

We performed population genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the CHC22-encoding CLTCL1 gene, revealing independent gene loss in at least two vertebrate lineages, after arising from gene duplication. All vertebrates retained the paralogous CLTC gene encoding CHC17 clathrin, which mediates endocytosis. For vertebrates retaining CLTCL1, strong evidence for purifying selection supports CHC22 functionality. All human populations maintained two high frequency CLTCL1 allelic variants, encoding either methionine or valine at position 1316. Functional studies indicated that CHC22-V1316, which is more frequent in farming populations than in hunter-gatherers, has different cellular dynamics than M1316-CHC22 and is less effective at controlling GLUT4 membrane traffic, altering its insulin-regulated response. These analyses suggest that ancestral human dietary change influenced selection of allotypes that affect CHC22’s role in metabolism and have potential to differentially influence the human insulin response.},

We used genetic variants as instruments to test the causal associations. Genetically predicted higher TMAO and carnitine were not associated with higher odds of T2DM, AF, CAD, MI, stroke, and CKD after Bonferroni correction (P≤0.0005). However, we observed that genetically increased choline showed a suggestive association with higher risk of T2DM (odds ratio: 1.84, 95\% confidence interval: 1.00 to 3.42 per 10 units, P=0.05). In contrast, genetically predicted higher betaine (0.68, 0.48 to 0.95 per 10 units, P=0.023) was suggestively associated with a lower risk of T2DM. We observed a suggestive association of genetically increased choline with a lower level of body fat \% (beta: -0.28, SE: 0.11, P=0.013), but a higher level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (0.10±0.05, P=0.034).

METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: PubMed and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2017 for eligible studies. Nineteen prospective cohort or cross-sectional studies with adequate sample sizes are included, all involving red meat, seafoods, alcohol, fructose, dairy products, soy foods, high-purine vegetables and coffee.
RESULTS: Meta-analysis revealed several dietary associations with gout risk: red meat: OR 1.29 (95\% CI 1.16-1.44); seafoods: OR 1.31 (95\% CI 1.01-1.68); alcohol: OR 2.58 (95\% CI 1.81-3.66); fructose: OR 2.14 (95\% CI 1.65- 2.78); dairy products: OR 0.56 (95\% CI 0.44-0.70); soy foods: OR 0.85 (95\% CI 0.76-0.96); high-purine vegetables: OR 0.86 (95\% CI 0.75-0.98); coffee: OR 0.47 (95\% CI 0.37-0.59).Dietary association with hyperuricemia risk (red meat: OR 1.24 (95\% CI 1.04-1.48); seafoods: OR 1.47 (95\% CI 1.16-1.86); alcohol: OR 2.06 (95\% CI 1.60-2.67); fructose: OR 1.85 (95\% CI 1.66-2.07); dairy products: OR 0.50 (95\% CI 0.37-0.66); soy foods: OR 0.70 (95\% CI 0.56-0.88); high-purine vegetables ingestion: OR 1.10 (95\% CI 0.88-1.39), P=0.39; coffee:OR0.76 in men (95\% CI 0.55-1.06), OR 1.58 in women (95\% CI 1.16-2.16).
CONCLUSION: The risk of hyperuricemia and gout is positively correlated with the intake of red meat, seafoods, alcohol or fructose, and negatively with dairy products or soy foods. High-purine vegetables showed no association with hyperuricemia, but negative association with gout. Coffee intake is negatively associated with gout risk, whereas it may be associated with increased hyperuricemia risk in women but decreased risk in men.},

Each diet contained 20\% of fat by weight, with varying amounts of coconut oil and corn oil added to achieve the desired levels of linoleate. Mammary tumorigenesis was very sensitive to linoleate intake and increased proportionately in the range of 0.5 to 4.4\% of dietary linoleate. Regression analysis indicated that a breakpoint occurred at 4.4\%, beyond which there was a very poor linear relationship, suggesting the possibility of a plateau. From the intersection of the regression lines in both the upper and lower ranges, the level of linoleate required to elicit the maximal tumorigenic response was estimated to be around 4\%. The differences in tumor yield could not be correlated with changes in prostaglandin E concentration in the mammary fat pads of normal animals maintained on similar diets, suggesting that linoleate may act by some other mechanism to stimulate mammary tumorigenesis.},

Stearate has been shown to have anti-cancer properties during early stages of neoplastic progression.

In this study, we present evidence that exogenously supplied dietary stearate dramatically reduces the size of tumors that formed from injected human breast cancer cells within the mammary fat pads of athymic nude mice by approximately 50\% and partially inhibits breast cancer cell metastasis burden in the lungs in this mouse model system. This metastatic inhibition appears to be independent of primary tumor size, as stearate fed animals that had primary tumors comparable in size to littermates fed either a safflower oil enriched diet or a low fat diet had reduced lung metastasis. Also stearate fed mice sub-groups had different primary tumor sizes but no difference in metastasis. This anti-metastasis effect may be due, at least in part, to the ability of stearate to induce apoptosis in these human breast cancer cells. Overall, this study suggests the possibility of dietary manipulation with selected long-chain saturated fatty acids such as stearate as a potential adjuvant therapeutic strategy for breast cancer patients wishing to maximize the suppression of metastatic disease.},

Aging is the strongest risk factor for most forms of cancer, however, little is known regarding the mechanisms involved. Dietary methionine restriction (MR) has been found to delay the aging process and enhance longevity up to 40\% in rats without restriction in energy intake. In addition, MR inhibits numerous key factors involved in the metabolic decline of aging characterized by changes in fat distribution, obesity and insulin resistance. Recent studies have provided compelling evidence linking obesity and insulin resistance with enhanced susceptibility to cancer at many sites with key fat-derived cytokines (adipocytokines) playing an important role. We hypothesize that MR inhibits aging/insulin resistance-related changes in adipocytokine production and reduces the risk for cancer development. To test this, male F344 rats were fed control (CF, 0.86\% Met) or experimental (MR, 0.17\% Met) diets beginning at 6 weeks of age until sacrifice at approximately 30 months of age. Histopathologic analyses were performed to identify the incidence and progression of common aging-related tumors. Blood was obtained and plasma levels of adipocytokines (adiponectin and leptin), glucose and insulin were determined and correlated. Testicular tumors were the most common neoplasm observed occurring in 88\% of CF animals. MR resulted in a significant reduction in testicular tumor incidence (22\% of MR rats, p{\textless}0.04) with a delay in the disease progression from the hyperplastic stage. The levels of plasma adiponectin (reduced in obese/diabetic animals and humans), were increased 3-fold in MR rats. Adiponectin levels were inversely correlated with the levels of blood glucose, insulin and leptin. These results suggest that MR may lead to metabolic and cellular changes providing protection against aging-related tumorigenesis through mechanisms that promote a lifelong insulin sensitive phenotype. Further studies to elucidate the specific mechanisms involved are currently underway. Supported in part by NIH grant CA17613.},

Sodium saccharin and DL-tryptophan were fed at levels of 5 and 2\% of the diet, respectively, as possible promoting chemicals, and they were fed either immediately after FANFT administration or after six weeks of FANFT plus six weeks of control diet. All surviving rats were killed at the end of two years. Both chemicals significantly increased the incidence of bladder tumors following FANFT feeding compared to six  weeks of FANFT feeding followed by control diet, and the results were similar whether saccharin or tryptophan feeding was started immediately after FANFT feeding was concluded or after a six-week delay. Saccharin was considerably more potent as a promoting agent than was tryptophan, inducing higher incidences of bladder tumors and having a shorter latent period. Long-term administration of FANFT induced a 100\% incidence of bladder cancer. Sequential epithelial changes were observed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy as well as by light microscopy. Pleomorphic microvilli were present on the superficial cells of all tumors examined and on the surface cells of hyperplastic bladder epithelium after six weeks of FANFT plus six weeks of saccharin, but not after six weeks of FANFT and six weeks of control diet. Rats fed only saccharin tryptophan, or control diet did not have bladder tumors or pleomorphic microvilli on bladder epithelium. These data suggest that saccharin and tryptophan might act as tumor-promoting agents during bladder carcinogenesis.},

Since increased cell replication is associated with the development of hepatic cancer caused by peroxisome proliferators, glycine may have anti-cancer properties. Therefore, experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that dietary glycine would inhibit the hepatocarcinogenic effect of WY-14,643. Male F344 rats were fed four different NIH 07-based diets: 5\% glycine; 5\% valine for nitrogen balance (control); 0.1\% WY-14,643 + 5\% valine (WY-14,643); 0.1\% WY-14,643 + 5\% glycine (WY-14,643 + glycine). Food consumption did not differ among the groups, but WY-14,643-fed rats weighed 10-25\% less than expected based on previous studies. Serum glycine levels were elevated 4-5-fold by glycine-containing diets; however, the 10-fold increase in peroxisomal enzyme activity caused by WY-14,643 was unaffected by the addition of 5\% glycine to the diet. After 22 weeks, livers from rats fed WY-14,643 had a similar incidence and multiplicity of proliferative lesions (foci and adenomas) to those fed WY-14,643 + glycine. Moreover, cell proliferation in the surrounding 'normal' parenchyma (labeling index approximately 4\%) and foci (labeling index approximately 50\%) did not differ between WY-14,643 and WY-14,643 + glycine-fed rats. However, after 51 weeks of dietary exposure to WY-14,643, glycine prevented formation of small (0-5 mm diameter) tumors by 23\% and inhibited the development of medium size (5-10 mm) tumors by 64\%. Furthermore, glycine prevented the formation of the largest tumors ({\textgreater}10 mm) by nearly 80\%. Thus, glycine did not inhibit early foci formation; however, it significantly decreased their ability to progress to tumors. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of glycine was greater with increasing tumor size. These studies demonstrate that dietary glycine prevents the development of hepatic tumors caused by the peroxisome proliferator WY-14,643 consistent with the idea that it may be an effective chemopreventive agent.},

Fifteen C3H-MTV+ weanlings were given a low-iron diet (5 mg iron/kg diet), and 15 were given diets with normal amounts of iron (180 mg Fe/kg diet). Thirteen of the 15 mice from the low-iron group and all 15 mice from the normal-iron group developed tumors. The average tumor growth rate in the normal-iron group was 112\%/wk, compared with 62\%/wk for the low-iron group. The difference in tumor growth rate between the two groups was significant (P = 0.02 by Student's t test). In this study, low iron intake did not prevent tumor development, but the results confirm the authors' previous report that iron nutrition of the host affects tumor growth; tumors grow better in an iron-rich environment. High levels of iron in the diet may enhance tumor growth, and this should be considered when treating patients with cancer.},

The concentration at which cell proliferation was inhibited by 50\% (IC50), based on incorporation of [3H]thymidine, varied from 5.9 to 140 micrograms/ml for the single flavonoids, with the most potent being baicalein. IC50 values for the one-to-one combinations ranged from 4.7 micrograms/ml (quercetin + hesperetin, quercetin + naringenin) to 22.5 micrograms/ml (naringenin + hesperetin). All the flavonoids showed low cytotoxicity ({\textgreater} 500 micrograms/ml for 50\% cell death). Naringenin is present in grapefruit mainly as its glycosylated form, naringin. These compounds, as well as grapefruit and orange juice concentrates, were tested for their ability to inhibit development of mammary tumors induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Two experiments were conducted in which groups of 21 rats were fed a semipurified diet containing 5\% corn oil and were given a 5-mg dose of DMBA intragastrically at approximately 50 days of age while in diestrus. One week later, individual groups were given double-strength grapefruit juice or orange juice or fed naringin or naringenin at levels comparable to that provided by the grapefruit juice; in the second experiment, the rats were fed a semipurified diet containing 20\% corn oil at that time. As expected, rats fed the high-fat diet developed more tumors than rats fed the low-fat diet, but in both experiments tumor development was delayed in the groups given orange juice or fed the naringin-supplemented diet compared with the other three groups. Although tumor incidence and tumor burden (grams of tumor/rat) were somewhat variable in the different groups, rats given orange juice had a smaller tumor burden than controls, although they grew better than any of the other groups. These experiments provide evidence of anticancer properties of orange juice and indicate that citrus flavonoids are effective inhibitors of human breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro, especially when paired with quercetin, which is widely distributed in other foods.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Studies on long-term sustainability of low-carbohydrate approaches to treat diabetes are limited. We previously reported the effectiveness of a novel digitally-monitored continuous care intervention (CCI) including nutritional ketosis in improving weight, glycemic outcomes, lipid, and liver marker changes at 1 year. Here, we assess the effects of the CCI at 2 years. Materials and methods: An open label, non-randomized, controlled study with 262 and 87 participants with T2D were enrolled in the CCI and usual care (UC) groups, respectively. Primary outcomes were retention, glycemic control, and weight changes at 2 years. Secondary outcomes included changes in body composition, liver, cardiovascular, kidney, thyroid and inflammatory markers; diabetes medication use and disease status. Results: Significant changes from baseline to 2 years in the CCI group included: HbA1c (-12\% from 7.7±0.1\%); fasting glucose (-18\% from 163.7±3.9 mg/dL); fasting insulin (-42\% from 27.7±1.3 mIU L-1); weight (-10\% from 114.56±0.60 kg); systolic blood pressure (-4\% from 131.7±0.9 mmHg); diastolic blood pressure (-4\% from 81.8±0.5 mmHg); triglycerides (-22\% from 197.2±9.1 mg/dL); HDL-C (+19\% from 41.8±0.9 mg/dL), and liver alanine transaminase (-21\% from 29.16±0.97 U/L). Spine bone mineral density in the CCI group was unchanged. Glycemic control medication use (excluding metformin) among CCI participants declined (from 55.7\% to 26.8\%, P=1.3x10-11) including prescribed insulin (-62\%) and sulfonylureas (-100\%). The UC group had no significant changes in these parameters (except uric acid and anion gap) or diabetes medication use. There was also significant resolution of diabetes (reversal, 53.5\%; remission, 17.6\%) in the CCI group but not in UC. All the reported improvements had p-values {\textless}0.00012. Conclusion: The CCI group sustained long-term beneficial effects on multiple clinical markers of diabetes and cardiometabolic health at 2 years while utilizing less medication. The intervention was also effective in the resolution of diabetes and visceral obesity with no adverse effect on bone health.},

	abstract = {Ketone bodies are the most energy-efficient fuel and yield more ATP per mole of substrate than pyruvate and increase the free energy released from ATP hydrolysis. Elevation of circulating ketones via high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets has been used for the treatment of drug-refractory epilepsy and for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Ketones may also be beneficial for muscle and brain in times of stress, such as endurance exercise. The challenge has been to raise circulating ketone levels by using a palatable diet without altering lipid levels. We found that blood ketone levels can be increased and cholesterol and triglycerides decreased by feeding rats a novel ketone ester diet: chow that is supplemented with (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate as 30\% of calories. For 5 d, rats on the ketone diet ran 32\% further on a treadmill than did control rats that ate an isocaloric diet that was supplemented with either corn starch or palm oil (P {\textless} 0.05). Ketone-fed rats completed an 8-arm radial maze test 38\% faster than did those on the other diets, making more correct decisions before making a mistake (P {\textless} 0.05). Isolated, perfused hearts from rats that were fed the ketone diet had greater free energy available from ATP hydrolysis during increased work than did hearts from rats on the other diets as shown by using [31P]-NMR spectroscopy. The novel ketone diet, therefore, improved physical performance and cognitive function in rats, and its energy-sparing properties suggest that it may help to treat a range of human conditions with metabolic abnormalities.-Murray, A.

	abstract = {The goal of this review was to assess the effectiveness of ketogenic diets on the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. The ketogenic diet is a low-carbohydrate and fat-rich diet. Its implementation has a fasting-like effect, which brings the body into a state of ketosis. The ketogenic diet has, for almost 100 years, been used in the therapy of drug-resistant epilepsy, but current studies indicate possible neuroprotective effects. Thus far, only a few studies have evaluated the role of the ketogenic diet in the prevention of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Single studies with human participants have demonstrated a reduction of disease symptoms after application. The application of the ketogenic diet to elderly people, however, raises certain concerns. Persons with neurodegenerative diseases are at risk of malnutrition, while food intake reduction is associated with disease symptoms. In turn, the ketogenic diet leads to a reduced appetite; it is not attractive from an organoleptic point of view, and may be accompanied by side effects of the gastrointestinal system. All this may lead to further lowering of consumed food portions by elderly persons with neurodegenerative diseases and, in consequence, to further reduction in the supply of nutrients provided by the diet. Neither data on the long-term application of the ketogenic diet in patients with neurodegenerative disease or data on its effects on disease symptoms are available. Further research is needed to evaluate the suitability of the ketogenic diet in the therapy of AD- or PD-affected persons.},

A low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet reduces body mass without compromising performance in powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting athletes. J Strength Cond Res 32(12): 3382-3391, 2018-Weight class athletes use weight-making strategies to compete in specific weight categories with an optimum power-to-weight ratio. There is evidence that low carbohydrate diets might offer specific advantages for weight reduction without the negative impact on strength and power previously hypothesized to accompany carbohydrate restriction. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) could be used as a weight reduction strategy for athletes competing in the weight class sports of powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting. Fourteen intermediate to elite competitive lifting athletes (age 34 ± 10.5, n = 5 female) consumed an ad libitum usual diet (UD) ({\textgreater}250 g daily intake of carbohydrates) and an ad libitum LCKD (≤50 g or ≤10\% daily intake of carbohydrates) in random order, each for 3 months in a crossover design. Lifting performance, body composition, resting metabolic rate, blood glucose, and blood electrolytes were measured at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The LCKD phase resulted in significantly lower body mass (-3.26 kg, p = 0.038) and lean mass (-2.26 kg, p = 0.016) compared with the UD phase. Lean mass losses were not reflected in lifting performances that were not different between dietary phases. No other differences in primary or secondary outcome measures were found between dietary phases. Weight class athletes consuming an ad libitum LCKD decreased body mass and achieved lifting performances that were comparable with their UD. Coaches and athletes should consider using an LCKD to achieve targeted weight reduction goals for weight class sports.},

Although it is strongly regulated by many extracellular factors, induction of autophagy is mainly produced by starvation of nutrients. In mammalian cells, the regulation of autophagy by amino acids, and also by the hormone insulin, has been extensively investigated, but knowledge about the effects of other autophagy regulators, including another nutrient, glucose, is more limited. Here we will focus on the signalling pathways by which environmental glucose directly, i.e., independently of insulin and glucagon, regulates autophagy in mammalian cells, but we will also briefly mention some data in yeast. Although glucose deprivation mainly induces autophagy via AMPK activation and the subsequent inhibition of mTORC1, we will also comment other signalling pathways, as well as evidences indicating that, under certain conditions, autophagy can be activated by glucose. A better understanding on how glucose regulates autophagy not only will expand our basic knowledge of this important cell process, but it will be also relevant to understand common human disorders, such as cancer and diabetes, in which glucose levels play an important role.},

Despite the constant recommendations of health care organizations regarding the importance of weight control, this goal often fails. Genetic predisposition in combination with inactive lifestyles and high caloric intake leads to excessive weight gain. Even though there may be agreement about the concept that lifestyle changes affecting dietary habits and physical activity are essential to promote weight loss and weight control, the ideal amount and type of exercise and also the ideal diet are still under debate. For many years, nutritional intervention studies have been focused on reducing dietary fat with little positive results over the long-term.  One of the most studied strategies in the recent years for weight loss is the ketogenic diet. Many studies have shown that this kind of nutritional approach has a solid physiological and biochemical basis and is able to induce effective weight loss along with improvement in several cardiovascular risk parameters. This review discusses the physiological basis of ketogenic diets and the rationale for their use in obesity, discussing the strengths and the weaknesses of these diets together with cautions that should be used in obese patients.},

The two main ketone bodies are acetoacetate (AcAc) and 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (3HB), while acetone is the third, and least abundant, ketone body. Ketones are always present in the blood and their levels increase during fasting and prolonged exercise. They are also found in the blood of neonates and pregnant women. Diabetes is the most common pathological cause of elevated blood ketones. In diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), high levels of ketones are produced in response to low insulin levels and high levels of counterregulatory hormones. In acute DKA, the ketone body ratio (3HB:AcAc) rises from normal (1:1) to as high as 10:1. In response to insulin therapy, 3HB levels commonly decrease long before AcAc levels. The frequently employed nitroprusside test only detects AcAc in blood and urine. This test is inconvenient, does not assess the best indicator of ketone body levels (3HB), provides only a semiquantitative assessment of ketone levels and is associated with false-positive results. Recently, inexpensive quantitative tests of 3HB levels have become available for use with small blood samples (5-25 microl). These tests offer new options for monitoring and treating diabetes and other states characterized by the abnormal metabolism of ketone bodies.},

Recently, there has been a re-emerging interest in the role of ketone bodies in exercise metabolism, with considerable media speculation about ketone body supplements being routinely used by professional cyclists. Ketone bodies can serve as an important energy substrate under certain conditions, such as starvation, and can modulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Dietary strategies to increase endogenous ketone body availability (i.e., a ketogenic diet) require a diet high in lipids and low in carbohydrates for {\textasciitilde}4 days to induce nutritional ketosis. However, a high fat, low carbohydrate ketogenic diet may impair exercise performance via reducing the capacity to utilize carbohydrate, which forms a key fuel source for skeletal muscle during intense endurance-type exercise. Recently, ketone body supplements (ketone salts and esters) have emerged and may be used to rapidly increase ketone body availability, without the need to first adapt to a ketogenic diet. However, the extent to which ketone bodies regulate skeletal muscle bioenergetics and substrate metabolism during prolonged endurance-type exercise of varying intensity and duration remains unknown. Therefore, at present there are no data available to suggest that ingestion of ketone bodies during exercise improves athletes’ performance under conditions where evidence-based nutritional strategies are applied appropriately.},

Here we hypothesized that chronic heavy drinking facilitates this energy substrate shift both for baseline and stimulation conditions. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of alcohol intoxication (0.75 g/kg alcohol vs placebo) on brain glucose metabolism during video stimulation (VS) versus when given with no stimulation (NS), in 25 heavy drinkers (HDs) and 23 healthy controls, each of whom underwent four PET-18FDG scans. We showed that resting whole-brain glucose metabolism (placebo-NS) was lower in HD than controls (13\%, p = 0.04); that alcohol (compared with placebo) decreased metabolism more in HD (20 ± 13\%) than controls (9 ± 11\%, p = 0.005) and in proportion to daily alcohol consumption (r = 0.36, p = 0.01) but found that alcohol did not reduce the metabolic increases in visual cortex from VS in either group. Instead, VS reduced alcohol-induced decreases in whole-brain glucose metabolism (10 ± 12\%) compared with NS in both groups (15 ± 13\%, p = 0.04), consistent with stimulation-related glucose metabolism enhancement. These findings corroborate our hypothesis that heavy alcohol consumption facilitates use of alternative energy substrates (i.e., acetate) for resting activity during intoxication, which might persist through early sobriety, but indicate that glucose is still favored as energy substrate during brain stimulation. Our findings are consistent with reduced reliance on glucose as the main energy substrate for resting brain metabolism during intoxication (presumably shifting to acetate or other ketones) and a priming of this shift in HDs, which might make them vulnerable to energy deficits during withdrawal.},

	abstract = {Objective
High fat, low carbohydrate (HFLC) diets have become popular tools for weight management. We sought to determine the effects of a HFLC diet compared to a low fat high carbohydrate (LFHC) diet on the change in weight loss, cardiovascular risk factors and inflammation in subjects with obesity.

Methods
Obese subjects (29.0–44.6 kg/m2) recruited from Boston Medical Center were randomized to a hypocaloric LFHC (n=26) or HFLC (n=29) diet for 12 weeks.

Results
The age range of subjects was 21–62 years. As a percentage of daily calories, the HFLC group consumed 33.5\% protein, 56.0\% fat and 9.6\% carbohydrate and the LFHC group consumed 22.0\% protein, 25.0\% fat and 55.7\% carbohydrate. The change in percent body weight, lean and fat mass, blood pressure, flow mediated dilation, hip:waist ratio, hemoglobin A1C, fasting insulin and glucose, and glucose and insulin response to a 2 h oral glucose tolerance test did not differ (P{\textgreater}0.05) between diets after 12 weeks. The HFLC group had greater mean decreases in serum triglyceride (P=0.07), and hs-CRP (P=0.03), and greater mean increases in HDL cholesterol (P=0.004), and total adiponectin (P=0.045) relative to the LFHC. Secreted adipose tissue adiponectin or TNF-α did not differ after weight loss for either diet.

Conclusions
Relative to the LFHC group, the HFLC group had greater improvements in blood lipids and systemic inflammation with similar changes in body weight and composition. This small-scale study suggests that HFLC diets may be more beneficial to cardiovascular health and inflammation in free-living obese adults compared to LFHC diets.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review
The association between obesity and insulin resistance is an area of much interest and enormous public health impact, with hundreds of articles being published in the last year focused on the possible mechanisms that underlie this association. The purpose to this review is to highlight some of the key recent literature with emphasis on emerging concepts.

Recent findings
The specific link between visceral adipose tissue accumulation and insulin resistance continues to be discerned. Visceral adiposity is correlated with accumulation of excess lipid in liver, and results in cell autonomous impairment in insulin signaling. Visceral adipose tissue is also prone to inflammation and inflammatory cytokine production, which also contribute to impairment in insulin signaling. The expansion of visceral adipose tissue and excess lipid accumulation in liver and muscle may result from limited expandability of subcutaneous adipose tissue, due to the properties of its extracellular matrix and capacity for capillary growth.

Summary
Recent studies underscore the need to better understand the mechanisms linking visceral adiposity with liver fat accumulation, the mechanisms by which ectopic fat accumulation cause insulin resistance, and the mechanisms by which the size of adipose tissue depots is determined.},

	abstract = {Context:
Consumption of high-fructose diets promotes hepatic fatty acid synthesis (de novo lipogenesis [DNL]) and an atherogenic lipid profile. It is unclear whether these effects occur independent of positive energy balance and weight gain.

Objectives:
We compared the effects of a high-fructose, (25\% of energy content) weight-maintaining diet to those of an isocaloric diet with the same macronutrient distribution but in which complex carbohydrate (CCHO) was substituted for fructose.

Design, Setting, and Participants:
Eight healthy men were studied as inpatients for consecutive 9-day periods. Stable isotope tracers were used to measure fractional hepatic DNL and endogenous glucose production (EGP) and its suppression during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Liver fat was measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Results:
Weight remained stable. Regardless of the order in which the diets were fed, the high-fructose diet was associated with both higher DNL (average, 18.6 ± 1.4\% vs 11.0 ± 1.4\% for CCHO; P = .001) and higher liver fat (median, +137\% of CCHO; P = .016) in all participants. Fasting EGP and insulin-mediated glucose disposal did not differ significantly, but EGP during hyperinsulinemia was greater (0.60 ± 0.07 vs 0.46 ± 0.06 mg/kg/min; P = .013) with the high-fructose diet, suggesting blunted suppression of EGP.

Conclusion:
Short-term high-fructose intake was associated with increased DNL and liver fat in healthy men fed weight-maintaining diets.},

	abstract = {The percentage of energy from fat in diets has been thought to be an important determinant of body fat, and several mechanisms have been proposed. Comparisons of diets and the prevalence of obesity between affluent and poor countries have been used to support this relationship, but these contrasts are seriously confounded by differences in physical activity and food availability. Within areas of similar economic development, regional intake of fat and prevalence of obesity have not been positively correlated. Randomized trials are the preferable method to evaluate the effect of dietary fat on adiposity and are feasible because the number of subjects needed is not large. In short-term trials, a modest reduction in body weight is typically seen in individuals randomized to diets with a lower percentage of calories from fat. However, compensatory mechanisms appear to operate, because in randomized trials lasting ≥1 year, fat consumption within the range of 18\% to 40\% of energy appears to have little if any effect on body fatness. The weighted mean difference was −0.25 kg overall and +1.8 kg (i.e., less weight loss on the low-fat diets) for trials with a control group that received a comparable intensity intervention. Moreover, within the United States, a substantial decline in the percentage of energy from fat during the last 2 decades has corresponded with a massive increase in the prevalence of obesity. Diets high in fat do not appear to be the primary cause of the high prevalence of excess body fat in our society, and reductions in fat will not be a solution.},

The aim of this study was to explore the role of KD on liver and muscle insulin sensitivity, hepatic lipid metabolism, energy expenditure, and food intake. Using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, we studied insulin action in mice fed a KD or regular chow (RC). Body composition was assessed by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Despite being 15\% lighter (P {\textless} 0.001) than RC-fed mice because of a 17\% increase in energy expenditure (P {\textless} 0.001), KD-fed mice manifested severe hepatic insulin resistance, as reflected by decreased suppression (0\% vs. 100\% in RC-fed mice, P {\textless} 0.01) of endogenous glucose production during the clamp. Hepatic insulin resistance could be attributed to a 350\% increase in hepatic diacylglycerol content (P {\textless} 0.001), resulting in increased activation of PKCε (P {\textless} 0.05) and decreased insulin receptor substrate-2 tyrosine phosphorylation (P {\textless} 0.01). Food intake was 56\% (P {\textless} 0.001) lower in KD-fed mice, despite similar caloric intake, and could partly be attributed to a more than threefold increase (P {\textless} 0.05) in plasma N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine concentrations. In conclusion, despite preventing weight gain in mice, KD induces hepatic insulin resistance secondary to increased hepatic diacylglycerol content. Given the key role of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the development of type 2 diabetes and the widespread use of KD for the treatment of obesity, these results may have potentially important clinical implications.},

	abstract = {KEY POINTS: A ketogenic diet is known to lead to weight loss and is considered metabolically healthy; however there are conflicting reports on its effect on hepatic insulin sensitivity. KD fed animals appear metabolically healthy in the fasted state after 3Â days of dietary challenge, whereas obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) fed animals show elevated insulin levels. A glucose challenge reveals that both KD and HFD fed animals are glucose intolerant. Glucose intolerance correlates with increased lipid oxidation and lower respiratory exchange ratio (RER); however, all animals respond to glucose injection with an increase in RER. Hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps with double tracer show that the effect of KD is a result of hepatic insulin resistance and increased glucose output but not impaired glucose clearance or tissue glucose uptake in other tissues.
ABSTRACT: Despite being a relevant healthcare issue and heavily investigated, the aetiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is still incompletely understood. It is well established that increased endogenous glucose production (EGP) leads to a progressive increase in glucose levels, causing insulin resistance and eventual loss of glucose homeostasis. The consumption of high carbohydrate, high-fat, western style diet (HFD) is linked to the development of T2D and obesity, whereas the consumption of a low carbohydrate, high-fat, ketogenic diet (KD) is considered healthy. However, several days of carbohydrate restriction are known to cause selective hepatic insulin resistance. In the present study, we compare the effects of short-term HFD and KD feeding on glucose homeostasis in mice. We show that, even though KD fed animals appear to be healthy in the fasted state, they exhibit decreased glucose tolerance to a greater extent than HFD fed animals. Furthermore, we show that this effect originates from blunted suppression of hepatic glucose production by insulin, rather than impaired glucose clearance and tissue glucose uptake. These data suggest that the early effects of HFD consumption on EGP may be part of a normal physiological response to increased lipid intake and oxidation, and that systemic insulin resistance results from the addition of dietary glucose to EGP-derived glucose.},

	abstract = {Aging is associated with a progressive decrease in glucose tolerance. This decrease is associated with insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. This study was performed to evaluate the possible role of dietary factors in the glucose intolerance of aging. Two groups of men were studied: one young (Y; n = 8; age range, 18-36 yr) and one elderly (E; n = 10; age range, 65-82 yr). Frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance tests were performed in random order: 1) during ad libitum home dietary conditions; 2) after a 3- to 5-day regimen of very high (85\%) carbohydrate intake; and 3) after a 3- to 5-day regimen of low (30\%) carbohydrate intake (Y only). From the frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance test data, we calculated the glucose disappearance rate (Kg) and metabolic parameters according to the minimal model method, including the insulin sensitivity index (S1) and the first and second phase beta-cell responsivity to glucose (phi 1 and phi 2). The elderly men, while eating an ad libitum diet, were less tolerant to glucose than the young [mean Kg: E = 1.5 +/- 0.2\% (+/- SE) min-1; Y = 2.3 +/- 0.3\% min-1; P less than 0.025], had relative insulin resistance (mean Si: Y = 6.1 +/- 1.1; E = 2.4 +/- 0.7 min-1 10(-4)/(microU/mL) [0.85 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.33 +/- 0.10 min-1 10(-4)/(pmol/L)]; P less than 0.01), and lesser second phase beta-cell responsiveness to glucose (mean phi 2: Y = 18.5 +/- 3.6; E = 8.7 +/- 2.7 (microU/mL).min-2/(mg/dL) [2390 +/- 465 vs. 1120 +/- 349 (pmol/L).min-2/(mmol/L)]; P less than 0.05). A maximum improvement in Kg and S1 occurred at 41\% carbohydrate feeding in the young men, whereas in the elderly men there was a significant increase in both of these parameters while eating the very high (85\%) carbohydrate diet. Thus, the difference in glucose tolerance between groups was corrected by the very high carbohydrate diet (mean Kg: Y = 2.2 +/- 0.2\%; E = 2.0 +/- 0.3\%/min; P greater than 0.05), as was the age-related difference in insulin sensitivity (mean S1: Y = 5.6 +/- 1.2; E = 4.4 +/- 1.3 min-1 10(-4)/(microU/mL) [0.78 +/- 0.17 vs. 0.61 +/- 0.18 min-1 10(-4)/(pmol/L)]; P greater than 0.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {The prevalence of diabetes is rising dramatically among Asians, with increased consumption of the typical Western diet as one possible cause. We explored the metabolic responses in East Asian Americans (AA) and Caucasian Americans (CA) when transitioning from a traditional Asian diet (TAD) to a typical Western diet (TWD), which has not been reported before. This 16-week randomized control pilot feasibility study, included 28AA and 22CA who were at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Eight weeks of TAD were provided to all participants, followed by 8 weeks of isoenergy TWD (intervention) or TAD (control). Anthropometric measures, lipid profile, insulin resistance and inflammatory markers were assessed. While on TAD, both AA and CA improved in insulin AUC (−960.2 µU/mL×h, P = 0.001) and reduced in weight (−1.6 kg; P{\textless}0.001), body fat (−1.7\%, P{\textless}0.001) and trunk fat (−2.2\%, P{\textless}0.001). Comparing changes from TAD to TWD, AA had a smaller weight gain (−1.8 to 0.3 kg, P{\textless}0.001) than CA (−1.4 to 0.9 kg, P = 0.001), but a greater increase in insulin AUC (AA: −1402.4 to 606.2 µU/mL×h, P = 0.015 vs CA: −466.0 to 223.5 µU/mL×h, P = 0.034) and homeostatic static model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (AA: −0.3 to 0.2, P = 0.042 vs CA: −0.1 to 0.0, P = 0.221). Despite efforts to maintain isoenergy state and consumption of similar energy, TAD induced weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity in both groups, while TWD worsened the metabolic profile.,

	abstract = {Background
The low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet (LCKD) may be effective for improving glycemia and reducing medications in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods
From an outpatient clinic, we recruited 28 overweight participants with type 2 diabetes for a 16-week single-arm pilot diet intervention trial. We provided LCKD counseling, with an initial goal of {\textless}20 g carbohydrate/day, while reducing diabetes medication dosages at diet initiation. Participants returned every other week for measurements, counseling, and further medication adjustment. The primary outcome was hemoglobin A1c.

Results
Twenty-one of the 28 participants who were enrolled completed the study. Twenty participants were men; 13 were White, 8 were African-American. The mean [± SD] age was 56.0 ± 7.9 years and BMI was 42.2 ± 5.8 kg/m2. Hemoglobin A1c decreased by 16\% from 7.5 ± 1.4\% to 6.3 ± 1.0\% (p {\textless} 0.001) from baseline to week 16. Diabetes medications were discontinued in 7 participants, reduced in 10 participants, and unchanged in 4 participants. The mean body weight decreased by 6.6\% from 131.4 ± 18.3 kg to 122.7 ± 18.9 kg (p {\textless} 0.001). In linear regression analyses, weight change at 16 weeks did not predict change in hemoglobin A1c. Fasting serum triglyceride decreased 42\% from 2.69 ± 2.87 mmol/L to 1.57 ± 1.38 mmol/L (p = 0.001) while other serum lipid measurements did not change significantly.

Conclusion
The LCKD improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes such that diabetes medications were discontinued or reduced in most participants. Because the LCKD can be very effective at lowering blood glucose, patients on diabetes medication who use this diet should be under close medical supervision or capable of adjusting their medication.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A previous paper reported the 6-month comparison of weight loss and metabolic changes in obese adults randomly assigned to either a low-carbohydrate diet or a conventional weight loss diet.
OBJECTIVE: To review the 1-year outcomes between these diets.
DESIGN: Randomized trial.
SETTING: Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
PARTICIPANTS: 132 obese adults with a body mass index of 35 kg/m2 or greater; 83\% had diabetes or the metabolic syndrome.
INTERVENTION: Participants received counseling to either restrict carbohydrate intake to {\textless}30 g per day (low-carbohydrate diet) or to restrict caloric intake by 500 calories per day with {\textless}30\% of calories from fat (conventional diet).
MEASUREMENTS: Changes in weight, lipid levels, glycemic control, and insulin sensitivity.
RESULTS: By 1 year, mean (+/-SD) weight change for persons on the low-carbohydrate diet was -5.1 +/- 8.7 kg compared with -3.1 +/- 8.4 kg for persons on the conventional diet. Differences between groups were not significant (-1.9 kg [95\% CI, -4.9 to 1.0 kg]; P = 0.20). For persons on the low-carbohydrate diet, triglyceride levels decreased more (P = 0.044) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased less (P = 0.025). As seen in the small group of persons with diabetes (n = 54) and after adjustment for covariates, hemoglobin A1c levels improved more for persons on the low-carbohydrate diet. These more favorable metabolic responses to a low-carbohydrate diet remained significant after adjustment for weight loss differences. Changes in other lipids or insulin sensitivity did not differ between groups.
LIMITATIONS: These findings are limited by a high dropout rate (34\%) and by suboptimal dietary adherence of the enrolled persons.
CONCLUSION: Participants on a low-carbohydrate diet had more favorable overall outcomes at 1 year than did those on a conventional diet. Weight loss was similar between groups, but effects on atherogenic dyslipidemia and glycemic control were still more favorable with a low-carbohydrate diet after adjustment for differences in weight loss.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare an energy-controlled LC diet with an LF diet at 1 y.
DESIGN: Men and women (n = 118) with abdominal obesity and at least one additional metabolic syndrome risk factor were randomly assigned to either an energy-restricted (approximately 6-7 MJ) LC diet (4\%, 35\%, and 61\% of energy as carbohydrate, protein, and fat, respectively) or an isocaloric LF diet (46\%, 24\%, and 30\% of energy as carbohydrate, protein, and fat, respectively) for 1 y. Weight, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk markers were assessed.
RESULTS: Sixty-nine participants (59\%) completed the trial: 33 in the LC group and 36 in the LF group. Both groups lost similar amounts of weight (LC: -14.5 +/- 1.7 kg; LF: -11.5 +/- 1.2 kg; P = 0.14, time x diet) and body fat (LC: -11.3 +/- 1.5 kg; LF: -9.4 +/- 1.2 kg; P = 0.30). Blood pressure, fasting glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, and C-reactive protein decreased independently of diet composition. Compared with the LF group, the LC group had greater decreases in triglycerides (-0.36 +/- 0.15 mmol/L; 95\% CI: -0.67, -0.05 mmol/L; P = 0.011), increases in HDL cholesterol (0.23 +/- 0.09 mmol/L; 95\% CI: 0.06, 0.40 mmol/L; P = 0.018) and LDL cholesterol (0.6 +/- 0.2 mmol/L; 95\% CI: 0.2, 1.0 mmol/L; P = 0.001), and a greater but nonsignificant increase in apolipoprotein B (0.08 +/- 0.04 g/L; 95\% CI: -0.004, 0.171 g/L; P = 0.17).
CONCLUSIONS: Under planned isoenergetic conditions, as expected, both dietary patterns resulted in similar weight loss and changes in body composition.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies identified conflicting results about the effects of wine intake on glucose parameters and the risk of cardiovascular diseases in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The present study further investigated the association between wine digestion and these outcomes in T2DM patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A search of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases (up to November 2018) was performed for randomized interventional trials which evaluated the effect of wine on blood pressure (BP), glucose parameters and lipid profiles in T2DM people. We used a variety of tests: fixed and random effects models, Q Cochrane test and I index, Egger and Begg tests, forest plots, and sensitivity analysis in our study.
RESULTS: A total of 9 randomized interventional studies were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, significant association between wine intake with diastolic BP (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 0.10; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI]: -0.01 to 0.20, P = .03 I = 13\%) and total cholesterol (TC) (WMD = 0.16, 95\% CI: 0.02-0.31, P = .03, I = 6\%), whereas no noticeable differences in glucose parameters, systolic BP, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) were identified between wine and controls groups (fasting glucose [FG],WMD = -0.00, 95\% CI: -0.58 to 0.58; fasting insulin [FI], -0.22, -2.09 to 1.65; HbAc1\%, -0.16, -0.40 to 0.07; systolic blood pressure, 0.12, -0.05 to 0.28; LDLC, -0.02, -0.25 to 0.21; TG, -0.34, -1.31 to 0.64; HDLC, 0.22, -0.08 to 0.53].
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis revealed that moderate wine consumption among T2DM patients could reduce the level of diastolic blood pressure and TC, but not glucose parameters and other cardiovascular risk factors.},

        Material and methods: A search of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases (up to November 2018) was performed for randomized interventional trials which evaluated the effect of wine on blood pressure (BP), glucose parameters and lipid profiles in T2DM people. We used a variety of tests: fixed and random effects models, Q Cochrane test and I2 index, Egger and Begg tests, forest plots, and sensitivity analysis in our study.
        Results: A total of 9 randomized interventional studies were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, significant association between wine intake with diastolic BP (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 0.10; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI]: −0.01 to 0.20, P = .03 I2 = 13\%) and total cholesterol (TC) (WMD = 0.16, 95\% CI: 0.02–0.31, P = .03, I2 = 6\%), whereas no noticeable differences in glucose parameters, systolic BP, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) were identified between wine and controls groups (fasting glucose [FG],WMD = −0.00, 95\% CI: −0.58 to 0.58; fasting insulin [FI], −0.22, −2.09 to 1.65; HbAc1\%, −0.16, −0.40 to 0.07; systolic blood pressure, 0.12, −0.05 to 0.28; LDLC, −0.02, −0.25 to 0.21; TG, −0.34, −1.31 to 0.64; HDLC, 0.22, −0.08 to 0.53].
        Conclusion: This meta-analysis revealed that moderate wine consumption among T2DM patients could reduce the level of diastolic blood pressure and TC, but not glucose parameters and other cardiovascular risk factors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by hyperinsulinemia. In 2011 we showed that gastric bypass (RYGB) corrects these high levels even though insulin resistance remains high, ie, the operation "dissociates" hyperinsulinemia from insulin resistance. RYGB produces reversal of T2DM along with other diseases associated with the metabolic syndrome. This observation led us to examine whether these illnesses also were characterized by hyperinsulinemia.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed to determine whether hyperinsulinemia was present in disorders associated with the metabolic syndrome. We reviewed 423 publications. 58 were selected because of appropriate documentation of insulin measurements. Comparisons were based on whether the studies reported patients as having increased versus normal insulin levels for each metabolic disorder.
RESULTS: The presence (+) or absence (-) of hyperinsulinemia was documented in these articles as follows: central obesity (4+ vs 0-), diabetes (5+ vs 0-), hypertension (9+ vs 1-), dyslipidemia (2+ vs 0-), renal failure (4+ vs 0-), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (5+ vs 0-), polycystic ovary syndrome (7+ vs 1-), sleep apnea (7+ vs 0-), certain cancers (4+ vs 1-), atherosclerosis (4+ vs 0-), and cardiovascular disease (8+ vs 0-). Four articles examined insulin levels in the metabolic syndrome as a whole (4+ vs 0-).
CONCLUSION: These data document that disorders linked to the metabolic syndrome are associated with high levels of insulin, suggesting that these diseases share a common etiology that is expressed by high levels of insulin. This leads us to propose the concept of a "hyperinsulinemic syndrome" and question the safety of insulin as a chronic therapy for patients with T2DM.},

Therefore, we assessed the effectiveness and safety of a novel care model providing continuous remote care with medication management based on biometric feedback combined with the metabolic approach of nutritional ketosis for T2D management.MethodsWe conducted an open-label, non-randomized, controlled, before-and-after 1-year study of this continuous care intervention (CCI) and usual care (UC). Primary outcomes were glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), weight, and medication use. Secondary outcomes included fasting serum glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, blood lipids and lipoproteins, liver and kidney function markers, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).Results349 adults with T2D enrolled: CCI: n = 262 [mean (SD); 54 (8) years, 116.5 (25.9) kg, 40.4 (8.8) kg m2, 92\% obese, 88\% prescribed T2D medication]; UC: n = 87 (52 (10) years, 105.6 (22.15) kg, 36.72 (7.26) kg m2, 82\% obese, 87\% prescribed T2D medication]. 218 participants (83\%) remained enrolled in the CCI at 1 year. Intention-to-treat analysis of the CCI (mean ± SE) revealed HbA1c declined from 59.6 ± 1.0 to 45.2 ± 0.8 mmol mol−1 (7.6 ± 0.09\% to 6.3 ± 0.07\%, P {\textless} 1.0 × 10−16), weight declined 13.8 ± 0.71 kg (P {\textless} 1.0 × 10−16), and T2D medication prescription other than metformin declined from 56.9 ± 3.1\% to 29.7 ± 3.0\% (P {\textless} 1.0 × 10−16). Insulin therapy was reduced or eliminated in 94\% of users; sulfonylureas were entirely eliminated in the CCI. No adverse events were attributed to the CCI. Additional CCI 1-year effects were HOMA-IR − 55\% (P = 3.2 × 10−5), hsCRP − 39\% (P {\textless} 1.0 × 10−16), triglycerides − 24\% (P {\textless} 1.0 × 10−16), HDL-cholesterol + 18\% (P {\textless} 1.0 × 10−16), and LDL-cholesterol + 10\% (P = 5.1 × 10−5); serum creatinine and liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and ALP) declined (P ≤ 0.0001), and apolipoprotein B was unchanged (P = 0.37). UC participants had no significant changes in biomarkers or T2D medication prescription at 1 year.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that a novel metabolic and continuous remote care model can support adults with T2D to safely improve HbA1c, weight, and other biomarkers while reducing diabetes medication use.ClinicalTrials.gov IdentifierNCT02519309.FundingVirta Health Corp., Plain Language SummaryTreatments for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have improved, yet T2D and being overweight are still significant public health concerns. Blood sugar in patients with T2D can improve quickly when patients eat significantly fewer dietary carbohydrates. However, this demands careful medicine management by doctors, and patients need support and frequent contact with health providers to sustain this way of living. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a new care model with very low dietary carbohydrate intake and continuous supervision by a health coach and doctor could safely lower HbA1c, weight and need for medicines after 1 year in adults with T2D. 262 adults with T2D volunteered to participate in this continuous care intervention (CCI) along with 87 adults with T2D receiving usual care (UC) from their doctors and diabetes education program. After 1 year, patients in the CCI, on average, lowered HbA1c from 7.6 to 6.3\%, lost 12\% of their body weight, and reduced diabetes medicine use. 94\% of patients who were prescribed insulin reduced or stopped their insulin use, and sulfonylureas were eliminated in all patients. Participants in the UC group had no changes to HbA1c, weight or diabetes medicine use over the year. These changes in CCI participants happened safely while dyslipidemia and markers of inflammation and liver function improved. This suggests the novel care model studied here using dietary carbohydrate restriction and continuous remote care can safely support adults with T2D to lower HbA1c, weight, and medicine use.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate whether a low-fat vegan diet improves glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors in individuals with type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Individuals with type 2 diabetes (n = 99) were randomly assigned to a low-fat vegan diet (n = 49) or a diet following the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines (n = 50). Participants were evaluated at baseline and 22 weeks.
RESULTS: Forty-three percent (21 of 49) of the vegan group and 26\% (13 of 50) of the ADA group participants reduced diabetes medications. Including all participants, HbA(1c) (A1C) decreased 0.96 percentage points in the vegan group and 0.56 points in the ADA group (P = 0.089). Excluding those who changed medications, A1C fell 1.23 points in the vegan group compared with 0.38 points in the ADA group (P = 0.01). Body weight decreased 6.5 kg in the vegan group and 3.1 kg in the ADA group (P {\textless} 0.001). Body weight change correlated with A1C change (r = 0.51, n = 57, P {\textless} 0.0001). Among those who did not change lipid-lowering medications, LDL cholesterol fell 21.2\% in the vegan group and 10.7\% in the ADA group (P = 0.02). After adjustment for baseline values, urinary albumin reductions were greater in the vegan group (15.9 mg/24 h) than in the ADA group (10.9 mg/24 h) (P = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: Both a low-fat vegan diet and a diet based on ADA guidelines improved glycemic and lipid control in type 2 diabetic patients. These improvements were greater with a low-fat vegan diet.},

	abstract = {Background
Increased consumption of high-fat diets is associated with the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Current models to study the mechanisms of high-fat diet-induced IR in humans are limited by their long duration or low efficacy. In the present study we developed and characterized an acute dietary model of saturated fatty acid-enriched diet induced insulin resistance.
Methods
High caloric diets enriched with saturated fatty acids (SFA) or carbohydrates (CARB) were evaluated in subjects with normal and impaired glucose tolerance (NGT or IGT). Both diets were compared to a standard eucaloric American Heart Association (AHA) control diet in a series of crossover studies. Whole body insulin resistance was estimated as steady state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentrations during the last 30min of a 3-h insulin suppression test.
Results
SSPG was increased after a 24-h SFA diet (by 83±74\% vs. control, n=38) in the entire cohort, which was comprised of participants with NGT (92±82\%, n=22) or IGT (65±55\%, n=16) (all p{\textless}0.001). SSPG was also increased after a single SFA breakfast (55±32\%, p=0.008, n=7). The increase in SSPG was less pronounced after an overnight fast following a daylong SFA diet (24±31\%, p=0.04, n=10), and further attenuated 24h after returning to the control diet (19±35\%, p=0.09, n=11). SSPG was not increased after a 24-h CARB diet (26±50\%, p=0.11, n=12).
Conclusions
A short-term SFA-enriched diet induced whole body insulin resistance in both NGT and IGT subjects. Insulin resistance persisted overnight after the last SFA meal and was attenuated by one day of a healthy diet. This model offers opportunities for identifying early mechanisms and potential treatments of dietary saturated fat induced insulin resistance.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (i.e., increased intrahepatic triglyceride [IHTG] content), predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue lipolysis and hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) are the main pathways contributing to IHTG. We hypothesized that dietary macronutrient composition influences the pathways, mediators, and magnitude of weight gain-induced changes in IHTG.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We overfed 38 overweight subjects (age 48 ± 2 years, BMI 31 ± 1 kg/m2, liver fat 4.7 ± 0.9\%) 1,000 extra kcal/day of saturated (SAT) or unsaturated (UNSAT) fat or simple sugars (CARB) for 3 weeks. We measured IHTG (1H-MRS), pathways contributing to IHTG (lipolysis ([2H5]glycerol) and DNL (2H2O) basally and during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia), insulin resistance, endotoxemia, plasma ceramides, and adipose tissue gene expression at 0 and 3 weeks.
RESULTS Overfeeding SAT increased IHTG more (+55\%) than UNSAT (+15\%, P {\textless} 0.05). CARB increased IHTG (+33\%) by stimulating DNL (+98\%). SAT significantly increased while UNSAT decreased lipolysis. SAT induced insulin resistance and endotoxemia and significantly increased multiple plasma ceramides. The diets had distinct effects on adipose tissue gene expression.
CONCLUSIONS Macronutrient composition of excess energy influences pathways of IHTG: CARB increases DNL, while SAT increases and UNSAT decreases lipolysis. SAT induced the greatest increase in IHTG, insulin resistance, and harmful ceramides. Decreased intakes of SAT could be beneficial in reducing IHTG and the associated risk of diabetes.},

	abstract = {Aims/hypothesis. The amount and quality of fat in the diet could be of importance for development of insulin resistance and related metabolic disorders. Our aim was to determine whether a change in dietary fat quality alone could alter insulin action in humans. Methods. The KANWU study included 162 healthy subjects chosen at random to receive a controlled, isoenergetic diet for 3 months containing either a high proportion of saturated (SAFA diet) or monounsaturated (MUFA diet) fatty acids. Within each group there was a second assignment at random to supplements with fish oil (3.6 g n-3 fatty acids/d) or placebo. Results. Insulin sensitivity was significantly impaired on the saturated fatty acid diet (-10 \%, p = 0.03) but did not change on the monounsaturated fatty acid diet ( + 2 \%, NS) (p = 0.05 for difference between diets). Insulin secretion was not affected. The addition of n-3 fatty acids influenced neither insulin sensitivity nor insulin secretion. The favourable effects of substituting a monounsaturated fatty acid diet for a saturated fatty acid diet on insulin sensitivity were only seen at a total fat intake below median (37E \%). Here, insulin sensitivity was 12.5 \% lower and 8.8 \% higher on the saturated fatty acid diet and monounsaturated fatty acid diet respectively (p = 0.03). Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) increased on the saturated fatty acid diet ( + 4.1 \%, p {\textless} 0.01) but decreased on the monounsaturated fatty acid diet (MUFA) (–5.2, p {\textless} 0.001), whereas lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] increased on a monounsaturated fatty acid diet by 12 \% (p {\textless} 0.001).

	abstract = {Summary
High-protein (HP) intake during weight loss (WL) therapy is often recommended because it reduces the loss of lean tissue mass. However, HP intake could have adverse effects on metabolic function, because protein ingestion reduces postprandial insulin sensitivity. In this study, we compared the effects of ∼10\% WL with a hypocaloric diet containing 0.8 g protein/kg/day and a hypocaloric diet containing 1.2 g protein/kg/day on muscle insulin action in postmenopausal women with obesity. We found that HP intake reduced the WL-induced decline in lean tissue mass by ∼45\%. However, HP intake also prevented the WL-induced improvements in muscle insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, as well as the WL-induced adaptations in oxidative stress and cell structural biology pathways. Our data demonstrate that the protein content of a WL diet can have profound effects on metabolic function and underscore the importance of considering dietary macronutrient composition during WL therapy for people with obesity.},

	abstract = {Ketogenic diets (KDs) are used for treatment of refractory epilepsy and metabolic disorders. The classic saturated fatty acid-enriched (SAT) KD has a fat:carbohydrate plus protein ratio of 4:1, in which the predominant fats are saturated. We hypothesized that a polyunsaturated fat-enriched (POLY) KD would induce a similar degree of ketosis with less detrimental effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Twenty healthy adults were randomized to two different weight-maintaining KDs for 5 d. Diets were 70\% fat, 15\% carbohydrate, and 15\% protein. The fat contents were 60 or 15\% saturated, 15 or 60\% polyunsaturated, and 25\% monounsaturated for SAT and POLY, respectively. Changes in serum beta-hydroxybutyrate, insulin sensitivity (S(I)), and lipid profiles were measured. Mean circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate levels increased 8.4 mg/dl in the POLY group (P = 0.0004), compared with 3.1 mg/dl in the SAT group (P = 0.07). S(I) increased significantly in the POLY group (P = 0.02), whereas total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly in the SAT group (both P = 0.002). These data demonstrate that a short-term POLY KD induces a greater level of ketosis and improves S(I), without adversely affecting total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared with a traditional SAT KD. Thus, a POLY KD may be superior to a classical SAT KD for chronic administration.},

METHODS: Glucose homeostasis, lipid homeostasis, and inflammation were studied in 17 men (BMI: 25-35â€‰kg/m2 ) during 4 weeks of a BD (15\% protein, 50\% carbohydrate, 35\% fat) followed by 4 weeks of an isocaloric KD (15\% protein, 5\% carbohydrate, 80\% fat). Postprandial responses were assessed following mixed-meal tests matched to compositions of the BD (control meal [CM]) and KD (ketogenic meal).
RESULTS: Fasting ketones, glycerol, free fatty acids, glucagon, adiponectin, gastric inhibitory peptide, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and C-reactive protein were significantly increased on the KD. Fasting insulin, C-peptides, triglycerides, and fibroblast growth factor 21 were significantly decreased. During the KD, the glucose area under the curve was significantly higher with both test meals, and the insulin area under the curve was significantly higher only for the CM. Analyses of glucose homeostasis suggested that the KD insulin sensitivity decreased during the CM but increased during the ketogenic meal. Insulin-mediated antilipolysis was decreased on the KD regardless of meal type.
CONCLUSIONS: Switching to the KD was associated with increased cholesterol and inflammatory markers, decreased triglycerides, and decreased insulin-mediated antilipolysis. Glucose homeostasis parameters were diet dependent and test meal dependent.},

We explored the association of SSB consumption with the risk of developing obesity and MetS among Korean adults (12,112 participants from the 2012–2016 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). We calculated the total SSB consumption frequency by counting each beverage item, including soda beverages, fruit juices, and sweetened rice drinks. Obesity was defined as a body mass index ≥25 kg/m2, and MetS was defined using the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III. A survey logistic regression analyses was conducted to examine the association of SSB consumption with obesity and MetS, adjusting for related confounders such as age, energy intake, household income, education, alcohol drinking, smoking status, and physical activity. The SSB consumption was positively associated with an increased risk of the prevalence for obesity (Odd ratio (OR): 1.60; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.23–2.09; p for trend = 0.0009) and MetS (OR: 1.61; 95\% CI: 1.20–2.16; p for trend = 0.0003) among women. In men, SSB consumption only contributed to a higher prevalence of obesity (OR: 1.38; 95\% CI: 1.11–1.72; p for trend = 0.0041). In conclusion, increased consumption of SSBs was closely linked with a higher prevalence of obesity and MetS in the Korean population.},

	abstract = {Background
Arterial aging is well characterized in industrial populations, but scantly described in populations with little access to modern medicine. Here we characterize health and aging among the Tsimane, Amazonian forager-horticulturalists with short life expectancy, high infectious loads and inflammation, but low adiposity and robust physical fitness. Inflammation has been implicated in all stages of arterial aging, atherogenesis and hypertension, and so we test whether greater inflammation associates with atherosclerosis and CVD risk. In contrast, moderate to vigorous daily activity, minimal obesity, and low fat intake predict minimal CVD risk among older Tsimane.

Methods and Findings
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), based on the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI), and hypertension were measured in Tsimane adults, and compared with rates from industrialized populations. No cases of PAD were found among Tsimane and hypertension was comparatively low (prevalence: 3.5\%, 40+; 23\%, 70+). Markers of infection and inflammation were much higher among Tsimane than among U.S. adults, whereas HDL was substantially lower. Regression models examine associations of ABI and BP with biomarkers of energy balance and metabolism and of inflammation and infection. Among Tsimane, obesity, blood lipids, and disease history were not significantly associated with ABI. Unlike the Tsimane case, higher cholesterol, C-reactive protein, leukocytes, cigarette smoking and systolic pressure among North Americans are all significantly associated with lower ABI.

Conclusions
Inflammation may not always be a risk factor for arterial degeneration and CVD, but instead may be offset by other factors: healthy metabolism, active lifestyle, favorable body mass, lean diet, low blood lipids and cardiorespiratory health. Other possibilities, including genetic susceptibility and the role of helminth infections, are discussed. The absence of PAD and CVD among Tsimane parallels anecdotal reports from other small-scale subsistence populations and suggests that chronic vascular disease had little impact on adult mortality throughout most of human evolutionary history.},

	abstract = {Background
Conventional coronary artery disease risk factors might potentially explain at least 90\% of the attributable risk of coronary artery disease. To better understand the association between the pre-industrial lifestyle and low prevalence of coronary artery disease risk factors, we examined the Tsimane, a Bolivian population living a subsistence lifestyle of hunting, gathering, fishing, and farming with few cardiovascular risk factors, but high infectious inflammatory burden.

Methods
We did a cross-sectional cohort study including all individuals who self-identified as Tsimane and who were aged 40 years or older. Coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring done with non-contrast CT in Tsimane adults. We assessed the difference between the Tsimane and 6814 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). CAC scores higher than 100 were considered representative of significant atherosclerotic disease. Tsimane blood lipid and inflammatory biomarkers were obtained at the time of scanning, and in some patients, longitudinally.

Findings
Between July 2, 2014, and Sept 10, 2015, 705 individuals, who had data available for analysis, were included in this study. 596 (85\%) of 705 Tsimane had no CAC, 89 (13\%) had CAC scores of 1–100, and 20 (3\%) had CAC scores higher than 100. For individuals older than age 75 years, 31 (65\%) Tsimane presented with a CAC score of 0, and only four (8\%) had CAC scores of 100 or more, a five-fold lower prevalence than industrialised populations (p≤0-0001 for all age categories of MESA). Mean LDL and HDL cholesterol concentrations were 2.35 mmol/L (91 mg/dL) and 1.0 mmol/L (39.5 mg/dL), respectively; obesity, hypertension, high blood sugar, and regular cigarette smoking were rare. High- sensitivity C-reactive protein was elevated beyond the clinical cutoff of 3.0 mg/dL in 360 (51\%) Tsimane participants.

Interpretation
Despite a high infectious inflammatory burden, the Tsimane, a forager-horticulturalist population of the Bolivian Amazon with few coronary artery disease risk factors, have the lowest reported levels of coronary artery disease of any population recorded to date. These findings suggest that coronary atherosclerosis can be avoided in most people by achieving a lifetime with very low LDL, low blood pressure, low glucose, normal body-mass index, no smoking, and plenty of physical activity. The relative contributions of each are still to be determined.

Also, the mechanisms involved in lipid changes especially in membrane proteins related to parasite infections remain uncertain. Present review of literature shows that parasites induce significant changes in lipid parameters, as has been shown in the in vitro study where substitution of serum by lipid/cholesterol in medium and in experimental models (in vivo). Thus changes in lipid profile occur in patients having active infections with most of the parasites. Membrane proteins are probably involved in such reactions. All parasites may be metabolising cholesterol, but the exact relationship with pathogenic mechanism is not clear. So far, studies suggest that there may be some factors or enzymes, which allow the parasite to breakup and consume lipid/cholesterol.

	abstract = {Several reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated the incontrovertible benefits of statin therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). But the role for statins in primary prevention remained unclear. The updated 2013 Cochrane review has put to rest all lingering doubts about the overwhelming benefits of long-term statin therapy in primary prevention by conclusively demonstrating highly significant reductions in all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and the need for coronary artery revascularization procedures (CARPs). More importantly, these benefits of statin therapy are similar at all levels of CVD risk, including subjects at low ({\textless}1\% per year) risk of a MACE. In addition to preventing myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and death, primary prevention with statins is also highly effective in delaying and avoiding expensive CARPs such as angioplasties, stents, and bypass surgeries. There is no evidence of any serious harm or threat to life caused by statin therapy, though several adverse effects that affect the quality of life, especially diabetes mellitus (DM) have been reported. Asian Indians have the highest risk of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes. When compared with Whites, Asian Indians have double the risk of CAD and triple the risk of DM, when adjusted for traditional risk factors for these diseases. Available evidence supports the use of statin therapy for primary prevention in Asian Indians at a younger age and with lower targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high density lipoprotein (non-HDL-C), than those currently recommended for Americans and Europeans. Early and aggressive statin therapy offers the greatest potential for reducing the continuing epidemic of CAD among Indians.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a growing public health problem, and the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality. Conversely, indigenous populations living traditional lifestyles reportedly engage in vigorous daily activity that is protective against non-communicable diseases. Here we analyze physical activity patterns among the Tsimane, forager-horticulturalists of Amazonian Bolivia with minimal heart disease and diabetes. We assess age patterns of adult activity among men and women, test whether modernization affects activity levels, and examine whether nascent obesity is associated with reduced activity.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A factorial method based on a large sample of behavioral observations was employed to estimate effects of age, sex, body mass index, and modernization variables on physical activity ratio (PAR), the ratio of total energy expenditure to basal metabolic rate. Accelerometry combined with heart rate monitoring was compared to the factorial method and used for nighttime sampling. Tsimane men and women display 24 hr physical activity level (PAL) of 2.02-2.15 and 1.73-1.85, respectively. Little time was spent "sedentary", whereas most activity was light to moderate, rather than vigorous. Activity peaks by the late twenties in men, and declines thereafter, but remains constant among women after the early teens. Neither BMI, fat free mass or body fat percentage are associated with PAR. There was no negative effect of modernization on physical activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Tsimane display relatively high PALs typical of other subsistence populations, but of moderate intensity, and not outside the range of developed populations. Despite rapidly increasing socioeconomic change, there is little evidence that total activity has yet been affected. Overweight and obesity are more prevalent among women than men, and Spanish fluency is associated with greater obesity in women. The lack of cardiovascular disease among Tsimane is unlikely caused by activity alone; further study of diet, food intake and infectious disease is needed.},

Potential benefits and risks have not been tested adequately.ObjectiveTo compare 4 weight-loss diets representing a spectrum of low to high carbohydrate intake for effects on weight loss and related metabolic variables.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsTwelve-month randomized trial conducted in the United States from February 2003 to October 2005 among 311 free-living, overweight/obese (body mass index, 27-40) nondiabetic, premenopausal women.InterventionParticipants were randomly assigned to follow the Atkins (n = 77), Zone (n = 79), LEARN (n = 79), or Ornish (n = 76) diets and received weekly instruction for 2 months, then an additional 10-month follow-up.Main Outcome MeasuresWeight loss at 12 months was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included lipid profile (low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels), percentage of body fat, waist-hip ratio, fasting insulin and glucose levels, and blood pressure. Outcomes were assessed at months 0, 2, 6, and 12. The Tukey studentized range test was used to adjust for multiple testing.ResultsWeight loss was greater for women in the Atkins diet group compared with the other diet groups at 12 months, and mean 12-month weight loss was significantly different between the Atkins and Zone diets (P\&lt;.05). Mean 12-month weight loss was as follows: Atkins, −4.7 kg (95\% confidence interval [CI], −6.3 to −3.1 kg), Zone, −1.6 kg (95\% CI, −2.8 to −0.4 kg), LEARN, −2.6 kg (−3.8 to −1.3 kg), and Ornish, −2.2 kg (−3.6 to −0.8 kg). Weight loss was not statistically different among the Zone, LEARN, and Ornish groups. At 12 months, secondary outcomes for the Atkins group were comparable with or more favorable than the other diet groups.ConclusionsIn this study, premenopausal overweight and obese women assigned to follow the Atkins diet, which had the lowest carbohydrate intake, lost more weight and experienced more favorable overall metabolic effects at 12 months than women assigned to follow the Zone, Ornish, or LEARN diets. While questions remain about long-term effects and mechanisms, a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet may be considered a feasible alternative recommendation for weight loss.Trial Registrationclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00079573},

	abstract = {Aims/hypothesis
Type 2 diabetes is regarded as inevitably progressive, with irreversible beta cell failure. The hypothesis was tested that both beta cell failure and insulin resistance can be reversed by dietary restriction of energy intake.

Methods
Eleven people with type 2 diabetes (49.5 ± 2.5 years, BMI 33.6 ± 1.2 kg/m2, nine male and two female) were studied before and after 1, 4 and 8 weeks of a 2.5 MJ (600 kcal)/day diet. Basal hepatic glucose output, hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity and beta cell function were measured. Pancreas and liver triacylglycerol content was measured using three-point Dixon magnetic resonance imaging. An age-, sex- and weight-matched group of eight non-diabetic participants was studied.

Results
After 1 week of restricted energy intake, fasting plasma glucose normalised in the diabetic group (from 9.2 ± 0.4 to 5.9 ± 0.4 mmol/l; p = 0.003). Insulin suppression of hepatic glucose output improved from 43 ± 4\% to 74 ± 5\% (p = 0.003 vs baseline; controls 68 ± 5\%). Hepatic triacylglycerol content fell from 12.8 ± 2.4\% in the diabetic group to 2.9 ± 0.2\% by week 8 (p = 0.003). The first-phase insulin response increased during the study period (0.19 ± 0.02 to 0.46 ± 0.07 nmol min−1 m−2; p {\textless} 0.001) and approached control values (0.62 ± 0.15 nmol min−1 m−2; p = 0.42). Maximal insulin response became supranormal at 8 weeks (1.37 ± 0.27 vs controls 1.15 ± 0.18 nmol min−1 m−2). Pancreatic triacylglycerol decreased from 8.0 ± 1.6\% to 6.2 ± 1.1\% (p = 0.03).

Conclusions/interpretation
Normalisation of both beta cell function and hepatic insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes was achieved by dietary energy restriction alone. This was associated with decreased pancreatic and liver triacylglycerol stores. The abnormalities underlying type 2 diabetes are reversible by reducing dietary energy intake.},

Most, although not all, studies suggest that higher levels of total fat in the diet result in greater whole-body insulin resistance. Although, in practice, obesity may complicate the relationship between fat intake and insulin resistance, clinical trials demonstrate that high levels of dietary fat can impair insulin sensitivity independent of body weight changes. In addition, it appears that different types of fat have different effects on insulin action. Saturated and certain monounsaturated fats have been implicated in causing insulin resistance, whereas polyunsaturated and omega-3 fatty acids largely do not appear to have adverse effects on insulin action. Given the importance of insulin resistance in the development of diabetes and heart disease, establishing appropriate levels of fat in the diet is an important clinical goal.},

	abstract = {The obesity epidemic in the U.S. has led to extensive research into potential contributing dietary factors, especially fat and fructose. Recently, increased consumption of soybean oil, which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), has been proposed to play a causal role in the epidemic. Here, we designed a series of four isocaloric diets (HFD, SO-HFD, F-HFD, F-SO-HFD) to investigate the effects of saturated versus unsaturated fat, as well as fructose, on obesity and diabetes. C57/BL6 male mice fed a diet moderately high in fat from coconut oil and soybean oil (SO-HFD, 40\% kcal total fat) showed statistically significant increases in weight gain, adiposity, diabetes, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance compared to mice on a diet consisting primarily of coconut oil (HFD). They also had fatty livers with hepatocyte ballooning and very large lipid droplets as well as shorter colonic crypt length. While the high fructose diet (F-HFD) did not cause as much obesity or diabetes as SO-HFD, it did cause rectal prolapse and a very fatty liver, but no balloon injury. The coconut oil diet (with or without fructose) increased spleen weight while fructose in the presence of soybean oil increased kidney weight. Metabolomics analysis of the liver showed an increased accumulation of PUFAs and their metabolites as well as Î³-tocopherol, but a decrease in cholesterol in SO-HFD. Liver transcriptomics analysis revealed a global dysregulation of cytochrome P450 (Cyp) genes in SO-HFD versus HFD livers, most notably in the Cyp3a and Cyp2c families. Other genes involved in obesity (e.g., Cidec, Cd36), diabetes (Igfbp1), inflammation (Cd63), mitochondrial function (Pdk4) and cancer (H19) were also upregulated by the soybean oil diet. Taken together, our results indicate that in mice a diet high in soybean oil is more detrimental to metabolic health than a diet high in fructose or coconut oil.},

	abstract = {Obesity increases the risk for type 2 diabetes through induction of insulin resistance. Treatment of type 2 diabetes has been limited by little translational knowledge of insulin resistance although there have been several well-documented hypotheses for insulin resistance. In those hypotheses, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, hyperinsulinemia and lipotoxicity have been the major concepts and have received a lot of attention. Oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, genetic background, aging, fatty liver, hypoxia and lipodystrophy are active subjects in the study of these concepts. However, none of those concepts or views has led to an effective therapy for type 2 diabetes. The reason is that there has been no consensus for a unifying mechanism of insulin resistance. In this review article, literature is critically analyzed and reinterpreted for a new energy-based concept of insulin resistance, in which insulin resistance is a result of energy surplus in cells. The energy surplus signal is mediated by ATP and sensed by adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. Decreasing ATP level by suppression of production or stimulation of utilization is a promising approach in the treatment of insulin resistance. In support, many of existing insulin sensitizing medicines inhibit ATP production in mitochondria. The effective therapies such as weight loss, exercise, and caloric restriction all reduce ATP in insulin sensitive cells. This new concept provides a unifying cellular and molecular mechanism of insulin resistance in obesity, which may apply to insulin resistance in aging and lipodystrophy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (i.e., increased intrahepatic triglyceride [IHTG] content), predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue lipolysis and hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) are the main pathways contributing to IHTG. We hypothesized that dietary macronutrient composition influences the pathways, mediators, and magnitude of weight gain-induced changes in IHTG.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We overfed 38 overweight subjects (age 48 ± 2 years, BMI 31 ± 1 kg/m2, liver fat 4.7 ± 0.9\%) 1,000 extra kcal/day of saturated (SAT) or unsaturated (UNSAT) fat or simple sugars (CARB) for 3 weeks. We measured IHTG (1H-MRS), pathways contributing to IHTG (lipolysis ([2H5]glycerol) and DNL (2H2O) basally and during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia), insulin resistance, endotoxemia, plasma ceramides, and adipose tissue gene expression at 0 and 3 weeks.
RESULTS: Overfeeding SAT increased IHTG more (+55\%) than UNSAT (+15\%, P {\textless} 0.05). CARB increased IHTG (+33\%) by stimulating DNL (+98\%). SAT significantly increased while UNSAT decreased lipolysis. SAT induced insulin resistance and endotoxemia and significantly increased multiple plasma ceramides. The diets had distinct effects on adipose tissue gene expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Macronutrient composition of excess energy influences pathways of IHTG: CARB increases DNL, while SAT increases and UNSAT decreases lipolysis. SAT induced the greatest increase in IHTG, insulin resistance, and harmful ceramides. Decreased intakes of SAT could be beneficial in reducing IHTG and the associated risk of diabetes.},

	abstract = {More than 20 years ago, Pories et al. published a seminal article, “Who Would Have Thought It? An Operation Proves to Be the Most Effective Therapy for Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus.” This was based on their observation that bariatric surgery rapidly normalized blood glucose levels in obese people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and 10 years later, almost 90\% remained diabetes free. Pories et al. suggested that caloric restriction played a key role and that the relative contributions of proximal intestinal nutrient exclusion, rapid distal gut nutrient delivery, and the role of gut hormones required further investigation. These findings of T2DM improvement/remission after bariatric surgery have been widely replicated, together with the observation that bariatric surgery prevents or delays incident T2DM. Over the ensuing two decades, important glucoregulatory roles of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract have been firmly established. However, the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial glycemic effects of bariatric surgery remain incompletely understood. In addition to the mechanisms proposed by Pories et al., changes in bile acid metabolism, GI tract nutrient sensing and glucose utilization, incretins, possible anti-incretin(s), and the intestinal microbiome are implicated. These changes, acting through peripheral and/or central pathways, lead to reduced hepatic glucose production, increased tissue glucose uptake, improved insulin sensitivity, and enhanced β-cell function. A constellation of factors, rather than a single overarching mechanism, likely mediate postoperative glycemic improvement, with the contributing factors varying according to the surgical procedure. Thus, different bariatric/metabolic procedures provide us with experimental tools to probe GI tract physiology. Embracing this approach through the application of detailed phenotyping, genomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome studies will enhance our understanding of metabolic regulation and help identify novel therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {Incretin hormones are gut peptides that are secreted after nutrient intake and stimulate insulin secretion together with hyperglycaemia. GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) und GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) are the known incretin hormones from the upper (GIP, K cells) and lower (GLP-1, L cells) gut. Together, they are responsible for the incretin effect: a two- to three-fold higher insulin secretory response to oral as compared to intravenous glucose administration. In subjects with type 2 diabetes, this incretin effect is diminished or no longer present. This is the consequence of a substantially reduced effectiveness of GIP on the diabetic endocrine pancreas, and of the negligible physiological role of GLP-1 in mediating the incretin effect even in healthy subjects. However, the insulinotropic and glucagonostatic effects of GLP-1 are preserved in subjects with type 2 diabetes to the degree that pharmacological stimulation of GLP-1 receptors significantly reduces plasma glucose and improves glycaemic control. Thus, it has become a parent compound of incretin-based glucose-lowering medications (GLP-1 receptor agonists and inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 or DPP-4). GLP-1, in addition, has multiple effects on various organ systems. Most relevant are a reduction in appetite and food intake, leading to weight loss in the long term. Since GLP-1 secretion from the gut seems to be impaired in obese subjects, this may even indicate a role in the pathophysiology of obesity. Along these lines, an increased secretion of GLP-1 induced by delivering nutrients to lower parts of the small intestines (rich in L cells) may be one factor (among others like peptide YY) explaining weight loss and improvements in glycaemic control after bariatric surgery (e.g., Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). GIP and GLP-1, originally characterized as incretin hormones, have additional effects in adipose cells, bone, and the cardiovascular system. Especially, the latter have received attention based on recent findings that GLP-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide reduce cardiovascular events and prolong life in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes. Thus, incretin hormones have an important role physiologically, namely they are involved in the pathophysiology of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and they have therapeutic potential that can be traced to well-characterized physiological effects.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To compare the effects on insulin sensitivity, body composition and glycaemic control of the recommended standard weight-maintaining diabetes diet and an isocaloric low-fat diabetes diet during two, 3-month periods in patients with Type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: Thirteen Type 1 patients were included, of whom 10 completed the cross-over study. Ten non-diabetic, matched control subjects were also examined. Body composition was estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) whole-body scanning, diet intake was monitored by 7-day dietary record and insulin sensitivity was measured by the insulin clamp technique at baseline and after each of the diet intervention periods.
RESULTS: On an isocaloric low-fat diet, Type 1 diabetic patients significantly reduced the proportion of fat in the total daily energy intake by 12.1\% (or -3.6\% of total energy) as compared with a conventional diabetes diet (P = 0.039). The daily protein and carbohydrate intake increased (+4.4\% of total energy intake, P = 0.0049 and +2.5\%, P = 0.34, respectively), while alcohol intake decreased (-3.2\% of total energy intake, P = 0.02). There was a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity on the isocaloric, low-fat diet compared with the standard diabetes diet [7.06 +/- 2.16 mg/kg/min (mean +/- sd) vs. 5.52 +/- 2.35 mg/kg/min (P = 0.03)]. However, insulin sensitivity remained 33\% lower than in the control subjects (P = 0.021). No significant changes occurred in body weight or body composition. Glycated haemoglobin rose during both diet intervention periods (P = 0.18), with no difference between the two diets.
CONCLUSIONS: Change to an isocaloric, low-fat diet in Type 1 diabetic patients during a 3-month period resulted in significant improvement in insulin sensitivity without improvement in glycaemic control. However, insulin sensitivity remained 33\% lower than in control subjects.},

	abstract = {Insulin resistance underlies type 2 diabetes, CVD and the metabolic syndrome, driven by changes in diet, lifestyle, energy over-consumption and obesity. Nutritional recommendations for insulin resistance remain an area of controversy, particularly the quantity and types of dietary carbohydrate. The present review gives an overview of insulin resistance, its relationship to impaired insulin secretion and the metabolic syndrome, research methodologies used to measure insulin action and the epidemiological and intervention studies on the relationship between dietary carbohydrate and insulin resistance. Epidemiological studies provide little evidence to suggest that total dietary carbohydrate predicts risk of type 2 diabetes, and high-carbohydrate, high-fibre diets with low-glycaemic index (GI) may even contribute to diabetes prevention. Despite inherent limitations associated with techniques used to measure insulin resistance and dietary assessment, most intervention studies reveal an increase in glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity with high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets in non-diabetic and diabetic individuals. When energy is restricted the source or reduced content of carbohydrate does not appear to be as important as fat for body weight. Thus, low energy intake is key to weight loss and augmentation of insulin sensitivity. Given this, widespread adoption of popular low-carbohydrate high-fat diets highlights the necessity to evaluate dietary interventions regarding safety and metabolic effects. While current evidence supports FAO/WHO recommendations to maintain a high-carbohydrate diet with low-GI foods, the relationships between carbohydrate and insulin sensitivity remains an important research area. Emerging technologies should further enhance understanding of gene-diet interactions in insulin resistance, providing useful information for future nutrition policy decisions.},

Here, we assessed whether glucose could regulate gene expression in contracting myotubes deriving from cultured muscle satellite cells. Glucose uptake increased twofold after a 30 minute treatment with a high glucose concentration, suggesting an acute glucose-stimulated glucose uptake. Time-course experiments showed that, within 3 hours, glucose stimulated the expression of hexokinase II, fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA-carboxylase-2 proteins, leading to an increased lipogenic flux and intracellular lipid accumulation in contracting myotubes. Furthermore, kinetic experiments indicated that glucose upregulated SREBP-1c precursor and nuclear proteins within 30 minutes, SREBP-1c nuclear translocation being confirmed using immunocytochemistry. In addition, the knockdown of SREBP-1 mRNA using a RNA-interference technique totally abrogated the glucose-induced upregulation of lipogenic enzymes, indicating that SREBP-1c mediates the action of glucose on these genes in rat skeletal muscle. Finally, we found that glucose rapidly stimulated SREBP-1c maturation through a Jak/STAT dependent pathway. We propose that increased intramuscular lipid accumulation associated with muscle insulin resistance in obesity or type-2 diabetes could arise partly from de novo fatty acid synthesis in skeletal muscle.},

This paper first revisits the physiological significance of these mutual interactions between glucose and lipids in skeletal muscle pertaining to both blood glucose and intramyocellular lipid homeostasis. It then concentrates upon emerging evidence, from calorimetric studies investigating the direct effect of leptin on thermogenesis in intact skeletal muscle, of yet another feature of the mutual interaction between glucose and lipid oxidation: that of substrate cycling between de novo lipogenesis and lipid oxidation. It is proposed that this energy-dissipating substrate cycling that links glucose and lipid metabolism to thermogenesis could function as a ‘fine-tuning’ mechanism that regulates intramyocellular lipid homeostasis, and hence contributes to the protection of skeletal muscle against lipotoxicity.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review The present review outlines possible mechanisms by which high fatty acids, associated with high-fat diet and obesity, impose insulin resistance on glucose uptake into skeletal muscle.
        Recent findings It is well established that muscle insulin resistance arises in conditions of high-fatty acid availability, and correlates with accumulation of triglycerides within skeletal muscle fibres. However, it is debated whether triglycerides or other lipid metabolites such as diacylglycerols and ceramides are directly responsible. These lipid metabolites can activate serine kinases that impair insulin signalling. Accumulation of acylcarnitines and reactive oxygen species could be additional causative agents of insulin resistance. Further, the precise defects in insulin signalling in muscle caused by high intramuscular lipid (i.e. lipotoxicity) remain unclear. In parallel, proinflammatory activation within the adipose tissue of obese and high-fat fed animals or humans causes muscle insulin resistance, and is ascribed to circulating inflammatory cytokines. Recent evidence also shows proinflammatory macrophages infiltrating muscle tissue and/or intermuscular adipose tissue, and there is growing evidence that fatty acids trigger macrophages to secrete factors that directly impair insulin actions. These factors are postulated to activate stress-signalling pathways in muscle that act on the same insulin-signalling components affected by lipotoxicity.
        Summary Altered intramuscular lipid metabolism, circulating cytokines, and inflammatory macrophage infiltration of muscle tissue have been recently linked to muscle insulin resistance provoked by fatty acids. Each is analysed separately in this review, but they may act simultaneously and synergistically to render skeletal muscle insulin-resistant.},

We examined the hypothesis that muscle insulin resistance in healthy aging promotes increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and hyperlipidemia by altering the distribution pattern of postprandial energy storage. Healthy, normal weight, sedentary elderly subjects pair-matched to young subjects were given two high-carbohydrate meals followed by 13C/1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements of postprandial changes in muscle and liver glycogen and lipid content, and assessment of DNL using 2H2O. Net muscle glycogen synthesis was reduced by 45\% (P {\textless} 0.007) in the elderly subjects compared with the young, reflecting severe muscle insulin resistance. Net liver glycogen synthesis was similar between groups (elderly, 143 ± 23 mmol/L vs. young, 138 ± 13 mmol/L; P = NS). Hepatic DNL was more than twofold higher in the elderly than in the young subjects (elderly, 14.5 ± 1.4\% vs. young, 6.9 ± 0.7\%; P = 0.00015) and was associated with approximately threefold higher postprandial hepatic triglyceride (TG) content (P {\textless} 0.005) and increased fasting plasma TGs (elderly, 1.19 ± 0.18 mmol/L vs. young, 0.74 ± 0.11 mmol/L; P = 0.02). These results strongly support the hypothesis that muscle insulin resistance in aging promotes hyperlipidemia and NAFLD by altering the pattern of postprandial carbohydrate storage away from muscle glycogen and into hepatic DNL.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies have revealed that high consumption of soy products is associated with low incidences of hormone-dependent cancers, including breast and prostate cancer. Soybeans contain large amounts of isoflavones, such as the genistein and daidzain. Previously, it has been demonstrated that genistein, one of the predominant soy isoflavones, can inhibit several steps involved in carcinogenesis. It is suggested that genistein possesses pleiotropic molecular mechanisms of action including inhibition of tyrosine kinases, DNA topoisomerase II, 5α-reductase, galectin-induced G2/M arrest, protein histidine kinase, and cyclin-dependent kinases, modulation of different signaling pathways associated with the growth of cancer cells (e.g., NF-κB, Akt, MAPK), etc. Moreover, genistein is also a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. Uncontrolled angiogenesis is considered as a key step in cancer growth, invasion, and metastasis. Genistein was found to inhibit angiogenesis through regulation of multiple pathways, such as regulation of VEGF, MMPs, EGFR expressions and NF-κB, PI3-K/Akt, ERK1/2 signaling pathways, thereby causing strong antiangiogenic effects. This review focuses on the antiangiogenic properties of soy isoflavonoids and examines their possible underlying mechanisms.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Iodine intake by adults in farming districts in Northeastern Japan was evaluated by two methods: (1) government-approved food composition tables based calculation and (2) instrumental measurement. The correlation between these two values and a regression model for the calibration of calculated values was presented.
METHODS: Iodine intake was calculated, using the values in the Japan Standard Tables of Food Composition (FCT), through the analysis of duplicate samples of complete 24-h food consumption for 90 adult subjects. In cases where the value for iodine content was not available in the FCT, it was assumed to be zero for that food item (calculated values). Iodine content was also measured by ICP-MS (measured values).
RESULTS: Calculated and measured values rendered geometric means (GM) of 336 and 279 μg/day, respectively. There was no statistically significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05) difference between calculated and measured values. The correlation coefficient was 0.646 (p {\textless} 0.05).
DISCUSSION: With this high correlation coefficient, a simple regression line can be applied to estimate measured value from calculated value. A survey of the literature suggests that the values in this study were similar to values that have been reported to date for Japan, and higher than those for other countries in Asia.
CONCLUSIONS: Iodine intake of Japanese adults was 336 μg/day (GM, calculated) and 279 μg/day (GM, measured). Both values correlated so well, with a correlation coefficient of 0.646, that a regression model (Y = 130.8 + 1.9479X, where X and Y are measured and calculated values, respectively) could be used to calibrate calculated values.},

	abstract = {Background
Iodine intake is considered to be high in Japan due to regular seaweed consumption. Subgroups that do not have a traditional Japanese-style diet may consume insufficient amounts of iodine.

Method
Three hundred and ninety apparently healthy adults (195 men and 195 women) aged 20 to 69 years from 20 areas throughout Japan completed four-day diet records and collected a 24-h urine sample. Dietary patterns were extracted from 31 food groups by cluster analysis. The iodine adequacy of each dietary pattern was examined using reference values from the Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese.

Results
Three dietary patterns, labelled “Cluster I (Rice and vegetables)” (n = 101), “Cluster II (Meat, non-Japanese noodles, and sugar-sweetened beverages)” (n = 34), and “Cluster III (Fish, Japanese noodles, and alcohol)” (n = 60), were identified in male subjects. Another set of three patterns, “Cluster I (Rice and vegetables)” (n = 22), “Cluster II (Fish and Japanese noodles)” (n = 33), and “Cluster III (Bread and non-Japanese noodles)” (n = 140), was found in female subjects. Although the habitual iodine intake of almost all participants was above the estimated average requirement (EAR), iodine intake was statistically significantly lowest in Cluster II in men and Cluster III in women. Moreover, the mean participant age was the youngest in these clusters.

Conclusion
Although Japan is known as a high iodine-consuming country, some Japanese individuals who do not eat a traditional Japanese-style diet consume low amounts of iodine. Since younger people tend to have modern, Westernized dietary patterns, iodine deficiency might be given additional consideration hereafter in Japan.

	abstract = {Background
Since seaweed is a common component of the Japanese diet, iodine intake in Japanese is expected to be high. However, urinary iodine excretion, measured using 24-hour urine samples, and its dietary determinants are not known.

Methods
Apparently healthy adults aged 20 to 69 years living in 20 areas throughout Japan were recruited in February and March, 2013. Urinary iodine excretion was evaluated using 24-hour urine collected from 713 subjects (362 men and 351 women), and the difference among age groups was assessed. The association between dietary intake of food groups and urinary iodine excretion was assessed among 358 subjects who completed a semi-weighed 4-day diet record (DR) and urine collection. The correlations between iodine intake and iodine excretion were also evaluated, and correlation coefficients were calculated for iodine intake in the DR of the overlapping day or the DR 1 day before and after urine collection.

Results
Median iodine excretion in 24-hour urine was 365 Âµg, and excretion was significantly higher in older subjects. Iodine intake estimated by the DRs was significantly correlated with urinary iodine excretion when DRs and urine collection were obtained on the same day (r = 0.37). After adjustment for confounding factors, iodine excretion was significantly associated with intakes of kelp and soup stock from kelp and fish.

Conclusions
Although multiple measurements for urinary iodine are required to confirm our results, this study showed the current iodine status of healthy Japanese adults. The results suggest that kelp and fish are the main contributors to Japanese iodine status measured by 24-hour urine.},
