# Cite Reddit
Creating a reference database from citations made on reddit.

# Intro
Many subreddits revolve around academic citations. [/r/Nootropics/][], [/r/DrugNerds/][], [/r/FoodNerds/][] are among my favorite sources for new science. Unfortunately, these academic reddits consist of a loose collection of urls. They lack the sharability of a bibliographic database.
I propose creating a research database through a popular reference manager like Zotero or Mendeley. We could, of course, do this manually, but ain't nobody got time for that. Scraping for citations automatically sounds like a better option.

# Plan

(#) scrape subreddit for links
(#) import links to [Zotero Group][]
(#) export group to [Mendeley Group][]
