	abstract = {Hormonal contraceptives are on the market for more than 50 years and used by 100 million women worldwide. However, while endogenous steroids have been convincingly associated with change in brain structure, function and cognitive performance, the effects of synthetic steroids contained in hormonal contraceptives on brain and cognition have barely been investigated. In this article we summarize the sparse findings, describing brain structural, functional and behavioral findings from the literature and suggest that synthetic steroids may contribute to masculinizing as well as feminizing effects on brain and behavior. We try to identify methodological challenges, explain, how results on endogenous steroids may transfer into research on hormonal contraceptives and point out factors that need to be controlled in the study of hormonal contraceptive dependent effects. We conclude that there is a strong need for more systematic studies, especially on brain structural, functional and cognitive changes due to hormonal contraceptive use. The hormonal contraceptive pill is the major tool for population control. Hence, such behavioral changes could cause a shift in society dynamics and should not stay unattended.},

	abstract = {Millions of women use hormonal contraception and it has been suggested that such use may alter mate preferences. To examine the impact of oral contraceptive (pill) use on preferences, we tested for within-subject changes in preferences for masculine faces in women initiating pill use. Between two sessions, initiation of pill use significantly decreased women's preferences for male facial masculinity but did not influence preferences for same-sex faces. To test whether altered preference during pill use influences actual partner choice, we examined facial characteristics in 170 age-matched male partners of women who reported having either been using or not using the pill when the partnership was formed. Both facial measurements and perceptual judgements demonstrated that partners of women who used the pill during mate choice have less masculine faces than partners of women who did not use hormonal contraception at this time. Our data (A) provide the first experimental evidence that initiation of pill use in women causes changes in facial preferences and (B) documents downstream effects of these changes on real-life partner selection. Given that hormonal contraceptive use is widespread, effects of pill use on the processes of partner formation have important implications for relationship stability and may have other biologically relevant consequences.},

METH use elicits a myriad of social consequences and the behavioral impact of the drug is well understood. However, new information has recently emerged detailing the devastating effects of METH on host immunity, increasing the acquisition of diverse pathogens and exacerbating the severity of disease. These outcomes manifest as modifications in protective physical and chemical defenses, pro-inflammatory responses, and the induction of oxidative stress pathways. Through these processes, significant neurotoxicities arise, and, as such, chronic abusers with these conditions are at a higher risk for heightened consequences. METH use also influences the adaptive immune response, permitting the unrestrained development of opportunistic diseases. In this review, we discuss recent literature addressing the impact of METH on infection and immunity, and identify areas ripe for future investigation.},

	abstract = {Cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of dementia and a prominent feature in psychiatric disease. As non-redundant regulators of intracellular cAMP gradients, phosphodiesterases (PDE) mediate fundamental aspects of brain function relevant to learning, memory, and higher cognitive functions. Phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B) is an important phosphodiesterase in the hippocampal formation, is a major Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) binding partner and is itself a risk gene for psychiatric illness. To define the effects of specific inhibition of the PDE4B subtype, we generated mice with a catalytic domain mutant form of PDE4B (Y358C) that has decreased ability to hydrolyze cAMP. Structural modeling predictions of decreased function and impaired binding with DISC1 were confirmed in cell assays. Phenotypic characterization of the PDE4BY358C mice revealed facilitated phosphorylation of CREB, decreased binding to DISC1, and upregulation of DISC1 and Î²-Arrestin in hippocampus and amygdala. In behavioral assays, PDE4BY358C mice displayed decreased anxiety and increased exploration, as well as cognitive enhancement across several tests of learning and memory, consistent with synaptic changes including enhanced long-term potentiation and impaired depotentiation ex vivo. PDE4BY358C mice also demonstrated enhanced neurogenesis. Contextual fear memory, though intact at 24 h, was decreased at 7 days in PDE4BY358C mice, an effect replicated pharmacologically with a non-selective PDE4 inhibitor, implicating cAMP signaling by PDE4B in a very late phase of consolidation. No effect of the PDE4BY358C mutation was observed in the prepulse inhibition and forced swim tests. Our data establish specific inhibition of PDE4B as a promising therapeutic approach for disorders of cognition and anxiety, and a putative target for pathological fear memory.},

	abstract = {Serotonin has been implicated in promoting self-control, regulation of hunger and physiological homeostasis, and regulation of caloric intake. However, it remains unclear whether the effects of serotonin on caloric intake reflect purely homeostatic mechanisms, or whether serotonin also modulates cognitive processes involved in dietary decision making. We investigated the effects of an acute dose of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram on choices between food items that differed along taste and health attributes, compared with placebo and the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine. Twenty-seven participants attended three sessions and received single doses of atomoxetine, citalopram, and placebo in a double-blind randomised cross-over design. Relative to placebo, citalopram increased choices of more healthy foods over less healthy foods. Citalopram also increased the emphasis on health considerations in decisions. Atomoxetine did not affect decision making relative to placebo. The results support the hypothesis that serotonin may influence food choice by enhancing a focus on long-term goals. The findings are relevant for understanding decisions about food consumption and also for treating health conditions such as eating disorders and obesity.},

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD003012.pub2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although there is a consensus that antidepressants are effective in depression, placebo effects are also thought to be substantial. Side effects of antidepressants may reveal the identity of medication to participants or investigators and thus may bias the results of conventional trials using inert placebos. Using an 'active' placebo which mimics some of the side effects of antidepressants may help to counteract this potential bias.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy of antidepressants when compared with 'active' placebos.
SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis review groups's search strategy was used to search MEDLINE (1966-2000), PsychLIT (1980-2000) and EMBASE (1974-2000) and this was last done in July 2000. Reference lists from relevant articles and textbooks were searched and 12 specialist journals were handsearched up to 1996.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials comparing antidepressants with active placebos in people with depression.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Since many different outcome measures were used a standard measure of effect was calculated for each trial. A subgroup analysis of inpatient and outpatient trials was conducted. Two reviewers independently assessed whether each trial met inclusion criteria.
MAIN RESULTS: Nine studies involving 751 participants were included. Two of them produced effect sizes which showed a consistent and statistically significant difference in favour of the active drug. Combining all studies produced a pooled estimate of effect of 0.39 standard deviations (confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.54) in favour of the antidepressant measured by improvement in mood. There was high heterogeneity due to one strongly positive trial. Sensitivity analysis omitting this trial reduced the pooled effect to 0.17 (0.00 to 0.34). The pooled effect for inpatient and outpatient trials was highly sensitive to decisions about which combination of data was included but inpatient trials produced the lowest effects.
REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The more conservative estimates from the present analysis found that differences between antidepressants and active placebos were small. This suggests that unblinding effects may inflate the efficacy of antidepressants in trials using inert placebos. Further research into unblinding is warranted.},

Although negative information-processing biases have been studied using both behavioral and neuroimaging paradigms, relatively little research has been conducted examining the difficulties of depressed persons with inhibiting the retrieval of negative information from long-term memory. In this study, we used the think/no-think paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the cognitive and neural consequences of memory suppression in individuals diagnosed with depression and in healthy controls. The participants showed typical behavioral forgetting effects, but contrary to our hypotheses, there were no differences between the depressed and nondepressed participants or between neutral and negative memories. Relative to controls, depressed individuals exhibited greater activity in right middle frontal gyrus during memory suppression, regardless of the valence of the suppressed stimuli, and differential activity in the amygdala and hippocampus during memory suppression involving negatively valenced stimuli. These findings indicate that depressed individuals are characterized by neural anomalies during the suppression of long-term memories, increasing our understanding of the brain bases of negative cognitive biases in MDD.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The polyphenol resveratrol has shown regulatory effects on hippocampal neurogenesis, which according to the neurovascular niche hypothesis, is likely to involve stimulation of angiogenesis. In rodents, global cerebral ischemia leads to selective CA1 neuronal damage, spatial memory impairments, lasting changes in corticosterone (CORT) secretion, and increased neurogenesis. This study examined dose-related effects of 21-day RSV treatment on markers associated with neurogenesis (DCX, PSA-NCAM) and angiogenesis (CD31) in the hippocampus at short (7-day) and long-term (85-day) intervals following global ischemia. In parallel, post-ischemic and stress-induced CORT levels and spatial memory in the Morris water maze were determined.Methods: Five groups of male Wistar rats were included: sham/saline, ischemia/saline, ischemia/1 mg/kg RSV, ischemia/10 mg/kg RSV, and sham/10 mg/kg RSV. Changes in expression of plasticity markers were paralleled by assessment of basal- and stress-induced CORT secretions, and spatial memory performance.Results: Our findings revealed a significant attenuation of ischemia-induced DCX/PSA-NCAM expression in RSV-treated rats, whereas RSV treatment increased angiogenesis in the injured CA1 region. RSV attenuated CORT levels 3 days post-ischemia and a trend toward attenuating CORT secretion in response to 15 minutes restraint stress. Increased swimming latencies in the target quadrant during the MWM probe trial in RSV-treated ischemic rats support beneficial effects of RSV on spatial memory retention.Discussion: Our findings uncover time- and dose-related effects of RSV and global ischemia on the regulation of hippocampal plasticity. Changes in neuro- and angiogenesis are consistent with RSV neuroprotective effects, but appear independent of RSV regulatory effects on corticosterone secretion.},

Traditionally, depression has been linked to psychological and biological causes, but there has been increasing interest in the gut–brain axis.

Furthermore, bacteria that previously have been identified as being correlated with depression were also correlated with isovaleric acid. Isovaleric acid showed a bimodal distribution in which the depressed patients were overrepresented in the high level group (P {\textless} 0.00005, binominal test).Discussion: It has recently been shown that gut-derived VFAs can cross the blood–brain barrier, where isovaleric acid interferes with synaptic neurotransmitter release. The multiple correlation patterns, in addition to a potential mechanistic model, point towards a potential causal relationship between depression and isovaleric acid.},

	abstract = {RationaleThe default mode network (DMN), one of several resting-state networks (RSN) in the brain, is thought to be involved in self-referential thought, awareness, and episodic memories. Nicotine improves cognitive performance, in part by improving attention. Nicotinic agonists have been shown to decrease activity in regions within DMN and increase activity in regions involved in visual attention during effortful processing of external stimuli. It is unknown if these pharmacological effects also occur in the absence of effortful processing.ObjectivesThis study aims to determine if nicotine suppresses activity in default mode and enhances activity in extra-striate RSNs in the absence of an external visual task.MethodsWithin-subject, single-blinded, counterbalanced study of 19 non-smoking subjects who had resting functional MRI scans after 7 mg nicotine or placebo patch. Group independent component analysis was performed. The DMN component was identified by spatial correlation with a reference DMN mask. A visual attention component was identified by spatial correlation with an extra-striate mask. Analyses were conducted using statistical parametric mapping.ResultsNicotine was associated with decreased activity in regions within the DMN and increased activity in extra-striate regions.ConclusionsSuppression of DMN and enhancement of extra-striate resting-state activity in the absence of visual stimuli or effortful processing suggest that nicotine's cognitive effects may involve a shift in activity from networks that process internal to those that process external information. This is a potential mechanism by which cholinergic agonists may have a beneficial effect in diseases associated with altered resting-state activity.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies have observed that older adults who consume light to moderate amounts of alcohol have higher cognitive functioning and are less likely to develop different types of dementia, including Alzheimerâ€™s disease, compared to older adults who do not consume alcohol. Similar findings have been reported by studies that have examined midlife alcohol consumption and cognitive functioning during old age. The apparent benefits of consuming light to moderate amounts of alcohol have been attributed to increased cell proliferation in specific regions of the brain, antioxidative properties of alcohol, and reduced risk for health conditions associated with accelerated cognitive decline and dementia. However, there is a debate regarding whether alcohol plays a causal role in preserving cognitive functioning during old age and older adults who abstain from alcohol should not be advised to start consuming alcohol. The objective of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence from animal and human studies that have examined the effect that alcohol consumption has on the brain and cognitive functioning. This chapter also reviews the evidence for a causal relationship between alcohol and cognition as well as alternative explanations for the observed findings from epidemiological studies. Finally, we conclude by providing future research directions that can be pursued to clarify the relationship between alcohol consumption and cognitive functioning during old age.},

	abstract = {The pineal gland has a romantic history, from pharaonic Egypt, where it was equated with the eye of Horus, through various religious traditions, where it was considered the seat of the soul, the third eye, etc. Recent incarnations of these notions have suggested that DMT is secreted by the pineal at birth, during dreaming, and at near death to produce out of body experiences. Scientific evidence, however, is not consistent with these ideas. The adult pineal gland weighs less than 0.2 grams, and its principal function is to produce 30 micrograms per day of melatonin, a hormone that regulates circadian rhythm through very high a nity interactions with melatonin receptors. Very minute concentrations of DMT have been detected in brain, but they are not sufficient to produce psychoactive effects. Alternative explanations will be presented to explain how stress and near death can produce altered states of consciousness without invoking DMT.

Several lines of evidence suggest that ketamine may impair PFC function in part by interacting with dopamine neurotransmission in this region. This study sought to determine the mechanism by which ketamine may disrupt dopaminergic neurotransmission in, and cognitive functions associated with, the PFC. A thorough dose-response study using microdialysis in conscious rats indicated that low doses of ketamine (10, 20, and 30 mg/kg) increase glutamate outflow in the PFC, suggesting that at these doses ketamine may increase glutamatergic neurotransmission in the PFC at non-NMDA glutamate receptors. An anesthetic dose of ketamine (200 mg/kg) decreased, and an intermediate dose of 50 mg/kg did not affect, glutamate levels. Ketamine, at 30 mg/kg, also increased the release of dopamine in the PFC. This increase was blocked by intra-PFC application of the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione CNQX. Furthermore, ketamine-induced activation of dopamine release and impairment of spatial delayed alternation in the rodent, a PFC-sensitive cognitive task, was ameliorated by systemic pretreatment with AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist LY293558. These findings suggest that ketamine may disrupt dopaminergic neurotransmission in the PFC as well as cognitive functions associated with this region, in part, by increasing the release of glutamate, thereby stimulating postsynaptic non-NMDA glutamate receptors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cognitive, behavioral, and mood effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, such as phencyclidine and ketamine, have been used to study the effects of NMDA receptor dysfunction. Pharmacological modulation of the effects of NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, may lead to development of novel therapeutic agents for psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia. Preclinical studies indicate that some ketamine effects may be mediated through increased glutamate release. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that lamotrigine, a drug reported to inhibit glutamate release, will reduce the neuropsychiatric effects of ketamine in humans.
METHOD: Healthy subjects (n = 16) completed 4 test days involving the administration of lamotrigine, 300 mg by mouth, or placebo 2 hours prior to administration of ketamine (0.26 mg/kg by intravenous bolus and 0.65 mg/kg per hour by intravenous infusion) or placebo in a randomized order under double-blind conditions. Behavioral and cognitive assessments were performed at baseline and after administration of the medications.
RESULTS: Lamotrigine significantly decreased ketamine-induced perceptual abnormalities as assessed by the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (P{\textless}.001); positive symptoms of schizophrenia as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale positive symptoms subscale (P{\textless}.001); negative symptoms as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale negative symptoms subscale (P{\textless}.05); and learning and memory impairment as assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (P{\textless}.05). However, lamotrigine increased the immediate mood-elevating effects of ketamine (P{\textless}.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Glutamate release-inhibiting drugs may reduce the hyperglutamatergic consequences of NMDA receptor dysfunction implicated in the pathophysiologic processes of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia. Further study is needed.},

	abstract = {, Indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT) is
a Class 1 transmethylation enzyme known for its production of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a hallucinogen
with affinity for various serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic,
dopaminergic, and sigma-1 receptors. DMT is produced via the action
of INMT on the endogenous substrates tryptamine and S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM). The biological, biochemical,
and selective small molecule regulation of INMT enzyme activity remain
largely unknown. Kinetic mechanisms for inhibition of rabbit lung
INMT (rabINMT) by the product, DMT, and by a new novel tryptamine
derivative were determined. After Michaelis–Menten and Lineweaver–Burk
analyses had been applied to study inhibition, DMT was found to be
a mixed competitive and noncompetitive inhibitor when measured against
tryptamine. The novel tryptamine derivative, N-[2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]-N′,N′-dimethylpropane-1,3-diamine (propyl dimethyl amino tryptamine
or PDAT), was shown to inhibit rabINMT by a pure noncompetitive mechanism
when measured against tryptamine with a Ki of 84 μM. No inhibition by PDAT was observed at 2 mM when
it was tested against structurally similar Class 1 methyltransferases,
such as human phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase
(hPNMT) and human nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase
(hNNMT), indicating selectivity for INMT. The demonstration of noncompetitive
mechanisms for INMT inhibition implies the presence of an inhibitory
allosteric site. In silico analyses using the computer
modeling software Autodock and the rabINMT sequence threaded onto
the human INMT (hINMT) structure (Protein Data Bank entry 2A14) identified an N-terminal
helix–loop–helix non-active site binding region of the
enzyme. The energies for binding of DMT and PDAT to this region of
rabINMT, as determined by Autodock, were −6.34 and −7.58
kcal/mol, respectively. Assessment of the allosteric control of INMT
may illuminate new biochemical pathway(s) underlying the biology of
INMT.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Abnormalities of serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes have been observed in the postmortem brains of adult suicide victims; however, their role in teenage suicide is unexplored. The authors examined whether 5-HT(2A) receptor subtypes are altered in the postmortem brains of teenage suicide victims.
METHOD: Levels of 5-HT(2A) receptors were determined through examination of [(125)I] LSD binding, protein expression (by use of Western blotting with a specific 5-HT(2A) receptor antibody), and mRNA (by means of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens of 15 teenage suicide victims and 15 normal matched teenage subjects. The cellular localization of the 5-HT(2A) receptors was determined by means of gold immunolabeling.
RESULTS: The authors observed significantly higher [(125)I]LSD binding in the prefrontal cortex and greater protein expression and mRNA levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus but not in the nucleus accumbens of suicide victims, compared with normal subjects. Greater protein expression was localized on pyramidal cells in cortical layer V but not in other cortical layers or in the surrounding neuropil of the prefrontal cortex of teenage suicide victims.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence indicates higher levels of 5-HT(2A) receptor, protein, and mRNA expression in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, which have been implicated in emotion, stress, and cognition. There was no higher level in the nucleus accumbens, which has been implicated in drug dependence and craving. Our findings suggest that a higher level of 5-HT(2A) receptors may be one of the neurobiological abnormalities associated with teenage suicide.},

Samples for fibroblast culture were obtained from patients with major depression with or without melancholia, and normal controls. Dose response curves were determined for 5-HT-induced PI hydrolysis. PI response was determined for bradykinin and l-α-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), alternative Gq-coupled receptor agonists. [125I]LSD binding for 5-HT2A also was conducted. Finally, Western blot analysis was performed for phospholipase Cβ1 (PLCβ1) and Gαq/11 proteins. The maximum PI response observed with 5-HT was significantly lower in melancholics but not nonmelancholic patients relative to controls. Activation of PI hydrolysis by bradykinin and LPA was not reduced in melancholic vs melancholics and controls; responses to both agonists actually were increased in the melancholic group. [125I]LSD binding, PLCβ1, and Gαq/11 protein levels did not differ between groups. The data raise the possibility that the reduced 5-HT2A receptor-induced PI hydrolysis is intrinsic to the receptor itself or its coupling to Gq protein, and is not related to altered availability of the 5-HT2A receptor, Gq or PLC.},

	abstract = {Background
Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor antidepressants raise levels of multiple monoamines, whereas the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) only raise extracellular serotonin. Despite this advantage of MAO-A inhibitors, there is much less frequent development of MAO inhibitors compared with SSRIs. We sought to measure brain MAO-A occupancy after 6 weeks of treatment in depressed patients with a clinically effective dose of a selective MAO-A inhibitor and measure MAO-A occupancy after repeated administration of St. John’s wort, an herb purported to have MAO-A inhibitor properties.

Methods
Participants underwent 2 [11C]-harmine positron emission tomography scans. Healthy controls completed a test–retest condition, and depressed patients were scanned before and after repeated administration of moclobemide or St. John’s wort for 6 weeks at the assigned dose. We measured MAO-A VT, an index of MAO-A density, in the prefrontal, anterior cingulate and anterior temporal cortices, putamen, thalamus, midbrain and hippocampus.

Results
We included 23 participants (10 controls and 13 patients with major depressive disorder [MDD]) in our study. Monoamine oxidase A VT decreased significantly throughout all regions after moclobemide treatment in patients with MDD compared with controls (repeated-measures analysis of variance, F1,15 = 71.08–130.06, p {\textless} 0.001 for all regions, mean occupancy 74\% [standard deviation 6\%]). Treatment with St. John’s wort did not significantly alter MAO-A VT.

Limitations
The occupancy estimates are limited by the sample size of each treatment group; hence, our estimate for the overall moclobemide occupancy of 74\% has a 95\% confidence interval of 70\%–78\%, and we can estimate with 95\% certainty that the occupancy of St. John’s wort is less than 5\%.

Conclusion
For new MAO-A inhibitors, about 74\% occupancy at steady-state dosing is desirable. Consistent with this, St. John’s wort should not be classified as an MAO-A inhibitor. The magnitude of MAO-A blockade during moclobemide treatment exceeds the elevation of MAO-A binding during illness by at least 30\%, suggesting that the treatment effect should exceed the disease effect when designing selective anti-depressants for this target.},

Typically it is assumed that action on the 5-HT2a receptor is the mechanism underlying these psychedelic experiences. In addition, other studies have shown associations between dissociative states and biological parameters (heart rate, cortisol), which are elevated by MDMA. In order to investigate the role of the 5-HT2 receptor in the MDMA-induced dissociative state and the association with biological parameters, a placebo-controlled within-subject study was conducted including a single oral dose of MDMA (75 mg), combined with placebo or a single oral dose of the 5-HT2 receptor blocker ketanserin (40 mg). Twenty healthy recreational MDMA users filled out a dissociative states scale (CADSS) 90 minutes after treatments, which was preceded and followed by assessment of a number of biological parameters (cortisol levels, heart rate, MDMA blood concentrations). Findings showed that MDMA induced a dissociative state but this effect was not counteracted by pre-treatment with ketanserin. Heart rate was the only biological parameter that correlated with the MDMA-induced dissociative state, but an absence of correlation between these measures when participants were pretreated with ketanserin suggests an absence of directional effects of heart rate on dissociative state. It is suggested that the 5-HT2 receptor does not mediate the dissociative effects caused by a single dose of MDMA. Further research is needed to determine the exact neurobiology underlying this effect and whether these effects contribute to the therapeutic potential of MDMA.},

	abstract = {Marijuana impairs learning and memory through actions of its psychoactive constituent, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), in the hippocampus, through activation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1R). CB1Rs are found on glutamate and GABA neuron axon terminals in the hippocampus where they control neurotransmitter release. Previous studies suggest that Δ9-THC is a partial agonist of CB1Rs on glutamate axon terminals in the hippocampus, whereas its effects on GABA terminals have not been described. Using whole-cell electrophysiology in brain slices from C57BL6/J mice, we examined Δ9-THC effects on synaptic GABA IPSCs, and postsynaptic GABA currents elicited by laser-induced photo-uncaging (photolysis) of α-carboxy-2-nitrobenzyl (CNB) caged GABA. Despite robust inhibition of synaptic IPSCs in wildtype mice by the full synthetic agonist WIN55,212-2, using a Tween-80 and DMSO vehicle, Δ9-THC had no effects on IPSCs in this, or in a low concentration of another vehicle, randomly-methylated β-cyclodextrin (RAMEB, 0.023\%). However, IPSCs were inhibited by Δ9-THC in 0.1\% RAMEB, but not in neurons from CB1R knockout mice. Whereas Δ9-THC did not affect photolysis-evoked GABA currents, these responses were prolonged by a GABA uptake inhibitor. Concentration-response curves revealed that the maximal effects of Δ9-THC and WIN55,212-2 were similar, indicating that Δ9-THC is a full agonists at CB1Rs on GABA axon terminals. These results suggest that Δ9-THC inhibits GABA release but does not directly alter GABAA receptors or GABA uptake in the hippocampus. Furthermore, full agonist effects of Δ9-THC on IPSCs likely result from a much higher expression of CB1Rs on GABA versus glutamate axon terminals in the hippocampus.},

	abstract = {The recreational use of cannabis can have persistent adverse effects on mental health. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and most, if not all, of the effects associated with the use of cannabis are caused by THC. Recent studies have suggested a possible protective effect of another cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD). A literature search was performed in the bibliographic databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science using the keyword “cannabidiol.” After removing duplicate entries, 1295 unique titles remained. Based on the titles and abstracts, an initial selection was made. The reference lists of the publications identified in this manner were examined for additional references. Cannabis is not a safe drug. Depending on how often someone uses, the age of onset, the potency of the cannabis that is used and someone’s individual sensitivity, the recreational use of cannabis may cause permanent psychological disorders. Most recreational users will never be faced with such persistent mental illness, but in some individuals cannabis use leads to undesirable effects: cognitive impairment, anxiety, paranoia, and increased risks of developing chronic psychosis or drug addiction. Studies examining the protective effects of CBD have shown that CBD can counteract the negative effects of THC. However, the question remains of how the laboratory results translate to the types of cannabis that are encountered by real-world recreational users.},

	abstract = {The analgesic effect of opioids is enhanced, and tolerance is attenuated, by ultra-low doses (nanomolar to picomolar) of an opioid antagonist, an effect that is mediated by preventing the receptor from coupling to Gs proteins. Recently, we demonstrated a cannabinoid-opioid interaction at the ultra-low dose level, suggesting that the effect might not be specific to opioid receptors. The purpose of this study was to examine, both behaviorally and mechanistically, whether the cannabinoid CB1 receptor was also sensitive to ultra-low dose effects. Antinociception was tested in rats after an injection of either vehicle, the CB1 receptor agonist WIN 55 212-2 (WIN), an ultra-low dose of the CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant (SR 141716), or a combination of WIN and the ultra-low-dose rimonabant. In the acute experiment, tail-flick latencies were recorded at 10-min intervals for 90 min; in the chronic experiment, tail-flick latencies were recorded 10 min after a daily injection over 7 days. Ultra-low dose rimonabant extended the duration of WIN-induced antinociception. WIN produced maximal tolerance by day 7, whereas WIN+ultra-low dose rimonabant continued to produce strong antinociception, demonstrating that ultra-low dose rimonabant prevented the development of WIN-induced tolerance. Animals chronically treated with WIN alone had CB1 receptors predominantly coupling to Gs receptors in the striatum, whereas the vehicle, ultra-low dose rimonabant, and WIN+ultra-low dose rimonabant groups had CB1 receptors predominantly coupling to Gi receptors. Cannabinoid-induced tolerance is thus associated with a G protein coupling switch from the inhibitory Gi protein to the excitatory Gs protein, an effect which is prevented by the ultra-low dose rimonabant.},

	abstract = {Ultra-low-dose opioid antagonists enhance opioid analgesia and reduce analgesic tolerance and dependence by preventing a G protein coupling switch (Gi/o to Gs) by the mu opioid receptor (MOR), although the binding site of such ultra-low-dose opioid antagonists was previously unknown. Here we show that with approximately 200-fold higher affinity than for the mu opioid receptor, naloxone binds a pentapeptide segment of the scaffolding protein filamin A, known to interact with the mu opioid receptor, to disrupt its chronic opioid-induced Gs coupling. Naloxone binding to filamin A is demonstrated by the absence of [(3)H]-and FITC-naloxone binding in the melanoma M2 cell line that does not contain filamin or MOR, contrasting with strong [(3)H]naloxone binding to its filamin A-transfected subclone A7 or to immunopurified filamin A. Naloxone binding to A7 cells was displaced by naltrexone but not by morphine, indicating a target distinct from opioid receptors and perhaps unique to naloxone and its analogs. The intracellular location of this binding site was confirmed by FITC-NLX binding in intact A7 cells. Overlapping peptide fragments from c-terminal filamin A revealed filamin A(2561-2565) as the binding site, and an alanine scan of this pentapeptide revealed an essential mid-point lysine. Finally, in organotypic striatal slice cultures, peptide fragments containing filamin A(2561-2565) abolished the prevention by 10 pM naloxone of both the chronic morphine-induced mu opioid receptor-Gs coupling and the downstream cAMP excitatory signal. These results establish filamin A as the target for ultra-low-dose opioid antagonists previously shown to enhance opioid analgesia and to prevent opioid tolerance and dependence.},

	abstract = {Dopamine and endogenous cannabinoids display complex interactions in the basal ganglia. One possible level of interaction is between CB1 cannabinoid and D2 dopamine receptors. Here, we demonstrate that a regulated association of CB1 and D2 receptors profoundly alters CB1 signaling. This provides the first evidence that CB1/D2 receptor complexes exist, are dynamic, and are agonist-regulated with highest complex levels detected when both receptors are stimulated with subsaturating concentrations of agonist. The consequence of this interaction is a differential preference for signaling through a "nonpreferred" G protein. In this case, D2 receptor activation, simultaneously with CB1 receptor stimulation, results in the receptor complex coupling to G alpha s protein in preference to the expected G alpha i/o proteins. The result of this interaction is an increase in the second messenger cAMP, reversing an initial synergistic inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity seen at subthreshold concentrations of cannabinoid agonist. Additionally, a pertussis toxin insensitive component in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 kinases by the cannabinoid agonist CP 55,940 [(1R,3R,4R)-3-[2-hydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-4-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexan-1-ol] is revealed in cells stably expressing both CB1 and D2 receptors. Thus, concurrent receptor stimulation promotes a heterooligomeric receptor complex and an apparent shift of CB1 signaling from a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibition to a partly pertussis toxin-insensitive stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation.},

	abstract = {The main pharmacological effects of marijuana, as well as synthetic and endogenous cannabinoids, are mediated through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including CB(1) and CB(2) receptors. The CB(1) receptor is the major cannabinoid receptor in the central nervous system and has gained increasing interest as a target for drug discovery for treatment of nausea, cachexia, obesity, pain, spasticity, neurodegenerative diseases and mood and substance abuse disorders. Evidence has accumulated to suggest that CB(1) receptors, like other GPCRs, interact with and are regulated by several other proteins beyond the established role of heterotrimeric G-proteins. These proteins, which include the GPCR kinases, beta-arrestins, GPCR-associated sorting proteins, factor associated with neutral sphingomyelinase, other GPCRs (heterodimerization) and the novel cannabinoid receptor-interacting proteins: CRIP(1a/b), are thought to play important roles in the regulation of intracellular trafficking, desensitization, down-regulation, signal transduction and constitutive activity of CB(1) receptors. This review examines CB(1) receptor-interacting proteins, including heterotrimeric G-proteins, but with particular emphasis on non-G-protein entities, that might comprise the CB(1) receptosomal complex. The evidence for direct interaction with CB(1) receptors and potential functional roles of these interacting proteins is discussed, as are future directions and challenges in this field with an emphasis on the possibility of eventually targeting these proteins for drug discovery.},

This study evaluated the effect of ultra-low-dose naloxone infusion on pain intensity after lumbar discectomy in individuals receiving patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, a total of 80 patients scheduled for open discectomy was randomly assigned to receive naloxone (group N) or placebo (group P). After surgery, all patients were connected to a morphine PCA pump. Both groups received 500 mL of normal saline using a continuous infusion pump through a separate intravenous line for 24 hours. However, group N received a total dose of 0.25 μg/kg/h naloxone, which was added to the normal saline infusion. All patients were asked to grade the intensity of their pain, severity of nausea, vomiting, and pruritus on a 0 to 10 visual analog scale before being discharged from the postanesthesia care unit and at 1, 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively.
RESULTS: It was observed that both groups had a statistically significant (P{\textless}0.01) time trend difference for pain, nausea, and pruritus scores. A significant difference was found between the 2 groups in terms of intensity of pain, nausea, and pruritus, with the naloxone group experiencing a lower level in comparison with the placebo group. Moreover, the median (interquartile range) of morphine consumption after surgery for patients who received naloxone was 26 (24.25 to 28) mg, which is significantly (P{\textless}0.001) lower than for the placebo group, which had a median (interquartile range) of 34 (32 to 36) mg.
CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that infusion of ultra-low-dose naloxone (0.25 μg/kg/h) along with morphine PCA can significantly reduce pain intensity, morphine consumption, and opioid-induced nausea and pruritus after lumbar discectomy.},

Ecstasy is often adulterated and contains compounds that increase morbidity and mortality. While users and clinicians commonly assume that products sold as Molly are less-adulterated MDMA products, this has not been tested. Additionally, while pill-testing services are sometimes available at raves, the assumption that these services decrease risky drug use has not been studied. This study analyzed data collected by the pill-testing organization, DanceSafe, from events across the United States from 2010 to 2015. Colorimetric reagent assays identified MDMA in only 60\% of the 529 samples collected. No significant difference in the percentage of samples testing positive for MDMA was determined between Ecstasy and Molly. Individuals were significantly less likely to report intent to use a product if testing did not identify MDMA (relative risk (RR) = 0.56, p = 0.01). Results suggest that Molly is not a less-adulterated substance, and that pill-testing services are a legitimate harm-reduction service that decreases intent to consume potentially dangerous substances and may warrant consideration by legislators for legal protection. Future research should further examine the direct effects of pill-testing services and include more extensive pill-testing methods.},

The activation of the NLRP3 (Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome has been proposed as key point in the brain damage associated with TBI. NLRP3 was tested as potential target for reducing neuronal loss and promoting functional recovery in a mouse model of TBI. Male NLRP3-/- (n = 20) and wild type (n=27) mice were used. A closed TBI model was performed and inflammatory and apoptotic markers were evaluated. A group of WT mice also received BAY 11-7082, a NLRP3 inhibitor, to further evaluate the role of this pathway. At 24 hrs following TBI NLRP3-/- animals demonstrated a preserved cognitive function as compared to WT mice, additionally brain damage was less severe and the inflammatory mediators were reduced in brain lysates. The administration of BAY 11-7082 in WT animals subjected to TBI produced overlapping results. At day 7 histology revealed a more conserved brain structure with reduced damage in TBI NLRP3-/- animals compared to WT. Our data indicate that the NLRP3 pathway might be exploited as molecular target for the short-term sequelae of TBI.},

	abstract = {Cannabinoids, when co-administered with opioids, may enable reduced opioid doses without loss of analgesic efficacy (ie, an opioid-sparing effect). The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to determine the opioid-sparing potential of cannabinoids. Eligible studies included pre-clinical and clinical studies for which the outcome was either analgesia or opioid dose requirements. Clinical studies included controlled studies and case series. We searched Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Medline, and Embase. Nineteen pre-clinical and nine clinical studies met the search criteria. Seventeen of the 19 pre-clinical studies provided evidence of synergistic effects from opioid and cannabinoid co-administration. Our meta-analysis of pre-clinical studies indicated that the median effective dose (ED50) of morphine administered in combination with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) is 3.6 times lower (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.95, 6.76; n=6) than the ED50 of morphine alone. In addition, the ED50 for codeine administered in combination with delta-9-THC was 9.5 times lower (95\% CI 1.6, 57.5, n=2) than the ED50 of codeine alone. One case series (n=3) provided very-low-quality evidence of a reduction in opioid requirements with cannabinoid co-administration. Larger controlled clinical studies showed some clinical benefits of cannabinoids; however, opioid dose changes were rarely reported and mixed findings were observed for analgesia. In summary, pre-clinical studies provide robust evidence of the opioid-sparing effect of cannabinoids, whereas one of the nine clinical studies identified provided very-low-quality evidence of such an effect. Prospective high-quality-controlled clinical trials are required to determine the opioid-sparing effect of cannabinoids.},

Although at a concentration of 10 μM, there were many hits for JJC8-016, binding affinities in the range of its DAT affinity were only observed at the serotonin transporter (SERT), dopamine D2-like, and sigma1 receptors. R-MOD was more selective, but had much lower affinity at the DAT (Ki=3 μM) than JJC8-016 (Ki=116 nM). In rats, systemic administration of R-MOD alone (10–30 mg/kg i.p.) dose-dependently increased locomotor activity and electrical brain-stimulation reward, whereas JJC8-016 (10–30 mg/kg i.p.) did not produce these effects. Strikingly, pretreatment with JJC8-016 dose-dependently inhibited cocaine-enhanced locomotion, cocaine self-administration, and cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior, whereas R-MOD inhibited cocaine-induced reinstatement only at the high dose of 100 mg/kg. Notably, JJC8-016 alone neither altered extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens nor maintained self-administration. It also failed to induce reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. These findings suggest that JJC8-016 is a unique DAT inhibitor that has no cocaine-like abuse potential by itself. Moreover, pretreatment with JJC8-016 significantly inhibits cocaine-taking and cocaine-seeking behavior likely by interfering with cocaine binding to DAT. In addition, off-target actions may also contribute to its potential therapeutic utility in the treatment of cocaine abuse.},

	abstract = {Obesity is considered a public health problem worldwide. Fenofibrate, a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α) agonist, elicits weight loss in animal models. This study aimed to examine the effects of fenofibrate on energy expenditure, body mass (BM) and gene expression of thermogenic factors in brown adipose tissue of diet-induced obese mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a standard chow (SC; 10\% lipids) diet or a high-fat (HF; 50\% lipids) diet for 10 weeks. Afterwards, groups were subdivided as SC, SC-F, HF and HF-F (n = 10, each). Treatment with fenofibrate (100 mg kg(-1) BM mixed into the diet) lasted 5 weeks. Treated groups had reduced final BM compared with their counterparts (p {\textless} 0·05), explained by the increase in energy expenditure, CO2 production and O2 consumption after treatment with fenofibrate (p {\textless} 0·05). Similarly, genes involved in thermogenesis as PPAR-α, PPAR-γ coactivator 1α, nuclear respiratory factor 1, mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), β-3 adrenergic receptor (β3-AR), bone morphogenetic protein 8B and uncoupling protein 1 were significantly expressed in brown adipocytes after the treatment (p {\textless} 0·05). All observations ensure that selective PPAR-α agonist can induce thermogenesis by increasing energy expenditure and enhancing the expression of genes involved in the thermogenic pathway. These results suggest fenofibrate as a coadjutant drug for the treatment of obesity.},

	abstract = {Rationale Renewed interest has been seen in the use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in psychiatric research and practice. The repeated use of LSD leads to tolerance that is believed to result from serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2A receptor downregulation. In rats, daily LSD administration for 4 days decreased frontal cortex 5-HT2A receptor binding. Additionally, a single dose of LSD acutely increased expression of the early growth response genes EGR1 and EGR2 in rat and mouse brains through 5-HT2A receptor stimulation. No human data on the effects of LSD on gene expression has been reported. Therefore, we investigated the effects of single-dose LSD administration on the expression of the 5-HT2A receptor gene (HTR2A) and EGR1-3 genes. Methods mRNA expression levels were analyzed in whole blood as a peripheral biomarker in 15 healthy subjects before and 1.5 and 24 h after the administration of LSD (100 μg) and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Results LSD did not alter the expression of the HTR2A or EGR1-3 genes 1.5 and 24 h after administration compared with placebo. Conclusions No changes were observed in the gene expression of LSD’s primary target receptor gene or genes that are implicated in its downstream effects. Remaining unclear is whether chronic LSD administration alters gene expression in humans.},

	abstract = {Dietary and metabolic therapies have been attempted in a wide variety of neurological diseases, including epilepsy, headache, neurotrauma, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, sleep disorders, brain cancer, autism, pain, and multiple sclerosis. The impetus for using various diets to treat – or at least ameliorate symptoms of – these disorders stems from both a lack of effectiveness of pharmacological therapies, and also the intrinsic appeal of implementing a more “natural” treatment. The enormous spectrum of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the aforementioned diseases would suggest a degree of complexity that cannot be impacted universally by any single dietary treatment. Yet, it is conceivable that alterations in certain dietary constituents could affect the course and impact the outcome of these brain disorders. Further, it is possible that a final common neurometabolic pathway might be influenced by a variety of dietary interventions. The most notable example of a dietary treatment with proven efficacy against a neurological condition is the high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) used in patients with medically intractable epilepsy. While the mechanisms through which the KD works remain unclear, there is now compelling evidence that its efficacy is likely related to the normalization of aberrant energy metabolism. The concept that many neurological conditions are linked pathophysiologically to energy dysregulation could well provide a common research and experimental therapeutics platform, from which the course of several neurological diseases could be favorably influenced by dietary means. Here we provide an overview of studies using the KD in a wide panoply of neurologic disorders in which neuroprotection is an essential component.},

Clinical standardization of these products is hindered by chemical variability depending on honeybee and botanical sources, but different molecules have been isolated and pharmacologically characterized. Major honey bioactives include phenolics, methylglyoxal, royal jelly proteins (MRJPs), and oligosaccharides. In royal jelly there are antimicrobial jelleins and royalisin peptides, immunomodulatory MRJPs, and hydroxy-decenoic acid derivatives, notably 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA), with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, neuromodulatory, metabolic syndrome preventing, and antiaging activities. Propolis contains caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and artepillin C, specific of Brazilian propolis, with antiviral, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. Bee venom consists of toxic peptides like pain-inducing melittin, SK channel blocking apamin, and allergenic phospholipase A2. Bee pollen is vitaminic, contains antioxidant and anti-inflammatory plant phenolics, as well as antiatherosclerotic, antidiabetic, and hypoglycemic flavonoids, unsaturated fatty acids, and sterols. Beeswax is widely used in cosmetics and makeup. Given the importance of drug discovery from natural sources, this review is aimed at providing an exhaustive screening of the bioactive compounds detected in honeybee products and of their curative or adverse biological effects.},

Consequently, it has been noted that decline in cognitive performance in the elderly in domains of reasoning, problem solving skills, attention, processing speed, working memory and episodic memory is a significant societal problem. Despite the enormity of this issue there are relatively few interventions for cognitive ageing. This may be due to our current state of knowledge on biological factors that underpin cognitive ageing. One of the biological contributors to cognitive aging is chronic neuroinflammation. This review will provide an overview of the peripheral and central mechanisms involved in chronic neuroinflammation and how neuroinflammation may be related to age-associated cognitive decline. Plant based extracts including herbal and nutritional supplements with anti-inflammatory properties will be examined in relation to their utility in treating age-related cognitive decline.

As somatodendritic autoreceptors they control the activity of 5-HT neurons, and, as postsynaptic receptors, the activity in terminal areas. Cocaine (COC), amphetamine (AMPH), methamphetamine (METH) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ("Ecstasy", MDMA) are psychostimulant drugs that can lead to addiction-related behavior in humans and in animals. At the neurochemical level, these psychostimulant drugs interact with monoamine transporters and increase extracellular 5-HT, dopamine and noradrenalin activity in the brain. The increase in 5-HT, which, in addition to dopamine, is a core mechanism of action for drug addiction, hyperactivates 5-HT(1A)-Rs. Here, we first review the role of the various 5-HT(1A)-R populations in spontaneous behavior to provide a background to elucidate the contribution of the 5-HT(1A)-Rs to the organization of psychostimulant-induced addiction behavior. The progress achieved in this field shows the fundamental contribution of brain 5-HT(1A)-Rs to virtually all behaviors associated with psychostimulant addiction. Importantly, the contribution of pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT(1A)-Rs can be dissociated and frequently act in opposite directions. We conclude that 5-HT(1A)-autoreceptors mainly facilitate psychostimulant addiction-related behaviors by a limitation of the 5-HT response in terminal areas. Postsynaptic 5-HT(1A)-Rs, in contrast, predominantly inhibit the expression of various addiction-related behaviors directly. In addition, they may also influence the local 5-HT response by feedback mechanisms. The reviewed findings do not only show a crucial role of 5-HT(1A)-Rs in the control of brain 5-HT activity and spontaneous behavior, but also their complex role in the regulation of the psychostimulant-induced 5-HT response and subsequent addiction-related behaviors.},

N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a precursor of glutathione, and it also exerts as an antioxidant. In this study, we investigated the effects of NAC on the behavioral changes (hyperlocomotion and development of sensitization) and neurotoxicity in male Wistar rats after administration of MAP. Pretreatment with NAC (30, 100 or 300 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated significantly hyperlocomotion in rats induced by a single administration of MAP (2 mg/kg, i.p.), in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, pretreatment with NAC (100 mg/kg, i.p., 15 min before MAP injection, once daily for 5 consecutive days) blocked significantly the development of behavioral sensitization in rats after repeated administration of MAP (2 mg/kg, once daily for 5 consecutive days), whereas the behaviors in rats after repeated administration of NAC plus saline groups were not different from those of control (vehicle plus saline) groups. One week after administration of MAP (7.5 mg/kg x 4, 2-h intervals), levels of dopamine (DA) in rat striatum were significantly decreased as compared with control groups. Pretreatment with NAC (1, 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before each MAP injection) attenuated significantly the MAP-induced reduction of DA in rat striatum, in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that NAC could prevent the behavioral changes (acute hyperlocomotion and development of behavioral sensitization) in rats and neurotoxicity in rat striatum after administration of MAP, and that NAC would be a useful drug for treatment of several symptoms associated with MAP abuse.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: 4-Thio-substituted phenethylamines (2C-T drugs) are potent psychedelics with poorly defined pharmacological properties. Because of their psychedelic effects, 2C-T drugs are sometimes sold as new psychoactive substances (NPSs). The aim of the present study was to characterize the monoamine receptor and transporter interaction profiles of a series of 2C-T drugs.
METHODS: We determined the binding affinities of 2C-T drugs at monoamine receptors and transporters in human cells that were transfected with the respective receptors or transporters. We also investigated the functional activation of serotonergic 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) and 5-HT2B receptors, activation of human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), and inhibition of monoamine uptake transporters.
RESULTS: 2C-T drugs had high affinity for 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors (1-54 nM and 40-350 nM, respectively). With activation potencies of 1-53 nM and 44-370 nM, the drugs were potent 5-HT2A receptor and 5-HT2B receptor, respectively, partial agonists. An exception to this were the benzylthiophenethylamines, which did not potently activate the 5-HT2B receptor (EC50 {\textgreater} 3000 nM). Furthermore, the compounds bound to serotonergic 5-HT1A and adrenergic receptors. The compounds had high affinity for the rat TAAR1 (5-68 nM) and interacted with the mouse but not human TAAR1. The 2C-T drugs did not potently interact with monoamine transporters (Ki {\textgreater} 4000 nM).
CONCLUSION: The receptor binding profile of 2C-T drugs predicts psychedelic effects that are mediated by potent 5-HT2 receptor interactions.},

	abstract = {Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the body and hence GABA-mediated neurotransmission regulates many physiological functions, including those in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. GABA is located throughout the GI tract and is found in enteric nerves as well as in endocrine-like cells, implicating GABA as both a neurotransmitter and an endocrine mediator influencing GI function. GABA mediates its effects via GABA receptors which are either ionotropic GABAA or metabotropic GABAB. The latter which respond to the agonist baclofen have been least characterised, however accumulating data suggest that they play a key role in GI function in health and disease. Like GABA, GABAB receptors have been detected throughout the gut of several species in the enteric nervous system, muscle and epithelial layers as well as on endocrine-like cells. Such widespread distribution of this metabotropic GABA receptor is consistent with its significant modulatory role over intestinal motility, gastric emptying and acid secretion, transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation and visceral sensation of painful colonic stimuli. More intriguing findings, the mechanisms underlying which have yet to be determined, suggest GABAB receptors inhibit GI carcinogenesis and tumour growth. Therefore, the diversity of GI functions regulated by GABAB receptors makes it a potentially useful target in the treatment of several GI disorders. In light of the development of novel compounds such as peripherally acting GABAB receptor agonists, positive allosteric modulators of the GABAB receptor and GABA producing enteric bacteria, we review and summarize current knowledge on the function of GABAB receptors within the GI tract.},

	abstract = {The limited effectiveness of current therapies against Alzheimer’s disease highlights the need for intensifying research efforts devoted to developing new agents for preventing or retarding the disease process. During the last few years, targeting the endogenous cannabinoid system has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach to treat Alzheimer. The endocannabinoid system is composed by a number of cannabinoid receptors, including the well-characterized CB1 and CB2 receptors, with their endogenous ligands and the enzymes related to the synthesis and degradation of these endocannabinoid compounds. Several findings indicate that the activation of both CB1 and CB2 receptors by natural or synthetic agonists, at non-psychoactive doses, have beneficial effects in Alzheimer experimental models by reducing the harmful A peptide action and tau phosphorylation, as well as by promoting the brain’s intrinsic repair mechanisms. Moreover, endocannabinoid signaling has been demonstrated to modulate numerous concomitant pathological processes, including neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. The present paper summarizes the main experimental studies demonstrating the polyvalent properties of cannabinoid compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, which together encourage progress towards a clinical trial.},

	abstract = {The state of consciousness induced by N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is one of the most extraordinary of any naturally-occurring psychedelic substance. Users consistently report the complete replacement of normal subjective experience with a novel “alternate universe,” often densely populated with a variety of strange objects and other highly complex visual content, including what appear to be sentient “beings.” The phenomenology of the DMT state is of great interest to psychology and calls for rigorous academic enquiry. The extremely short duration of DMT effects—less than 20 minutes—militates against single dose administration as the ideal model for such enquiry. Using pharmacokinetic modelling and DMT blood sampling data, we demonstrate that the unique pharmacological characteristics of DMT, which also include a rapid onset and lack of acute tolerance to its subjective effects, make it amenable to administration by target-controlled intravenous infusion. This is a technology developed to maintain a stable brain concentration of anaesthetic drugs during surgery. Simulations of our model demonstrate that this approach will allow research subjects to be induced into a stable and prolonged DMT experience, making it possible to carefully observe its psychological contents, and provide more extensive accounts for subsequent analyses. This model would also be valuable in performing functional neuroimaging, where subjects are required to remain under the influence of the drug for extended periods. Finally, target-controlled intravenous infusion of DMT may aid the development of unique psychotherapeutic applications of this psychedelic agent.},

Since then, resveratrol has been broadly studied and shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic effects, with those on oxidative stress possibly being most important and underlying some of the others, but many signaling pathways are among the molecular targets of resveratrol. In concert they may be beneficial in many disorders, particularly in diseases where oxidative stress plays an important role. The main focus of this review will be the pathways affected by resveratrol. Based on these mechanistic considertions, the involvement of resveratrol especially in cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and possibly in longevity will be is addressed.},

Anti-tobacco media campaigns and control programs have significantly reduced smoking in the United States, yet trends for menthol cigarette smoking have not been as promising. Menthol cigarette smoking is particularly prevalent among young adults and African Americans, with implications for long-term impacts on health care. Continuing high rates of menthol cigarette addiction call into question the role of menthol in nicotine addiction. To date, a biological basis for the high rate of addiction and relapse among menthol cigarette smokers has not been defined. Studies have demonstrated a role for menthol in the metabolism of nicotine in the body. More recent findings now reveal an interaction between menthol and the nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptor in cells. This receptor is central to the actions of nicotine in the brain, and plays an important role in nicotine addiction. The newly discovered effect of menthol on nACh receptors may begin to explain the unique addictive properties of menthol cigarettes.},

However, it is unknown if mTOR inhibition affects aging or its consequences in humans. To begin to assess the effects of mTOR inhibition on human aging-related conditions, we evaluated whether the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 ameliorated immunosenescence (the decline in immune function during aging) in elderly volunteers, as assessed by their response to influenza vaccination. RAD001 enhanced the response to the influenza vaccine by about 20\% at doses that were relatively well tolerated. RAD001 also reduced the percentage of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes expressing the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor, which inhibits T cell signaling and is more highly expressed with age. These results raise the possibility that mTOR inhibition may have beneficial effects on immunosenescence in the elderly.

	abstract = {Repeated daily treatments of perinatal rats with the dopamine D2-receptor (D2-R) agonist quinpirole for a week or more produces the phenomenon of ‘priming’—gradual but long-term sensitization of D2-R. In fact a daily dose of quinpirole as low as 50 µg/kg/day is adequate for sensitizing D2-R. Primed rats as neonates and in adolescence, when acutely treated with quinpirole display enhanced eating/gnawing/nursing on dams, also horizontal locomotor activity. Between 3 and 5 weeks of age, acute quinpirole treatment of primed rats produces profound vertical jumping with paw treading—a behavior that is not observed in control rats. At later ages acute quinpirole treatment is associated with enhanced yawning, a D2-R-associated behavior. This long-term D2-R supersensitivity is believed to be life-long, despite the relatively brief period of D2-R priming near the time of birth. D2-R supersensitivity is not associated with an increase in the number or affinity of D2-R, as assessed in the striatum of rats; nor is it induced with the D3-R agonist 7-OH-DPAT. However, quinpirole-induced D2-R supersensitivity is associated with cognitive deficits, also a deficit in pre-pulse inhibition and in neurotrophic factors, and low levels of the transcript regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) RGS9 in brain; and acute reversal of these alterations by the antipsychotic agent olanzapine. In sum, rats ontogenetically D2-R supersensitized have face validity, construct validity and predictive ability for schizophrenia.},

Necroptosis, a programmed form of necrosis, is executed by the mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein, which is triggered by receptor-interactive protein kinases (RIPK) 1 and 3. We found that necroptosis was activated in postmortem human AD brains, positively correlated with Braak stage, and inversely correlated with brain weight and cognitive scores. In addition, we found that the set of genes regulated by RIPK1 overlapped significantly with multiple independent AD transcriptomic signatures, indicating that RIPK1 activity could explain a substantial portion of transcriptomic changes in AD. Furthermore, we observed that lowering necroptosis activation reduced cell loss in a mouse model of AD. We anticipate that our findings will spur a new area of research in the AD field focused on developing new therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking its activation.},

Employing a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, the cognitive, subjective, and cardiovascular effects produced by oral THC (20 mg) administration were determined twice in the same cannabis users: once after treatment with placebo and once after treatment with guanfacine (3 mg/day). Compared with performance at baseline, THC negatively affected accuracy on spatial working memory trials while participants were maintained on placebo (p=0.012) but not guanfacine (p=0.497); compared with placebo, accuracy was significantly (p=0.003, Cohen's d=-0.640) improved while individuals were treated with guanfacine. Similarly, compared with baseline, THC increased omission errors on an attentional task while participants were maintained on placebo (p=0.017) but not on guanfacine (p=0.709); compared with placebo, there were significantly (p=0.034, Cohen's d=0.838) fewer omissions while individuals were maintained on guanfacine.

The impact of MDD is compounded by the limited therapeutic efficacy and delay of weeks to months of currently available medications. These issues highlight the need for more efficacious and faster-acting treatments to alleviate the burdens of MDD. Recent breakthroughs demonstrate that certain drugs, including ketamine and scopolamine, produce rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effects in MDD patients. Moreover, preclinical work has shown that the antidepressant actions of ketamine and scopolamine in rodent models are caused by an increase of extracellular glutamate, elevated BDNF, activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) cascade, and increased number and function of spine synapses in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here we review studies showing that both ketamine and scopolamine elicit rapid antidepressant effects through converging molecular and cellular mechanisms in the PFC. In addition, we discuss evidence that selective antagonists of NMDA and muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptor subtypes (i.e., NR2B and M1-AChR) in the PFC produce comparable antidepressant responses. Furthermore, we discuss evidence that ketamine and scopolamine antagonize inhibitory interneurons in the PFC leading to disinhibition of pyramidal neurons and increased extracellular glutamate that promotes the rapid antidepressant responses to these agents. Collectively, these studies indicate that specific NMDA and mACh receptor subtypes on GABAergic interneurons are promising targets for novel rapid-acting antidepressant therapies.},

Intranasal insulin-like growth factor-I, deferoxamine, and erythropoietin have been shown to protect the brain against stroke in animal models. Intranasal delivery has been used to target the neuroprotective peptide NAP to the brain to treat neurodegeneration. Intranasal fibroblast growth factor-2 and epidermal growth factor have been shown to stimulate neurogenesis in adult animals. Intranasal insulin improves memory, attention, and functioning in patients with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, and even improves memory and mood in normal adult humans. This new method of delivery can revolutionize the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and other brain disorders.},

However, the deficits in mental state attribution are somehow opposed: Whereas patients with SCZ tend to over-attribute intentions to agents and physical events ("hyper-intentionality"), patients with autism treat people as devoid of intentions ("hypo-intentionality"). Here we aimed to investigate whether this hypo-hyper-intentionality hypothesis can be supported by neural evidence during a mentalizing task. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the neural responses and functional connectivity during reading others intention. Scanning was performed in 23 individuals with ASD, 18 with paranoid SCZ and 23 gender and IQ matched control subjects. Both clinical groups showed reduced brain activation compared to controls for the contrast intentional vs physical information processing in left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) for SCZ, and right pSTS in ASD. As predicted, these effects were caused in a group specific way: Relative increased activation for physical information processing in SCZ that was also correlated with positive PANNS score and relative decreased activation for intentional information processing in ASD. Additionally, we could demonstrate opposed connectivity patterns between the right pSTS and vMPFC in the clinical groups, ie, increased for SCZ, decreased for ASD. These findings represent opposed neural signatures in key regions of the social brain as predicted by the hyper-hypo-intentionality hypothesis.},

This innervation regulates cortical functioning by activating multiple serotonin receptors that are differentially expressed by pyramidal cells and interneurons. Electrophysiological studies in the prefrontal cortex indicate that receptors of the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A subtypes are the main serotonin receptors regulating membrane excitability in pyramidal cells. Most pyramidal cells in layer V coexpress 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors that together regulate how these neurons encode excitatory input into neuronal firing. In contrast, a subset of large pyramidal cells of deep layer V appears to express exclusively 5-HT2A receptors that depolarize and excite these cells. Serotonin also depolarizes and excites at least two classes of GABAergic interneurons by acting on 5-HT3 and 5-HT2A receptors. The differential expression of serotonin receptors in different pyramidal cells and interneurons is consistent with a growing appreciation of the anatomical, molecular and functional heterogeneity of pyramidal cells and interneurons of the cerebral cortex. These find ings begin to lay the ground for a cellular-level understanding of the serotonergic regulation of the prefrontal cortex.},

	abstract = {We examined the in vivo effects of the hallucinogen 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (DOI). DOI suppressed the firing rate of 7 of 12 dorsal raphe (DR) serotonergic (5-HT) neurons and partially inhibited the rest (ED50 = 20 μg/kg, i.v.), an effect reversed by M100907 (5-HT2A antagonist) and picrotoxinin (GABAA antagonist). DOI (1 mg/kg, s.c.) reduced the 5-HT release in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to 33 ± 8\% of baseline, an effect also antagonized by M100907. However, the local application of DOI in the mPFC increased 5-HT release (164 ± 6\% at 100 μm), an effect antagonized by tetrodotoxin, M100907, and BAY × 3702 (5-HT1A agonist) but not by SB 242084 (5-HT2C antagonist). The 5-HT increase was also reversed by NBQX (AMPA–KA antagonist) and 1S,3S-ACPD (mGluR 2/3 agonist) but not by MK-801 (NMDA antagonist). AMPA mimicked the 5-HT elevation produced by DOI. Likewise, the electrical–chemical stimulation of thalamocortical afferents and the local inhibition of glutamate uptake increased the 5-HT release through AMPA receptors. DOI application in mPFC increased the firing rate of a subgroup of 5-HT neurons (5 of 10), indicating an enhanced output of pyramidal neurons. Dual-label fluorescence confocal microscopic studies demonstrated colocalization of 5-HT1Aand 5-HT2A receptors on individual cortical pyramidal neurons.
Thus, DOI reduces the activity of ascending 5-HT neurons through a DR-based action and enhances serotonergic and glutamatergic transmission in mPFC through 5-HT2A and AMPA receptors. Because pyramidal neurons coexpress 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, DOI disrupts the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs and leads to an increased activity that may mediate its hallucinogenic action.},

Much progress has been made in recent years in understanding how central nervous system (CNS) serotonin systems acting through a diverse array of serotonin receptors impact feeding behavior and metabolism. Particular attention has been paid to mechanisms through which serotonin impacts energy balance pathways within the hypothalamus. How upstream factors relevant to energy balance regulate the release of hypothalamic serotonin is less clear, but work addressing this issue is underway. Generally, investigation into the central serotonergic regulation of energy balance has had a predominantly “hypothalamocentric” focus, yet non-hypothalamic structures that have been implicated in energy balance regulation also receive serotonergic innervation and express multiple subtypes of serotonin receptors. Moreover, there is a growing appreciation of the diverse mechanisms through which peripheral serotonin impacts energy balance regulation. Clearly, the serotonergic regulation of energy balance is a field characterized by both rapid advances and by an extensive and diverse set of central and peripheral mechanisms yet to be delineated.},

	abstract = {Social cognition critically impacts the development, progression, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, social cognition skills are insufficiently targeted by current treatment approaches. By applying a multimodal brain imaging strategy, the present study demonstrated the importance of the serotonin 2A/1A receptor system in the modulation of social exclusion processing. Understanding the biochemical underpinnings of the social rejection experience is important for increasing our knowledge about social/emotional processing and the related neural responses. The identification of relevant neural responses is in turn crucial for the efficacious management of disorders influenced by social factors. Our findings may help to diminish a knowledge gap that currently restrains the development of pharmacotherapies for sociocognitive deficits in psychiatric disorders., Social ties are crucial for physical and mental health. However, psychiatric patients frequently encounter social rejection. Moreover, an increased reactivity to social exclusion influences the development, progression, and treatment of various psychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, the neuromodulatory substrates of rejection experiences are largely unknown. The preferential serotonin (5-HT) 2A/1A receptor agonist, psilocybin (Psi), reduces the processing of negative stimuli, but whether 5-HT2A/1A receptor stimulation modulates the processing of negative social interactions remains unclear. Therefore, this double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over study assessed the neural response to social exclusion after the acute administration of Psi (0.215 mg/kg) or placebo (Pla) in 21 healthy volunteers by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting-state magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Participants reported a reduced feeling of social exclusion after Psi vs. Pla administration, and the neural response to social exclusion was decreased in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the middle frontal gyrus, key regions for social pain processing. The reduced neural response in the dACC was significantly correlated with Psi-induced changes in self-processing and decreased aspartate (Asp) content. In conclusion, 5-HT2A/1A receptor stimulation with psilocybin seems to reduce social pain processing in association with changes in self-experience. These findings may be relevant to the normalization of negative social interaction processing in psychiatric disorders characterized by increased rejection sensitivity. The current results also emphasize the importance of 5-HT2A/1A receptor subtypes and the Asp system in the control of social functioning, and as prospective targets in the treatment of sociocognitive impairments in psychiatric illnesses.},

Each mouse model consistently displayed acceleration of ageing-like physiological changes or a shortened lifespan. Conversely, ageing retardation and lifespan extension were achieved in mid-aged mice that were locally implanted with healthy hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells that had been genetically engineered to survive in the ageing-related hypothalamic inflammatory microenvironment. Mechanistically, hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells contributed greatly to exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) in the cerebrospinal fluid, and these exosomal miRNAs declined during ageing, whereas central treatment with healthy hypothalamic stem/progenitor cell-secreted exosomes led to the slowing of ageing. In conclusion, ageing speed is substantially controlled by hypothalamic stem cells, partially through the release of exosomal miRNAs.},

	abstract = {This study was designed to quantitatively evaluate the health benefits of a multivitamin, multimineral, herbal, essential oil–infused supplement using serum biomarkers. We also qualitatively evaluated the health effects of this supplement using a survey. Sixteen participants were recruited to take the supplement as directed for two months. The levels of the following serum components were measured in the participants: total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, total/HDL cholesterol ratio, ferritin, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, insulin, testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, free androgen index, red blood cell magnesium, homocysteine, coenzyme Q10, lipid peroxides, alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, cardiovascular index, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), arachidonic acid (AA), and the AA/EPA ratio. The following markers were significantly improved (p {\textless}.05) after two months of supplementation: HDL cholesterol, LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, fasting insulin, homocysteine, serum vitamin E, EPA, and the AA/EPA ratio. These findings demonstrate that the supplementation had significant positive effects on biochemical indicators of cardiovascular health, antioxidant status, inflammation, and blood glucose regulation. All of the outcomes in the 16-item qualitative survey were improved after two months of supplementation. Twelve of these outcomes were significantly improved. The participants reported more mental clarity, energy, motivation, control, balance, and happiness, while reporting less back pain, muscle pain, cold and flu incidence, anxiety, frustration, and irritation at the end of the two-month supplementation period. Although definite clinical efficacy remains elusive, these results suggest that the supplement may provide a broad range of health benefits for users in a short period.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To study the effect of specially formulated high-fat simple carbohydrate diet (HFSC) on the serotonin metabolic pathway in male C57BL/6J mice.Methods: Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that specially formulated HFSC induces metabolic syndrome in C57BL/6J mice. In the present investigation, 5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were analyzed in two brain regions (hypothalamus, corpus striatum), urine and plasma of HFSC-fed mice on a monthly basis up to 5 months using high-performance liquid chromatography fitted with electrochemical detector. The data were analyzed using Graph pad Prism v7.3 by two-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukeyâ€™s test (to assess the effect of time on the serotonergic metabolic pathway).Results: HFSC feed was observed to lower the hypothalamic serotonergic tone as compared to the age-matched control-fed C57BL/6J mice. Although the hypothalamic serotonergic tone was unaltered over time due to consumption of diet per se, hypothalamic 5-HTP levels were observed to be lower on consumption of HFSC feed over duration of 5 months as compared to 1st month of consumption of HFSC feed. The striatal 5-HTP levels were lowered in the HFSC-fed mice after 4 months of feeding as compared to the age-matched control-fed mice. The striatal 5-HTP levels were also lower in both control and HFSC-fed mice due to consumption of the respective diet over a duration of 5 months. Increased plasma 5-HTP levels were observed due to consumption of HFSC feed over duration of 5 months in the HFSC-fed group. However, higher breakdown of serotonin was observed in both the plasma and urine of HFSC-fed C57BL/6J mice as per the turnover studies.Discussion: The central and peripheral serotonergic pathway is affected differentially by both the type of diet consumed and the duration for which the diet is consumed. The hypothalamic, striatal and plasma serotonergic pathway were altered both by the type of feed consumed and the duration of feeding. The urine serotonergic pathway was affected by mainly the duration for which a particular diet was consumed. These findings may have implications in the feeding behavior, cognitive decline and depression associated with metabolic syndrome patients.},

	abstract = {Preclinical and clinical research supports a role for neuroactive steroids in the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We investigated ganaxolone (a synthetic 3Î²-methylated derivative of allopregnanolone, a GABAergic neuroactive steroid) for treatment of PTSD in a proof-of-concept, multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Veteran and non-veteran participants (n = 112) were randomized to ganaxolone or placebo at biweekly escalating doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg twice daily for 6 weeks. During an open-label 6-week extension phase, the initial ganaxolone group continued ganaxolone, while the placebo group crossed over to ganaxolone. Eighty-six and 59 participants, respectively, completed the placebo-controlled and open-label phases. A modified intent-to-treat mixed model repeated measures analysis revealed no significant differences between the effects of ganaxolone and placebo on Clinician Administered PTSD Symptom (CAPS) scores, global well-being, negative mood, or sleep. Dropout rates did not differ between groups, and ganaxolone was generally well tolerated. Trough blood levels of ganaxolone at the end of the double-blind phase were, however, lower than the anticipated therapeutic level of ganaxolone in {\textgreater}35\% of participants on active drug. Pharmacokinetic profiling of the ganaxolone dose regimen used in the trial and adverse event sensitivity analyses suggest that under-dosing may have contributed to the failure of ganaxolone to out-perform placebo. Future investigations of ganaxolone may benefit from higher dosing, rigorous monitoring of dosing adherence, a longer length of placebo-controlled testing, and targeting of treatment to PTSD subpopulations with demonstrably dysregulated pre-treatment neuroactive steroid levels.

	abstract = {RationaleThe ventral tegmental area (VTA) and its projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) are critical for cannabinoid-related motivational effects. Cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R) transmission modulates VTA dopamine (DA) neuron activity and previous reports demonstrate anatomically segregated effects of CB1R transmission in the VTA. However, the underlying pharmacological and anatomical regions responsible for these effects are currently unknown.ObjectivesThe objective of the study is to characterize the motivational effects of localized anterior vs. posterior intra-VTA activation vs. blockade of CB1R transmission and the potential role of intra-BLA and intra-NAc DA transmission in these phenomena.MethodsUsing a conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure, we administered a CB1 agonist (WIN-55,212-2) or antagonist (AM 251) into the posterior VTA (pVTA) or anterior VTA (aVTA) of rats, combined with intra-BLA or intra-NAc DA receptor blockade and intra-VTA co-administration of selective mu vs. kappa opiate-receptor antagonists.ResultsIntra-pVTA CB1R activation produced robust rewarding effects through a mu-opiate receptor mechanism whereas CB1R blockade produced conditioned place aversions (CPA) through a kappa-opiate receptor substrate. In contrast, modulation of aVTA CB1R transmission produced no observable effects. Intra-BLA DA receptor blockade prevented the rewarding effects of pVTA CB1R activation, but had no effects on CB1R blockade-induced aversions. In contrast, intra-NAc DA receptor blockade selectively blocked the aversive effects of pVTA CB1R antagonism.ConclusionsActivation vs. blockade of CB1R transmission in the posterior VTA produces bivalent rewarding or aversive effects through separate mu vs. kappa-opiate receptor substrates. These dissociable effects depend on separate DA receptor transmission substrates in the BLA or NAc, respectively.},

Previous studies have suggested that the cannabinoid 2 (CB$_{\textrm{2}}$) receptor may play a regulatory role on insulin secretion, immune modulation and insulin resistance. Given that diabetes and insulin resistance are attributable to elevated inflammatory tone, we investigated the role of CB$_{\textrm{2}}$ receptor on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet (HFD)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mice. \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} Diabetes was induced in male ICR mice by HFD/STZ and exposed to a CB$_{\textrm{2}}$ receptor agonist, SER601, for 2- or 4-weeks via subcutaneous implantation of osmotic minipumps. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed at the end of treatment. Islets were isolated for assessment of β-cell function. Pancreases and skeletal muscles were also obtained for histological analyses. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} Despite a lack of impact on glucose tolerance, substantial improvement on insulin sensitivity was observed in SER601-treated mice, which could partly be attributed to improved islet β-cell function, shown as increased glucose-induced insulin secretion and insulin content. No changes on islet macrophage infiltration or skeletal muscle fat deposition were detectable from SER601-treated mice. However, a major decrease in body weight was recorded at the end of 4-week SER601 exposure, accompanied by a lack of epididymal adipose mass in SER601-treated mice. \textbf{\textit{Conclusion:}} Our data suggest a lipolytic role of SER601 in HFD/STZ-induced diabetic mice, which results in significant improvement of systemic insulin sensitivity. Thus, the CB$_{\textrm{2}}$ receptor may be considered a promising target for therapeutic development against insulin resistance and obesity-related diabetes.},

A key enzyme involved in the generation of Aβ is the β-secretase BACE, for which powerful inhibitors have been developed and are currently in use in human clinical trials. However, although BACE inhibition can reduce cerebral Aβ levels, whether it also can ameliorate neural circuit and memory impairments remains unclear. Using histochemistry, in vivo Ca2+ imaging, and behavioral analyses in a mouse model of AD, we demonstrate that along with reducing prefibrillary Aβ surrounding plaques, the inhibition of BACE activity can rescue neuronal hyperactivity, impaired long-range circuit function, and memory defects. The functional neuronal impairments reappeared after infusion of soluble Aβ, mechanistically linking Aβ pathology to neuronal and cognitive dysfunction. These data highlight the potential benefits of BACE inhibition for the effective treatment of a wide range of AD-like pathophysiological and cognitive impairments.},

	abstract = {Recent literature has pointed to the existence of inflammasome-mediated inflammatory pathways in central nervous system disorders and associated changes in behavior. Neuroinflammation, which is an innate immune response in the central nervous system against harmful and irritable stimuli such as pathogens and metabolic toxic waste, as well as to chronic mild stress, is mediated by protein complexes known as inflammasomes. Inflammasomes activate pro-inflammatory caspases 1 and 5, which then cleave the precursor forms of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-18 and IL-33 into their active forms. These pro-inflammatory cytokines have been shown to promote a variety of innate immune processes associated with infection, inflammation and autoimmunity, and thereby play an instrumental role in the instigation of neuroinflammation during old age and subsequent occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases, cognitive impairment and dementia. In particular, NLRP inflammasomes may also have a role in the etiologies of depression, Alzheimer’s disease and in metabolic disorders, such as Type II diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases that have been shown to be co-morbid with psychiatric illnesses. It has been reported that while these inflammasomes may be activated through TNF-α dependent pathways, other cytokines, like IFN-γ, may assist in inhibiting their activation and thus delay disease progression. Furthermore some other cytokines, including IL-6, may not have a direct role in inflammasome-mediated diseases. An array of recent research suggests that NLRP inflammasomes targeted therapies could be used for alleviating neuroinflammation and for treatment of associated psychiatric illnesses, although this still remains a challenge and necessitates further extensive research. This review examines the complex inflammatory signaling pathways involved in the activation of NLRP inflammasomes and the role they play in promoting neuroinflammation and subsequent behavioral changes.},

	abstract = {The hypothesis that functionally selective G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists may have enhanced therapeutic benefits has revitalized interest for many GPCR targets. In particular, although κ-opioid receptor (KOR) agonists are analgesic with a low risk of dependence and abuse, their use is limited by a propensity to induce sedation, motor incoordination, hallucinations, and dysphoria-like states. Several laboratories have produced a body of work suggesting that G protein-biased KOR agonists might be analgesic with fewer side effects. Although that has been an intriguing hypothesis, suitable KOR-selective and G protein-biased agonists have not been available to test this idea. Here we provide data using a G protein-biased agonist, RB-64 (22-thiocyanatosalvinorin A), which suggests that KOR-mediated G protein signaling induces analgesia and aversion, whereas β-arrestin-2 signaling may be associated with motor incoordination. Additionally, unlike unbiased KOR agonists, the G protein-biased ligand RB-64 does not induce sedation and does not have anhedonia-like actions, suggesting that a mechanism other than G protein signaling mediates these effects. Our findings provide the first evidence for a highly selective and G protein-biased tool compound for which many, but not all, of the negative side effects of KOR agonists can be minimized by creating G protein-biased KOR agonists.},

Here, we show that amphetamines are bioactivated by CNS prostaglandin H synthase (PHS) to free radical intermediates that cause ROS formation and neurodegenerative oxidative DNA damage. In vitro incubations of purified PHS-1 with 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and methamphetamine (METH) demonstrated PHS-catalyzed time- and concentration-dependent formation of an amphetamine carbon- and/or nitrogen-centered free radical intermediate, and stereoselective oxidative DNA damage, evidenced by 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) formation. Similarly in vivo, MDA and METH caused dose- and time-dependent DNA oxidation in multiple brain regions, remarkably dependent on the regional PHS levels, including the striatum and substantia nigra, wherein neurodegeneration of dopaminergic nerve terminals was evidenced by decreased immunohistochemical staining of tyrosine hydroxylase. Motor impairment using the rotarod test was evident within 3 wk after the last drug dose, and persisted for at least 6 months. Pretreatment with the PHS inhibitor acetylsalicylic acid blocked MDA-initiated DNA oxidation and protected against functional motor impairment for at least 1.5 months after drug treatment. This is the first direct evidence for PHS-catalyzed bioactivation of amphetamines causing temporal and regional differences in CNS oxidative DNA damage directly related to structural and functional neurodegenerative consequences.},

In line with findings suggesting positive effects in the treatment of mental health problems, such research highlights the potential of psychedelic drugs for the enhancement of wellbeing even in healthy individuals. The relatively low risk associated with usage does not appear to align with stringent drug laws that impose heavy penalties for their use. Some policy implications, and suggestions for future research, are considered.},

Our aim was to test the contribution of the harman and norharman in tobacco smoke to MAO-A inhibition from tobacco smoke preparations, as part of a re-examination of harman and norharman as the cause of the inhibition of MAO-A inhibition in the brain. Tobacco smoke particulate matter and cigarette smoke particulate matter were prepared and the amounts of harman and norharman measured. The results were compared with the total monoamine oxidase-A inhibitory activity. At a nicotine concentration of 0.6Î¼M (a "physiological" concentration in blood) the total monoamine oxidase-A inhibitory activity measured in these samples was sufficient to inhibit the enzyme by approximately 10\%. Of this inhibitory activity, only a small proportion of the total was found to be due to harman and norharman. These results show that harman and norharman provide only a moderate contribution to the total monoamine oxidase-A inhibitory activity of tobacco smoke, perhaps under 10\%. This suggests that other inhibitors (either known or unknown) may be more significant contributors to total inhibitory activity than has yet been established, and deserve closer examination.},

The results of clinical studies addressing MDMA's serotonin neurotoxic potential in humans have been inconclusive. In the present study, 23 abstinent MDMA users and 19 non-MDMA controls underwent quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) studies using [11C]McN5652 and [11C]DASB, first- and second-generation serotonin transporter (SERT) ligands previously validated in baboons for detecting MDMA-induced brain serotonin neurotoxicity. Global and regional distribution volumes (DVs) and two additional SERT-binding parameters (DVspec and DVR) were compared in the two subject populations using parametric statistical analyses. Data from PET studies revealed excellent correlations between the various binding parameters of [11C] McN5652 and [11C]DASB, both in individual brain regions and individual subjects. Global SERT reductions were found in MDMA users with both PET ligands, using all three of the above-mentioned SERT-binding parameters. Preplanned comparisons in 15 regions of interest demonstrated reductions in selected cortical and subcortical structures. Exploratory correlational analyses suggested that SERT measures recover with time, and that loss of the SERT is directly associated with MDMA use intensity. These quantitative PET data, obtained using validated first- and second-generation SERT PET ligands, provide strong evidence of reduced SERT density in some recreational MDMA users.},

	abstract = {Studies have consistently reported the participation of free radicals in Bipolar Disorder. Administration of d-amphetamine (d-AMPH) is a relevant animal model of mania and it increases oxidative stress in rat brain. Evidences indicate that the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and Deferoxamine (DFX) exert protective effects in the brain. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of NAC, DFX or their combination on AMPH-induced hyperactivity. The protein oxidation levels were analyzed in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. In the first animal model (reversal treatment), adult male Wistar rats received saline or d-AMPH for 14 days, and from the 8th to the 14th day, they were treated with saline, NAC, DFX, or NAC plus DFX. In the second animal model (prevention treatment), rats were pretreated with saline or antioxidant regime, and from the 8th to the 14th day, they also received saline or d-AMPH. In the prefrontal cortex, the protein carbonyls were not affected by the treatment with antioxidants alone but it was increased by treatment with NAC plus DFX. At the same model, NAC plus DFX reversed the protein damage in the hippocampus, but NAC alone increased this damage. In the prevention treatment, it was observed that the protein damage in the prefrontal cortex was prevented by DFX or NAC plus DFX. In the hippocampus, the pretreatment with all antioxidant regime prevented protein damage induced by d-AMPH. At both treatments (reversal or prevention) the antioxidants did not present any effect against d-AMPH-induced hyperactivity. In conclusion, NAC or DFX and the combination of NAC plus DFX reverse and protect against d-AMPH-induced oxidative protein damage. Using these protocols we could not observe affects on locomotion, however this effect varies depending on the brain region and the treatment regime.},

Prompting this focus are several lines of evidence: 1) altered glutamate and NMDA receptor (NMDAR) expression and functioning; 2) antidepressant effects of NMDAR signaling blockers; 3) interaction between conventional therapeutic regimens and NMDAR signaling modulators; 4) biochemical evidence of interaction between monoaminergic system and NMDAR signaling; 5) interaction between neurotrophic factors and NMDAR signaling in mood regulation; 6) cross-talk between NMDAR signaling and inflammatory processes; and 7) antidepressant effects of a number of NMDA modulators in recent clinical trials. Altogether, these studies establish a warrant for the refinement of novel compounds that target glutamatergic mechanisms for the treatment of MDs.},

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of protein kinase C (PKC) and G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) inhibition on antinociceptive tolerance in vivo to opioid agonists of different efficacy. A rapid (8-h) tolerance-induction model was used where each opioid was repeatedly administered to naive mice. Animals were then challenged with the opioid after injection of a kinase inhibitor to determine its effects on the level of tolerance. Tolerance to meperidine, morphine, or fentanyl was fully reversed by the PKC inhibitor 12-(2-cyanoethyl)-6,7,12,13-tetrahydro-13-methyl-5-oxo-5H-indolo(2,3-a)pyrrolo(3,4-c)carbazole (Gö6976). However, in vivo tolerance to [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) was not reversed by PKC inhibition. The novel small-molecule GRK inhibitors β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 inhibitor and 2-(8-[(dimethylamino) methyl]-6,7,8,9-tetrahydropyridol[1,2-a]indol-3-yl)-3-(1-methylindol-3-yl)maleimide (Ro 32-0432) did not reverse the tolerance to meperidine, fentanyl, or morphine but did reverse the tolerance to DAMGO. To correlate GRK-dependent DAMGO-induced tolerance with μ-opioid receptor desensitization, we used in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recording from mouse locus coeruleus neurons and observed that the GRK inhibitors reduced DAMGO-induced desensitization of μ-opioid receptors, whereas the PKC inhibitor had no effect. These results suggest that tolerance induced by low- and moderate-efficacy μ-opioid receptor agonists is dependent on PKC, whereas tolerance induced by the high-efficacy agonist DAMGO is dependent on GRK.},

	abstract = {Ligand-directed signaling has been suggested as a basis for the differences in responses evoked by otherwise receptor-selective agonists. The underlying mechanisms are not understood, yet clearer definition of this concept may be helpful in the development of novel, pathway-selective therapeutic agents. We previously showed that κ-opioid receptor activation of JNK by one class of ligand, but not another, caused persistent receptor inactivation. In the current study, we found that the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) could be similarly inactivated by a specific ligand class including the prototypical opioid, morphine. Acute analgesic tolerance to morphine and related opioids (morphine-6-glucuronide and buprenorphine) was blocked by JNK inhibition, but not by G protein receptor kinase 3 knockout. In contrast, a second class of μ-opioids including fentanyl, methadone, and oxycodone produced acute analgesic tolerance that was blocked by G protein receptor kinase 3 knockout, but not by JNK inhibition. Acute MOR desensitization, demonstrated by reduced D-Ala2-Met5-Glyol-enkephalin–stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to spinal cord membranes from morphine-pretreated mice, was also blocked by JNK inhibition; however, desensitization of D-Ala2-Met5-Glyol-enkephalin–stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding following fentanyl pretreatment was not blocked by JNK inhibition. JNK-mediated receptor inactivation of the κ-opioid receptor was evident in both agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding and opioid analgesic assays; however, gene knockout of JNK 1 selectively blocked κ-receptor inactivation, whereas deletion of JNK 2 selectively blocked MOR inactivation. These findings suggest that ligand-directed activation of JNK kinases may generally provides an alternate mode of G protein–coupled receptor regulation.},

Biotechnological applications toward Cannabis research and product development are still in their early stages. An important feature of biotechnology is the collection of gene transfer technologies that are used to introduce genetic material into host organisms. Agrobacterium tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes represent the most common vectors to transfer genetic material into plant cells. Stable and transient gene expression can be achieved using A. tumefaciens while A. rhizogenes generates stable transformed hairy roots. Cannabis is amenable to genetic transformation using both Agrobacterium vectors, however the plant is recalcitrant to regeneration, impeding the recovery of transgenic Cannabis plants. Despite this shortcoming, the cannabinoid pathway is currently attracting considerable attention from the biotechnology community. Gene transfer technologies have assisted with the characterization of the cannabinoid pathway leading to the synthesis of THCA, the psychoactive compound that is highly valued as a therapeutic. Elucidation of the cannabinoid pathway has led to its metabolic engineering in heterologous hosts. The yeast Pichia pastoris has proven to be a particularly suitable host for the production of cannabinoids. Recently, biotechnology companies have emerged that anticipate commercializing cannabinoid-based drugs in yeast and tobacco and to produce hemp cultivars with the cannabinoid pathway down-regulated or completely knocked out.},

At 6 months of age, animals were transferred to the laboratory animal facility, where they remained until 18 months of age. Animals of the CRI and CRII groups were submitted to CR for 6 months. In the ultrastructural analysis, a disorganization of the periganglionar matrix with the aging was observed, and this characteristic was not observed in the animals that received hypocaloric diet. It was observed that the restriction of 12.5\% and 31\% of calories in the diet minimized the increase in density and cell profile of the reactive NADPH neurons, increased with age. This type of diet may be adapted against gastrointestinal disturbances that commonly affect aging individuals.},

	abstract = {BackgroundOlder patients can be especially susceptible to antipsychotic-induced side effects, and the pharmacodynamic mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. We hypothesized that age-related epigenetic alterations lead to decreased expression and functionality of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), contributing to this susceptibility.MethodsIn this study, we treated young (2–3 months old) and aged (22–24 months old) C57BL/6 mice with the D2R antagonist haloperidol (HAL) once a day for 14 days to evaluate HAL-induced motor side effects. In addition, we pretreated separate groups of young and aged mice with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors valproic acid (VPA) or entinostat (MS-275) and then administered HAL.ResultsOur results show that the motor side effects of HAL are exaggerated in aged mice as compared to young mice and that HDAC inhibitors are able to reverse the severity of these deficits. HAL-induced motor deficits in aged mice are associated with an age- and drug-dependent decrease in striatal D2R protein levels and functionality. Further, histone acetylation was reduced while histone tri-methylation was increased at specific lysine residues of H3 and H4 within the Drd2 promoter in the striatum of aged mice. HDAC inhibitors, particularly VPA, restored striatal D2R protein levels and functionality and reversed age- and drug-related histone modifications at the Drd2 promoter.ConclusionsThese results suggest that epigenetic changes at the striatal Drd2 promoter drive age-related increases in antipsychotic side effect susceptibility, and HDAC inhibitors may be an effective adjunct treatment strategy to reduce side effects in aged populations.},

The functional data of 10 participants were analysed through a pattern classification approach.ResultsIn bilateral LOC clusters, the classifier was able to discriminate between patterns of activity elicited by visually similar smoking-related (cigarettes) and neutral objects (pencils) above empirically estimated chance levels only during deprivation (mean = 61.0\%, chance (permutations) = 50.0\%, p = .01) but not during satiation (mean = 53.5\%, chance (permutations) = 49.9\%, ns.). For all other stimulus contrasts, there was no difference in discriminability between the deprived and satiated conditions.ConclusionThe discriminability between smoking and non-smoking visual objects was elevated in object-selective brain region LOC after a period of nicotine abstinence. This indicates that attention bias likely affects basic visual object processing.},

	abstract = {RationaleKappa-opioid receptor (KOPr) agonists have pre-clinical anti-cocaine and analgesic effects. However, side effects including sedation, dysphoria, aversion, anxiety and depression limit their therapeutic development. The unique structure of salvinorin A has been used to develop longer acting KOPr agonists.ObjectivesWe evaluate two novel C-2 analogues of salvinorin A, ethoxymethyl ether Sal B (EOM Sal B) and β-tetrahydropyran Sal B (β-THP Sal B) alongside U50,488 for their ability to modulate cocaine-induced behaviours and side effects, pre-clinically.MethodsAnti-cocaine properties of EOM Sal B were evaluated using the reinstatement model of drug seeking in self-administering rats. EOM Sal B and β-THP Sal B were evaluated for effects on cocaine-induced hyperactivity, spontaneous locomotor activity and sucrose self-administration. EOM Sal B and β-THP Sal B were evaluated for aversive, anxiogenic and depressive-like effects using conditioned place aversion (CPA), elevated plus maze (EPM) and forced swim tests (FSTs), respectively.ResultsEOM Sal B (0.1, 0.3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) dose dependently attenuated drug seeking, and EOM Sal B (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) and β-THP Sal B (1 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated cocaine-induced hyperactivity. No effects on locomotor activity, open arm times (EPM) or swimming behaviours (FST) were seen with EOM (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) or β-THP Sal B (1 or 2 mg/kg, i.p.). However, β-THP Sal B decreased time spent in the drug-paired chamber.ConclusionEOM Sal B is more potent than Sal A and β-THP Sal B in reducing drug-seeking behaviour with fewer side effects. EOM Sal B showed no effects on sucrose self-administration (0.1 mg/kg), locomotor, depressive-like, aversive-like or anxiolytic effects.},

	abstract = {Repeated binge-like exposure to alcohol during adolescence has been reported to perturb prefrontal cortical development, yet the mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. Here we report that adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure induces cellular and dopaminergic abnormalities in the adult prelimbic cortex (PrL-C). Exposing rats to alcohol during early-mid adolescence (PD28â€“42) increased the density of long/thin dendritic spines of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the adult PrL-C. Interestingly, although AIE exposure did not alter the expression of glutamatergic proteins in the adult PrL-C, there was a pronounced reduction in dopamine (DA) D1 receptor modulation of both intrinsic firing and evoked NMDA currents in pyramidal cells, whereas D2 receptor function was unaltered. Recordings from fast-spiking interneurons also revealed that AIE reduced intrinsic excitability, glutamatergic signaling, and D1 receptor modulation of these cells. Analysis of PrL-C tissue of AIE-exposed rats further revealed persistent changes in the expression of DA-related proteins, including reductions in the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). AIE exposure was associated with hypermethylation of the COMT promoter at a conserved CpG site in exon II. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that AIE exposure disrupts DA and GABAergic transmission in the adult medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). As DA and GABA work in concert to shape and synchronize neuronal ensembles in the PFC, these alterations could contribute to deficits in behavioral control and decision-making in adults who abused alcohol during adolescence.},

One such proposed biomarker is the calcium binding protein S100β, which, depending on its local concentration, is known to exhibit both neurotrophic and neuroinflammatory properties in the central nervous system. At present, relatively little is known regarding the effect of chronic S100β disruption in AD. Dietary intake has been identified as a modifiable risk factor for AD. Preliminary in vitro and animal studies have demonstrated an association between S100β expression and dietary intake which links to AD pathophysiology. This review describes the association of S100β to fatty acids, ketone bodies, insulin, and botanicals as well as the potential impact of physical activity as a lifestyle factor. We also discuss the prospective implications of these findings, including support of the use of a Mediterranean dietary pattern and/or the ketogenic diet as an approach to modify AD risk.},

	abstract = {Discontinuing unhealthy behaviors, such as overeating or drug use, depends upon an individual’s ability to overcome the influence of environmental reward cues. The strength of that influence, however, varies greatly depending upon the internal state of the body. Characterizing the relationship between interoceptive signaling and shifting drug cue valuation provides an opportunity for understanding the neural bases of how changing internal states alter reward processing more generally. A total of 17 cigarette smokers rated the pleasantness of cigarette pictures when they were nicotine sated or nicotine abstinent. On both occasions, smokers also underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning while performing a visceral interoceptive attention task and a resting-state functional connectivity scan. Hemodynamic, physiological, and behavioral parameters were compared between sated and abstinent scans. The relationships between changes in these parameters across scan sessions were also examined. Smokers rated cigarette pictures as significantly more pleasant while nicotine abstinent than while nicotine sated. Comparing abstinent with sated scans, smokers also exhibited significantly decreased mid-insula, amygdala, and orbitofrontal activity while attending to interoceptive signals from the body. Change in interoceptive activity within the left mid-insula predicted the increase in smoker’s pleasantness ratings of cigarette cues. This increase in pleasantness ratings was also correlated with an increase in resting-state functional connectivity between the mid-insula and the ventral striatum and ventral pallidum. These findings support a model wherein interoceptive processing in the mid-insula of withdrawal signals from the body potentiates the motivational salience of reward cues through the recruitment of hedonic ‘hot spots’ within the brain’s reward circuitry.},

	abstract = {It is becoming increasingly accepted that creative performance, especially divergent thinking, may depend on reduced activity within the default mode network (DMN), related to mind-wandering and autobiographic self-referential processing. However, the relationship between trait (resting-state) DMN activity and divergent thinking is controversial. Here, we test the relationship between resting-state DMN activity and divergent thinking in a group of mindfulness meditation practitioners. We build on our two previous reports, which have shown DMN activity to be related to resting-state log gamma (25–45 Hz) power and inter-hemispheric functional connectivity. Using the same cohort of participants (three mindfulness groups with increasing expertise, and controls, n = 12 each), we tested (1) divergent thinking scores (Flexibility and Fluency) using the Alternative Uses task and (2) correlation between Alternative Uses scores and DMN activity as measured by resting-state gamma power and inter-hemispheric functional connectivity. We found that both Fluency and Flexibility (1) were higher in the two long-term mindfulness groups ({\textgreater}1000 h) compared to short-term mindfulness practitioners and control participants and (2) negatively correlated with gamma inter-hemispheric functional connectivity (frontal-midline and posterior-midline connections). In addition, (3) Fluency was significantly correlated with mindfulness expertise. Together, these results show that long-term mindfulness meditators exhibit higher divergent thinking scores in correlation with their expertise and demonstrate a negative divergent thinking—resting-state DMN activity relationship, thus largely support a negative DMN-creativity connection.},

	abstract = {The fact that tobacco ingestion can affect how people feel and think has been known for millennia, placing the plant among those used spiritually, honori?cally, and habitually (Corti 1931; Wilbert 1987). However, the conclusion that nicotine - counted for many of these psychopharmacological effects did not emerge until the nineteenth century (Langley 1905). This was elegantly described by Lewin in 1931 as follows: “The decisive factor in the effects of tobacco, desired or undesired, is nicotine. . . ”(Lewin 1998). The use of nicotine as a pharmacological probe to und- stand physiological functioning at the dawn of the twentieth century was a landmark in the birth of modern neuropharmacology (Limbird 2004; Halliwell 2007), and led the pioneering researcher John Langley to conclude that there must exist some “- ceptive substance” to explain the diverse actions of various substances, including nicotine, when applied to muscle tissue (Langley 1905). Research on tobacco and nicotine progressed throughout the twentieth century, but much of this was from a general pharmacological and toxicological rather than a psychopharmacological perspective (Larson et al. 1961). There was some attention to the effects related to addiction, such as euphoria (Johnston 1941), tolerance (Lewin 1931), and withdrawal (Finnegan et al. 1945), but outside of research supported by the tobacco industry, addiction and psychopharmacology were not major foci for research (Slade et al. 1995; Hurt and Robertson 1998; Henning?eld et al. 2006; Henning?eld and Hartel 1999; Larson et al. 1961).},

The current study sought to explore the anti-inflammatory effects of naringin on chronic pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation in cigarette smoke (CS)-induced rats. Seventy Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into seven groups to study the effects of CS with or without various concentrations of naringin or saline for 8 weeks. The results revealed that naringin supplementation at 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg significantly increased body weight of CS-induced rats as compared to that in the CS group. Moreover, naringin of 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg prevented CS-induced infiltration of neutrophils and activation of myeloperoxidase and matrix metalloproteinase-9, in parallel with suppression of the release of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was significantly suppressed after CS exposure, but dose dependently elevated by naringin. The results from hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that naringin dose dependently reduced CS-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells, thickening of the bronchial wall, and expansion of average alveolar airspace. In conclusion, our data suggest that naringin is an effective anti-inflammatory compound for attenuating chronic pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation in CS-induced rats.},

Control enzyme activity was reduced by more than 70\% by grapefruit juice. Freshly-squeezed sour (Seville) orange juice containing 20\% as much naringin was comparable to grapefruit juice in its ability to inhibit microsomal activity. An aqueous solution of naringin at the same concentration as in grapefruit juice produced only a small decrease in 6 beta-hydroxytestosterone formation. Dilution of grapefruit juice with a naringin solution reduced the inhibitory activity of the juice even though naringin concentration did not change. Naringenin did not form under the incubation conditions used indicating that it did not contribute to the inhibition produced by grapefruit juice. Finally, organic extracts of grapefruit juice possessed considerable inhibitory activity even though naringin was not extractable. These data suggest that grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A activity in vitro and that neither naringin nor naringenin are primarily responsible for this effect.

	abstract = {Neurodegeneration is induced by tryptamine, a human diet constituent, which easily crosses the blood/brain barrier. Tryptamine neurotoxicity, caused by tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) inhibition and downregulation leads to tryptophanyl-tRNA deficiency and synthesis of aberrant proteins. We identified axonal defects in hippocampus of tryptamine- treated mice similar to those observed in human brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy using anti-TrpRS site-directed antibodies. The axonal defects are characterized by swellings that accumulate abnormal amounts of helical filaments and amyloid. Tryptamine produced a decreased density of somatic mitochondria concomitant with neuronal loss in mouse hippocampus. In addition, tryptamine evoked accumulation and clustering of small mitochondria in mouse hippocampus causing axonal swellings. Similarly, mitochondrial fission, fusion and clustering were revealed in human neuronal cells after tryptamine administration. Moreover the tryptamine-induced mitochondrial neuropathology includes electron-dense deposits comprising helical fibrils, cristae disruption, cristolysis, mitochondrial swelling and mitochondria-derived vesicles. TrpRS+ helical filamentous tangles formed in both neuronal and kidney cells following tryptamine treatment suggest a tryptamine broad cytotoxic repertoire in damaging vital organs. Tryptamine elicited vesicularization of inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, axonal and cell membranes. Ultrastructurally, fragmentation of swollen degenerated mitochondria, small mitochondria clustering and neurofibrillary tangles are associated with axonal membrane protrusions attributed as neuritic swellings at a lower magnification. TrpRS+ axonal swellings associated with neuropathology of patients and tryptamine-treated human cells suggest that under toxic concentrations, tryptamine is implicated as a causative agent in neurodegeneration resembling that defining a number of human diseases.},

	abstract = {Cannabis sativa is the source of a unique set of compounds known collectively as plant cannabinoids or phytocannabinoids. This review focuses on the manner with which three of these compounds, (−)-trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), (−)-cannabidiol (CBD) and (−)-trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (Δ9-THCV), interact with cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. Δ9-THC, the main psychotropic constituent of cannabis, is a CB1 and CB2 receptor partial agonist and in line with classical pharmacology, the responses it elicits appear to be strongly influenced both by the expression level and signalling efficiency of cannabinoid receptors and by ongoing endogenous cannabinoid release. CBD displays unexpectedly high potency as an antagonist of CB1/CB2 receptor agonists in CB1- and CB2-expressing cells or tissues, the manner with which it interacts with CB2 receptors providing a possible explanation for its ability to inhibit evoked immune cell migration. Δ9-THCV behaves as a potent CB2 receptor partial agonist in vitro. In contrast, it antagonizes cannabinoid receptor agonists in CB1-expressing tissues. This it does with relatively high potency and in a manner that is both tissue and ligand dependent. Δ9-THCV also interacts with CB1 receptors when administered in vivo, behaving either as a CB1 antagonist or, at higher doses, as a CB1 receptor agonist. Brief mention is also made in this review, first of the production by Δ9-THC of pharmacodynamic tolerance, second of current knowledge about the extent to which Δ9-THC, CBD and Δ9-THCV interact with pharmacological targets other than CB1 or CB2 receptors, and third of actual and potential therapeutic applications for each of these cannabinoids.},

	abstract = {A large number of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) show varying degrees of basal or constitutive activity. This constitutive activity is usually minimal in natural receptors but is markedly observed in wild type and mutated (naturally or induced) receptors. According to conventional two-state drug receptor interaction model, binding of a ligand may initiate activity (agonist with varying degrees of positive intrinsic activity) or prevent the effect of an agonist (antagonist with zero intrinsic activity). Inverse agonists bind with the constitutively active receptors, stabilize them, and thus reduce the activity (negative intrinsic activity). Receptors of many classes (α-and β-adrenergic, histaminergic, GABAergic, serotoninergic, opiate, and angiotensin receptors) have shown basal activity in suitable in vitro models. Several drugs that have been conventionally classified as antagonists (β-blockers, antihistaminics) have shown inverse agonist effects on corresponding constitutively active receptors. Nearly all H1 and H2 antihistaminics (antagonists) have been shown to be inverse agonists. Among the β-blockers, carvedilol and bucindolol demonstrate low level of inverse agonism as compared to propranolol and nadolol. Several antipsychotic drugs (D2 receptors antagonist), antihypertensive (AT1 receptor antagonists), antiserotoninergic drugs and opioid antagonists have significant inverse agonistic activity that contributes partly or wholly to their therapeutic value. Inverse agonism may also help explain the underlying mechanism of beneficial effects of carvedilol in congestive failure, naloxone-induced withdrawal syndrome in opioid dependence, clozapine in psychosis, and candesartan in cardiac hypertrophy. Understanding inverse agonisms has paved a way for newer drug development. It is now possible to develop agents, which have only desired therapeutic value and are devoid of unwanted adverse effect. Pimavanserin (ACP-103), a highly selective 5-HT2A inverse agonist, attenuates psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease with psychosis and is devoid of extrapyramidal side effects. This dissociation is also evident from the development of anxioselective benzodiazepines devoid of habit-forming potential. Hemopressin is a peptide ligand that acts as an antagonist as well as inverse agonist. This agent acts as an antinociceptive agent in different in vivo models of pain. Treatment of obesity by drugs having inverse agonist activity at CB1/2 receptors is also underway. An exciting development is evaluation of β-blockers in chronic bronchial asthma—a condition akin to congestive heart failure where β-blockade has become the standard mode of therapy. Synthesis and evaluation of selective agents is underway. Therefore, inverse agonism is an important aspect of drug–receptor interaction and has immense untapped therapeutic potential.},

	abstract = {The molecular basis for the decline in experience-dependent neural plasticity over age remains poorly understood. In visual cortex, the robust plasticity induced in juvenile mice by brief monocular deprivation (MD) during the critical period is abrogated by genetic deletion of Arc, an activity-dependent regulator of excitatory synaptic modification. Here we report that augmenting Arc expression in adult mice prolongs juvenile-like plasticity in visual cortex, as assessed by recordings of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in vivo. A distinguishing characteristic of juvenile OD plasticity is the weakening of deprived-eye responses, believed to be accounted for by the mechanisms of homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD). Accordingly, we also found increased LTD in visual cortex of adult mice with augmented Arc expression, and impaired LTD in visual cortex of juvenile mice that lack Arc or have been treated in vivo with a protein synthesis inhibitor. Further, we found that although activity-dependent expression of Arc mRNA does not change with age, expression of Arc protein is maximal during the critical period and declines in adulthood. Finally, we show that acute augmentation of Arc expression in wild type adult mouse visual cortex is sufficient to restore juvenile-like plasticity. Together, our findings suggest a unifying molecular explanation for the age- and activity-dependent modulation of synaptic sensitivity to deprivation.},

	abstract = {Given that cannabis use is increasing in the United States, pharmacological treatment options to treat cannabis use disorder are needed. Opioid antagonists modulate cannabinoid effects and may offer a potential approach to reducing cannabis use. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled human laboratory study, we assessed the effects of naltrexone maintenance on the reinforcing, subjective, psychomotor, and cardiovascular effects of active and inactive cannabis. Nontreatment-seeking, daily cannabis smokers were randomized to receive naltrexone (50 mg: n=18 M and 5 F) or placebo (0 mg; n=26 M and 2 F) capsules for 16 days. Before, during, and after medication maintenance, participants completed 10 laboratory sessions over 4-6 weeks, assessing cannabis' behavioral and cardiovascular effects. Medication compliance was verified by observed capsule administration, plasma naltrexone, and urinary riboflavin. Relative to placebo, maintenance on naltrexone significantly reduced both active cannabis self-administration and its positive subjective effects ('good effect'). Participants in the placebo group had 7.6 times (95\% CI: 1.1-51.8) the odds of self-administering active cannabis compared with the naltrexone group. This attenuation of reinforcing and positive subjective effects also influenced cannabis use in the natural ecology. Naltrexone had intrinsic effects: decreasing ratings of friendliness, food intake, and systolic blood pressure, and increasing spontaneous reports of stomach upset and headache, yet dropout rates were comparable between groups. In summary, we show for the first time that maintenance on naltrexone decreased cannabis self-administration and ratings of 'good effect' in nontreatment-seeking daily cannabis smokers. Clinical studies in patients motivated to reduce their cannabis use are warranted to evaluate naltrexone's efficacy as a treatment for cannabis use disorder.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Laboratory animal and human models of drug self-administration are used to evaluate potential pharmacotherapies for drug abuse, yet the utility of these models in predicting clinically useful medications is variable.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to track how antagonist, agonist, and partial agonist medication approaches influence heroin and cocaine self-administration by rodents, non-human primates, and humans and to compare these results to clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: Across species, heroin self-administration was decreased by all three medication approaches, paralleling their demonstrated clinical utility. The heroin data emphasize the importance of assessing a medication's abuse liability preclinically to predict medication abuse and compliance and of considering subject characteristics (e.g., opioid dependence) when interpreting medication effects. For cocaine, the effects of ecopipam, modafinil, and aripiprazole were consistent in the laboratory and clinic, provided that the medications were administered repeatedly before self-administration sessions. Modafinil attenuated cocaine's reinforcing effects in the human laboratory and improved treatment outcome, while ecopipam and aripiprazole increased the reinforcing effects of cocaine and do not appear promising in the clinic.
CONCLUSIONS: The self-administration model has reliably identified medications to treat opioid dependence, and the recent data with modafinil suggest that the human laboratory model also identifies medications to treat cocaine dependence. There have been numerous false positives when subjective effects are the primary outcome measure, but not when self-administration is the outcome. Factors relevant to the predictive validity of self-administration procedures include medication maintenance and the concurrent assessment of a range of behaviors to determine abuse liability and the specificity of effect.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Studies in non-human animals suggest that opioid antagonists block the reinforcing effects of cannabinoids.
OBJECTIVE: The present studies in humans investigated how naltrexone modulates (1) the subjective and physiological effects of oral THC in comparison to methadone, (2) the reinforcing effects of oral THC, and (3) plasma levels of oral THC.
METHODS: In study 1, marijuana smokers (n=9) received naltrexone (0, 50 mg) followed 30 min later by THC (0, 15, 30 mg) or methadone (5, 10 mg). Subjective effects, task performance, pupillary diameter, and cardiovascular parameters were measured repeatedly. In study 2a, marijuana smokers (n=23) were randomly assigned to one THC dose condition (0, 15 or 30 mg). One set of color-coded capsules containing THC and active naltrexone (50 mg) was given in one session, while another set of color-coded capsules containing THC and placebo naltrexone was given in another session. In the final three sessions, participants chose which color capsules they would receive. In study 2b, a subset of participants from study 2a (n=7) received naltrexone (0, 50 mg) 30 min prior to oral THC (30 mg) administration, and blood was drawn repeatedly.
RESULTS: Pretreatment with naltrexone significantly increased many of the "positive" subjective effects of oral THC (30 mg) e.g. ratings of Good Drug Effect and Capsule Liking. Naltrexone tended to increase the reinforcing effects of oral THC (30 mg), as indicated by performance in a drug choice test. Naltrexone did not alter plasma THC levels.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that naltrexone increases the subjective effects of oral THC. Thus, oral THC's effects are enhanced rather than antagonized by opioid receptor blockade in heavy marijuana smokers.},

The objective of this study was to test a lower, more opioid-selective dose of naltrexone (12 mg) in combination with THC. The influence of marijuana-use history and sex was also investigated. Naltrexone (0, 12 mg) was administered 30 min before oral THC (0-40 mg) or methadone (0-10 mg) capsules, and subjective effects, task performance, pupillary diameter, and cardiovascular parameters were assessed in marijuana smoking (Study 1; n=22) and in nonmarijuana smoking (Study 2; n=21) men and women. The results show that in marijuana smokers, low-dose naltrexone blunted the intoxicating effects of a low THC dose (20 mg), while increasing ratings of anxiety at a higher THC dose (40 mg). In nonmarijuana smokers, low-dose naltrexone shifted THC's effects in the opposite direction, enhancing the intoxicating effects of a low THC dose (2.5 mg) and decreasing anxiety ratings following a high dose of THC (10 mg). There were no sex differences in these interactions, although among nonmarijuana smokers, men were more sensitive to the effects of THC alone than women. To conclude, a low, opioid-selective dose of naltrexone blunted THC intoxication in marijuana smokers, while in nonmarijuana smokers, naltrexone enhanced THC intoxication. These data demonstrate that the interaction between opioid antagonists and cannabinoid agonists varies as a function of marijuana use history.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: Studies in laboratory animals strongly suggest reciprocal modulation of the opioidergic and endocannabinoid systems, a relationship that has not been demonstrated in humans. This study sought to clarify this interaction by assessing how a range of naltrexone doses altered the subjective, cognitive, and cardiovascular effects of marijuana.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Daily marijuana smokers (n = 29) participated in this within-subject, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Naltrexone (0, 12, 25, 50, or 100 mg) was administered before active or inactive marijuana (3.27 or 0\% THC) was smoked.
RESULTS: Active marijuana increased subjective ratings of marijuana 'Strength,' 'High,' and positive subjective ratings of marijuana quality and drug effect including 'Liking,' 'Good,' and 'Take Again' compared to inactive marijuana. Naltrexone alone decreased ratings of 'Liking,' 'Take Again,' and 'Stimulated' compared with placebo, but increased ratings of drug 'Strength,' 'High,' 'Good,' 'Liking,' 'Stimulated,' and 'Take Again' when administered under active marijuana conditions. Active marijuana did not affect performance on cognitive tasks relative to inactive marijuana, whereas naltrexone decreased performance when administered alone or in combination with active marijuana. Active marijuana increased heart rate compared to inactive marijuana under placebo naltrexone conditions. Although naltrexone alone decreased heart rate, it further increased marijuana's cardiovascular effect.
CONCLUSIONS: In heavy marijuana smokers opioid-receptor blockade enhanced the subjective and cardiovascular effects of marijuana, suggesting that endogenous opioids dampen cannabinoid effects in this population. These findings demonstrate that a broad range of clinically used doses of naltrexone potentially increases the abuse liability and cardiovascular risks of cannabinoids.},

These effects may be unique to low dosages of naltrexone and appear to be entirely independent from naltrexone’s better-known activity on opioid receptors. As a daily oral therapy, LDN is inexpensive and well-tolerated. Despite initial promise of efficacy, the use of LDN for chronic disorders is still highly experimental. Published trials have low sample sizes, and few replications have been performed. We cover the typical usage of LDN in clinical trials, caveats to using the medication, and recommendations for future research and clinical work.

Preliminary studies in animals and humans suggest that ayahuasca, psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may have antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive properties. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of clinical trials published from 1990 until 2015, assessing these therapeutic properties. Electronic searches were performed using the PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO databases. Only clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals were included. Of these, 151 studies were identified, of which six met the established criteria. Reviewed studies suggest beneficial effects for treatment-resistant depression, anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening diseases, and tobacco and alcohol dependence. All drugs were well tolerated. In conclusion, ayahuasca, psilocybin and LSD may be useful pharmacological tools for the treatment of drug dependence, and anxiety and mood disorders, especially in treatment-resistant patients. These drugs may also be useful pharmacological tools to understand psychiatric disorders and to develop new therapeutic agents. However, all studies reviewed had small sample sizes, and half of them were open-label, proof-of-concept studies.

	abstract = {Objectives To investigate the association between antidepressant treatment and risk of several potential adverse outcomes in older people with depression and to examine risks by class of antidepressant, duration of use, and dose.
Design Cohort study of people aged 65 and over diagnosed as having depression.
Setting 570 general practices in the United Kingdom supplying data to the QResearch primary care database.
Participants 60 746 patients diagnosed as having a new episode of depression between the ages of 65 and 100 years from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2007 and followed up until 31 December 2008.
Main outcome measures Hazard ratios associated with antidepressant use for all cause mortality, attempted suicide/self harm, myocardial infarction, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, falls, fractures, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, epilepsy/seizures, road traffic accidents, adverse drug reactions, and hyponatraemia, adjusted for a range of potential confounding variables. Hazard ratios were calculated for antidepressant class (tricyclic and related antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, other antidepressants), dose, and duration of use and for commonly prescribed individual drugs.
Results 54 038 (89.0\%) patients received at least one prescription for an antidepressant during follow-up. A total of 1 398 359 antidepressant prescriptions were issued: 764 659 (54.7\%) for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 442 192 (31.6\%) for tricyclic antidepressants, 2203 (0.2\%) for monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and 189 305 (13.5\%) for the group of other antidepressants. The associations with the adverse outcomes differed significantly between the antidepressant classes for seven outcomes. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were associated with the highest adjusted hazard ratios for falls (1.66, 95\% confidence interval 1.58 to 1.73) and hyponatraemia (1.52, 1.33 to 1.75) compared with when antidepressants were not being used. The group of other antidepressants was associated with the highest adjusted hazard ratios for all cause mortality (1.66, 1.56 to 1.77), attempted suicide/self harm (5.16, 3.90 to 6.83), stroke/transient ischaemic attack (1.37, 1.22 to 1.55), fracture (1.64, 1.46 to 1.84), and epilepsy/seizures (2.24, 1.60 to 3.15), compared with when antidepressants were not being used. Tricyclic antidepressants did not have the highest hazard ratio for any of the outcomes. Significantly different associations also existed between the individual drugs for the same seven outcomes; trazodone (tricyclic antidepressant), mirtazapine, and venlafaxine (both in the group of other antidepressants) were associated with the highest rates for some of these outcomes. Absolute risks over 1 year for all cause mortality were 7.04\% for patients while not taking antidepressants, 8.12\% for those taking tricyclic antidepressants, 10.61\% for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and 11.43\% for other antidepressants.
Conclusions Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and drugs in the group of other antidepressants were associated with an increased risk of several adverse outcomes compared with tricyclic antidepressants. Among individual drugs, trazodone, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine were associated with the highest risks for some outcomes. As this is an observational study, it is susceptible to confounding by indication, channelling bias, and residual confounding, so differences in characteristics between patients prescribed different antidepressant drugs that could account for some of the associations between the drugs and the adverse outcomes may remain. Further research is needed to confirm these findings, but the risks and benefits of different antidepressants should be carefully evaluated when these drugs are prescribed to older people.},

	abstract = {Objectives
We analyzed the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS) database to determine whether suicidal events (attempts and ideation) occurred early in treatment, could be predicted by severity of depression or other clinical characteristics, and were preceded by clinical deterioration or symptoms of increased irritability, akathisia, sleep disruption, or mania.

Methods
TADS was a 36-week randomized controlled clinical trial of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments involving 439 youths with major depressive disorder. Suicidal events were defined according to the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicidal Assessment.

Results
Forty-four patients (10.0\%) had at least one suicidal event (no suicide occurred). Events occurred 0.4–31.1 weeks (mean 11.9 ± 8.2) after starting TADS treatment, with no difference in event timing for patients receiving medication versus those not on medication. Severity of self-rated pre-treatment suicidal ideation (Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire for Adolescents score ≥ 31) and depressive symptoms (Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale score ≥91), predicted occurrence of suicidal events during treatment (p{\textless}0.05). Patients with suicidal event were on average still moderately ill prior to the event (Clinical Global Impression- severity score 4.0 ± 1.3), and only minimally improved (Clinical Global Impression- improvement score 3.2 ± 1.1). Events were not preceded by increased irritability, akathisia, sleep disturbance, or manic signs. Specific inter-personal stressors were identified in 73\% of cases. Of the events, 55\% resulted in overnight hospitalization.

Conclusions
Most suicidal events occurred in the context of persistent depression and insufficient improvement, without evidence of medication-induced behavioral activation as a precursor. Severity of self-rated suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms predicted emergence of suicidality during treatment. Risk for suicidal events did not decrease after the first month of treatment, suggesting the need for careful clinical monitoring for several months after starting treatment.},

It has been suggested that psychedelics expand the breadth of cognition via actions on the central nervous system. Previous work has shown changes in semantic processing under psilocybin (a related psychedelic to LSD) that are consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation. The present study investigates this further using a picture-naming task and the psychedelic, LSD. Ten participants completed the task under placebo and LSD. Results revealed significant effects of LSD on accuracy and error correction that were consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation under LSD. These results are consistent with a generalised “entropic” effect on the mind. We suggest incorporating direct neuroimaging measures in future studies, and to employ more naturalistic measures of semantic processing that may enhance ecological validity.},

	abstract = {The combined infusion of Banisteriopsis caapis stem and Psychotria viridis leaves, known as ayahuasca, has been used for centuries by indigenous tribes. The infusion is rich in N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), with properties similar to those of serotonin. Despite substantial progress in the development of new drugs to treat anxiety and depression, current treatments have several limitations. Alternative drugs, such as ayahuasca, may shed light on these disorders. Here, we present time-course behavioral changes induced by ayahuasca in zebrafish, as first step toward establishing an ideal concentration for pre-clinical evaluations. We exposed adult zebrafish to 5 concentrations of the ayahuasca infusion: 0ml/L (control), 0.1ml/L, 0.5ml/L, 1ml/L and 3ml/L (n=14 each group), and behavior was recorded for 60 min. We evaluated swimming speed, distance traveled, freezing and bottom dwelling every min for 60 min. Swimming speed and distance traveled decreased with an increase in ayahuasca concentration while freezing increased with 1 and 3ml/L. Bottom dwelling increased with 1 and 3 ml/L, but declined with 0.1ml/L. Our data suggest that small amounts of ayahuasca do not affect locomotion and reduce anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish, while increased doses of the drug lead to crescent anxiogenic effects. We conclude that the temporal analysis of zebrafish behavior is a sensitive method for the study of ayahuasca-induced functional changes in the vertebrate brain.},

	abstract = {As long ago as the sixteenth century, Paracelsus recognized that ‘the dose makes the poison’. Indeed, environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals excreted by humans are limited, most importantly because a defined dose is given to just a fraction of the population. By contrast, recent studies have identified direct emission from drug manufacturing as a source of much higher environmental discharges that, in some cases, greatly exceed toxic threshold concentrations. Because production is concentrated in specific locations, the risks are not linked to usage patterns. Furthermore, as the drugs are not consumed, metabolism in the human body does not reduce concentrations. The environmental risks associated with manufacturing therefore comprise a different, wider set of pharmaceuticals compared with those associated with risks from excretion. Although pollution from manufacturing is less widespread, discharges that promote the development of drug-resistant microorganisms can still have global consequences. Risk management also differs between production and excretion in terms of accountability, incentive creation, legal opportunities, substitution possibilities and costs. Herein, I review studies about industrial emissions of pharmaceuticals and the effects associated with exposure to such effluents. I contrast environmental pollution due to manufacturing with that due to excretion in terms of their risks and management and highlight some recent initiatives.},

As the endocannabinoid (eCB) system has a pivotal role in emotional memory processing and related synaptic plasticity, here we seek to review and discuss accumulating evidence on how and where in the brain interventions targeting the eCB system would attenuate outcomes associated with traumatic events and/or drug addiction through memory extinction facilitation or reconsolidation disruption. Currently available data from mouse, rat, monkey and healthy human studies investigating the effects of cannabinoid drugs on extinction and reconsolidation of aversive memories are more consistent than those related to rewarding drug-associated memories. Interventions able to attenuate aversive memories by extinction facilitation or reconsolidation disruption have boosted the anandamide-induced activation of cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptors. A still limited number of studies report that CB1 receptor activation could also be effective in facilitating the extinction or disrupting the reconsolidation of rewarding drug-associated memories. The reinstatement of extinguished drug memories (relapse) is reduced by CB1 receptor antagonism. The cannabidiol has shown to be effective in any of the aforementioned cases, albeit its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Brain areas in which cannabinoid drugs induce these effects include the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and/or nucleus accumbens. The potential role of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and cannabinoid type-2 (CB2) receptors in emotional memory extinction and reconsolidation is currently under investigation. Overall, preclinical data support a closer look into certain cannabinoid drugs owing to their safety and potential therapeutic value against stress-related and drug use disorders.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the anxiolytic effect of cannabidiol (CBD) in humans follows the same pattern of an inverted U-shaped dose-effect curve observed in many animal studies. Sixty healthy subjects of both sexes aged between 18 and 35 years were randomly assigned to five groups that received placebo, clonazepam (1mg), and CBD (100, 300, and 900mg). The subjects underwent a test of public speaking in a real situation (TPSRS) where each subject had to speak in front of a group formed by the remaining participants. Each subject completed the anxiety and sedation factors of the Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS) and had their blood pressure and heart rate recorded. These measures were obtained in five experimental sessions with 12 volunteers each. Each session had four steps at the following times (minutes) after administration of the drug/placebo, as time 0: -5 (baseline), 80 (pre-test), 153 (speech), and 216 (post-speech). Repeated-measures analyses of variance showed that the TPSRS increased the subjective measures of anxiety, heart rate, and blood pressure. Student-Newman-Keuls test comparisons among the groups in each phase showed significant attenuation in anxiety scores relative to the placebo group in the group treated with clonazepam during the speech phase, and in the clonazepam and CBD 300 mg groups in the post-speech phase. Clonazepam was more sedative than CBD 300 and 900 mg and induced a smaller increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than CBD 300 mg. The results confirmed that the acute administration of CBD induced anxiolytic effects with a dose-dependent inverted U-shaped curve in healthy subjects, since the subjective anxiety measures were reduced with CBD 300mg, but not with CBD 100 and 900 mg, in the post-speech phase.},

We found that AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in pyramidal neurons of prefrontal cortex (PFC) was diminished in SHR, which was correlated with the decreased surface expression of AMPAR subunits. Administration of methylphenidate (a psychostimulant drug used to treat ADHD), which blocks dopamine transporters and norepinephrine transporters, ameliorated the behavioral deficits of adolescent SHR and restored AMPAR-mediated synaptic function. Activation of PFC pyramidal neurons with a CaMKII-driven Gq-coupled designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug also led to the elevation of AMPAR function and the normalization of ADHD-like behaviors in SHR. These results suggest that the disrupted function of AMPARs in PFC may underlie the behavioral deficits in adolescent SHR and enhancing PFC activity could be a treatment strategy for ADHD.},

The aim of this review is to provide all the available information on these two fentanyl analogues.MethodsAll reviewed information was gathered through a detailed search of PubMed and the World Wide Web using relevant keywords.ResultsLike most of the members of the family of fentanyls, they are either sold as heroin to unsuspecting users or used extensively to lace heroin street samples. Despite the fact that ocfentanil was studied clinically in the early 1990s, it did not manage to find its place in clinical practice. On the other hand, carfentanil is mainly used today as an anesthetic agent in large animals. Ocfentanil and carfentanil are used and abused extensively, mainly in Europe and in the United States. As a result, they are the cause of some verified intoxication cases and deaths worldwide. This review provides information concerning chemistry, synthesis, prevalence, pharmacology, and toxicology, as well as the current legal status of these two fentanyl analogues. Analytical methods developed for the determination of ocfentanil and carfentanil in biological specimens and seized materials, as well as related intoxication and lethal cases are also presented.ConclusionsOcfentanil and carfentanil are undeniably very dangerous opioid drugs and a very serious matter of concern for public safety.

They then performed a computerised test battery assessing cognitive function. Measures of pulse rate, arterial oxygen saturation and mean arterial pressure were also taken. Finally, participants completed visual analogue scales assessing their subjective mood state.Results The majority of cognitive tasks showed dose-dependent declines in performance. Mean arterial pressure was significantly reduced, as was pulse rate. Subjective alertness showed a similar decline.Conclusions Flumazenil has been clinically described as an agent with few intrinsic properties, whose primary effect lies in its ability to reverse benzodiazepine-induced states. This study has shown that flumazenil does possess intrinsic activity which have a significant effect on cognition, cardiovascular physiology and mood. Clinicians need to be aware of these effects.},

This study examined whether low doses of flumazenil would improve event-related brain potential (ERP) indicators of selective attention and induce feelings of activation and anxiety in healthy men. Data from 11 men (24-30 years) who received intravenous flumazenil (0.2 mg, plus 0.3 mg 30 minutes later) and placebo were analyzed according to a double-blind crossover design. ERPs were recorded while subjects performed an auditory selective attention task. Mismatch negativity (MMN), processing negativity (PN), and the P3 component were extracted from the ERP as markers of preattentive mismatch processing, selective attention, and stimulus processing within working memory, respectively. Counting accuracy and performance on a letter cancellation test were used as behavioral indicators of attention. Mood was assessed by an adjective checklist and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Flumazenil significantly increased PN over frontocortical areas, indicating improved selective attention (p {\textless} 0.05). Increases in the P3 amplitude and MMN after drug treatment remained nonsignificant. Subjects felt more activated and extraverted after flumazenil treatment than after placebo (p {\textless} 0.05). Anxiety was not increased. The findings of this study confirm the concept that flumazenil administered at a low dose in humans exerts effects opposite to those of benzodiazepines.

The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), could enhance learning and memory. Pretraining injection of flumazenil (2.5 to 40.0 mg/kg) was found to enhance both learning and memory in a test requiring young mice to discriminate the correct arm of a T-maze to escape mild electric shock. In a second test, which required mice to passively avoid a dark chamber after shock, flumazenil pretreatment prevented the occurrence of amnesia induced by the cholinergic receptor antagonist scopolamine. It is hypothesized that flumazenil may facilitate learning or memory processes by reversing a negative modulatory influence of endogenous diazepam-like ligands for benzodiazepine receptors.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives:
Patients with central disorders of hypersomnolence sometimes do not achieve satisfactory symptom control with currently available wake-promoting medications. Based on the finding that the cerebrospinal fluid from some patients with hypersomnolence demonstrates potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptors in excess of that of controls, a finding that reverses with flumazenil, we initiated prescribing compounded flumazenil to carefully selected, treatment-refractory hypersomnolent patients.

Methods:
This retrospective chart review evaluated the first 153 consecutive patients treated with transdermal and/or sublingual flumazenil by physicians at our center from 2013 through January 2015.

Results:
Patients were 35.5 y old (± 14.4) and 92 (60.1\%) were women. Mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores prior to flumazenil were 15.1 (± 4.5) despite prior or current treatment with traditional wake-promoting therapies. Symptomatic benefit was noted by 96 patients (62.8\%), with a mean reduction in Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 4.7 points (± 4.7) among responders. Of these, 59 remained on flumazenil chronically, for a mean of 7.8 mo (± 6.9 mo). Female sex and presence of reported sleep inertia differentiated flumazenil responders from nonresponders. Adverse events were common, but often did not result in treatment discontinuation. Serious adverse events included a transient ischemic attack and a lupus vasculopathy, although whether these events occurred because of flumazenil administration is unknown.

Conclusions:
This chart review demonstrates that sublingual and transdermal flumazenil provided sustained clinical benefit to 39\% of patients with treatment-refractory hypersomnolence. Prospective, controlled studies of this GABA-A receptor antagonist for the treatment of hypersomnolence are needed.

On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.

He said, "Son, I've made my life out of readin' people's faces,
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
so if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
Know when to walk away and know when to run.
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.

Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and ev'ry hand's a loser,
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep."

When he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
Know when to walk away and know when to run.
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.

	abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the relationship between the use of zolpidem and subsequent cancer risk in Taiwanese patients.

Methods
We used data from the National Health Insurance system of Taiwan to investigate whether use of zolpidem was related to cancer risk. For the study cohort, we identified 14,950 patients who had received a first prescription for zolpidem from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2000. For each zolpidem user, we selected randomly 4 comparison patients without a history of using zolpidem who were frequency-matched by sex, age, and year of the index date. Incidence rates of all cancers and selected site-specific cancers were measured by the end of 2009, and related hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of the cancer were measured as well.

Results
The risk of developing any cancer was greater in patients using zolpidem than in nonusers (HR, 1.68; 95\% CI, 1.55-1.82). The stratified analysis showed that the overall HR for high-dosage zolpidem (â‰¥300 mg/y) was 2.38. The site-specific cancer risk was the highest for oral cancer (HR, 2.36; 95\% CI, 1.57-3.56), followed by kidney cancer, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, and bladder cancer (HR, 1.60; 95\% CI, 1.06-2.41). Men were at higher risk than women.

Conclusion
This population-based study revealed some unexpected findings, suggesting that the use of zolpidem may be associated with an increased risk of subsequent cancer. Further large-scale and in-depth investigations in this area are warranted.},

The short-term use of one-two prescriptions is associated with greater risk per dose than long-term use. Hypnotics are usually prescribed without approved indication, most often with specific contraindications, but even when indicated, there is little or no benefit. The recommended doses objectively increase sleep little if at all, daytime performance is often made worse, not better, and the lack of general health benefits is commonly misrepresented in advertising. Treatments such as the cognitive behavioral treatment of insomnia and bright light treatment of circadian rhythm disorders might offer safer and more effective alternative approaches to insomnia.},

	abstract = {Anesthetics and sedatives contribute to postoperative immunosuppression.Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemotactic and activating factor that mediates neutrophil adhesion and margination and is essential for host defense. We investigated the effect of anesthetics on isolated human polymorphonuclear leukocyte production of IL-8. Healthy human polymorphonuclear leukocytes were isolated using a single-step density gradient and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide in the presence of varying concentrations of propofol or midazolam for up to 20 h. IL-8 was measured in both culture supernatants and cell lysates using enzyme immunoassay, and IL-8 mRNA in cells was measured using Northern blotting and phosphorimaging. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance or the Mann-Whitney U-test as appropriate. Lipopolysaccharide increased extracellular accumulation of interleukin-8, which was suppressed by both propofol (P = 0.025) and midazolam (P = 0.028). However, intracellular IL-8 increased with exposure to lipopolysaccharide (P = 0.028) and remained increased with both anesthetics. Northern blot analysis also revealed increased IL-8 mRNA levels in the presence of both midazolam and propofol, which was confirmed by molecular imaging. These data strongly suggest that the anesthetics modulate transport or secretion of IL-8 protein from the cell. Suppression of IL-8 by anesthetics and sedatives may predispose postoperative and intensive care patients to infection. Implications: Anesthesia causes immune suppression and alters neutrophil function. We investigated the effect of propofol and midazolam on interleukin-8, a neutrophil chemotactic agent in human neutrophils. Both anesthetics decreased extracellular interleukin-8 accumulation, but intracellular levels and mRNA remained high. This suggests that propofol and midazolam alter interleukin-8 secretion from cells.

	abstract = {The treatment of neuropathic pain is a major unresolved medical challenge. Present pharmacotherapies only have modest efficacy and numerous side effects. The use of opioid analgesics is additionally coupled with dependence and withdrawal syndromes. Ibudilast (AV-411) is a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor that is also known to suppress glial cell activation. It has been used clinically for other indications with a good safety profile. As glial cell activation is considered to crucially contribute to neuropathic pain as well as opioid dependence and withdrawal, the authors conceived that ibudilast may be useful for treating these conditions. Preclinical data indicate that ibudilast crosses the blood-brain barrier, is well tolerated, is active on oral administration, reduces glial activation and attenuates pain symptoms in diverse rat models of neuropathic pain. In addition, it enhances acute morphine analgesia and attenuates morphine tolerance and withdrawal. Thus ibudilast may improve opioid efficacy and is a promising therapeutic candidate for neuropathic pain, with a novel mechanism of action.},

The role of dietary modification on gut bacterial populations and the possibility of such microbial population shifts related to learning and behavior is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to examine whether shifts in bacterial diversity due to dietary manipulation could be correlated with changes in memory and learning. Five week old male CF1 mice were randomly assigned to receive standard rodent chow (PP diet) or chow containing 50\% lean ground beef (BD diet) for 3 months. As a measure of memory and learning, both groups were trained and tested on a hole-board open field apparatus. Following behavioral testing, all mice were sacrificed and colonic stool samples collected and analyzed by automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) and bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) approach for microbial diversity. Results demonstrated significantly higher bacterial diversity in the beef supplemented diet group according to ARISA and bTEFAP. Compared to the PP diet, the BD diet fed mice displayed improved working (P=0.0008) and reference memory (P{\textless}0.0001). The BD diet fed animals also displayed slower speed (P{\textless}0.0001) in seeking food as well as reduced anxiety level in the first day of testing (P=0.0004). In conclusion, we observed a correlation between dietary induced shifts in bacteria diversity and animal behavior that may indicate a role for gut bacterial diversity in memory and learning.},

	abstract = {The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the authority to regulate cigarette smoke constituents, and a reduction in nicotine content might benefit public health by reducing the prevalence of smoking. Research suggests that cigarette smoke constituents that inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) may increase the reinforcing value of low doses of nicotine. The aim of the present experiments was to further characterize the impact of MAO inhibition on the primary reinforcing and reinforcement enhancing effects of nicotine in rats. In a series of experiments, rats responded for intravenous nicotine infusions or a moderately-reinforcing visual stimulus in daily 1-h sessions. Rats received pre-session injections of known MAO inhibitors. The results show that (1) tranylcypromine (TCP), a known MAO inhibitor, increases sensitivity to the primary reinforcing effects of nicotine, shifting the dose-response curve for nicotine to the left, (2) inhibition of MAO-A, but not MAO-B, increases low-dose nicotine self-administration, (3) partial MAO-A inhibition, to the degree observed in chronic cigarette smokers, also increases low-dose nicotine self-administration, and (4) TCP decreases the threshold nicotine dose required for reinforcement enhancement. The results of the present experiments suggest cigarette smoke constituents that inhibit MAO-A, in the range seen in chronic smokers, are likely to increase the primary reinforcing and reinforcement enhancing effects of low doses of nicotine. If the FDA reduces the nicotine content of cigarettes, then variability in constituents that inhibit MAO-A could impact smoking.},

	abstract = {Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is a mitochondrial outer-membrane flavoenzyme involved in brain and peripheral oxidative catabolism of neurotransmitters and xenobiotic amines, including neurotoxic amines, and a well-known target for antidepressant and neuroprotective drugs. Recently, positron emission tomography imaging has shown that smokers have a much lower activity of peripheral and brain MAO-A (30\%) and -B (40\%) isozymes compared to non-smokers. This MAO inhibition results from a pharmacological effect of smoke, but little is known about its mechanism. Working with mainstream smoke collected from commercial cigarettes we confirmed that cigarette smoke is a potent inhibitor of human MAO-A and -B isozymes. MAO inhibition was partly reversible, competitive for MAO-A, and a mixed-type inhibition for MAO-B. Two beta-carboline alkaloids, norharman (beta-carboline) and harman (1-methyl-beta-carboline), were identified by GC-MS, quantified, and isolated from the mainstream smoke by solid phase extraction and HPLC. Kinetics analysis revealed that beta-carbolines from cigarette smoke were competitive, reversible, and potent inhibitors of MAO enzymes. Norharman was an inhibitor of MAO-A (K(i)=1.2+/-0.18 microM) and MAO-B (K(i)=1.12+/-0.19 microM), and harman of MAO-A (K(i)=55.54+/-5.3nM). Beta-carboline alkaloids are psychopharmacologically active compounds that may occur endogenously in human tissues, including the brain. These results suggest that beta-carboline alkaloids from cigarette smoke acting as potent reversible inhibitors of MAO enzymes may contribute to the MAO-reduced activity produced by tobacco smoke in smokers. The presence of MAO inhibitors in smoke like beta-carbolines and others may help us to understand some of the purported neuropharmacological effects associated with smoking.},

It has been shown that these compounds are normal body constituents formed endogenously but external sources have been identified. Here, we summarise literature data on levels of norharman and harman in fried meat and fish, meat extracts, alcoholic drinks, and coffee brews. Other sources include edible and medicinal plants but tobacco smoke has been identified as a major source. Exposure levels from these different dietary sources are estimated to a maximum of 4 microg norharman per kg body weight (bw) per day and 1 microg harman per kg bw per day. Exposure via tobacco smoke depends on smoking habits and type of cigarettes but can be estimated to 1.1 microg/kg bw for norharman and 0.6 microg/kg bw for harman per package of cigarettes smoked. Studies on toxicokinetics indicate that inhalative exposure leads to a rapid increase in plasma levels and high bioavailability of norharman and harman. Oral bioavailability is lower but there are indications that sublingual absorption may increase dietary uptake of beta-carbolines. Endogenous formation can be estimated to be 50-100 ng/kg bw per day for norharman and about 20 ng/kg bw per day for harman but these rates may increase with high intake of precursors. Biomarker studies on plasma levels of beta-carbolines reported on elevated levels of norharman, harman or both in diseased patients, alcoholics and following tobacco smoking or consumption of beta-carboline-containing food. Cigarette smoking has been identified as major influence but dietary exposure may contribute to exposure.},

Dopamine is a substrate for both forms. 2-Naphthylamine is a carcinogen found in high concentrations in cigarette smoke. The results of this study show that 2-naphthylamine has the ability to inhibit mouse brain MAO A and B in vitro by mixed type inhibition (competitive and non-competitive). The Ki for MAO A was determined to be 52.0 microM and for MAO B 40.2 microM. The inhibitory effect of 2-naphthylamine on both MAO A and B catalytic activity, supports the hypothesis that smoking decreases MAO activity in vivo, instead that smokers with lower MAO activity are more prone to become a smoker.},

In this paper, we report the results of efforts to identify compounds present in flue-cured tobacco leaves that inhibit MAO. The isolation procedure was guided by estimating the inhibitory properties of tobacco leaf extracts on the liver mitochondrial MAO-B-catalyzed oxidation of 1-methyl-4-(1-methylpyrrol-2-yl)-1,2,3, 6-tetrahydropyridine to the corresponding dihydropyridinium metabolite. Fractionation of extracts from flue-cured tobacco leaves led to the isolation of a competitive inhibitor of human MAO-A (K(i) = 3 microM) and MAO-B (K(i) = 6 microM), the structure of which could be assigned by classical spectroscopic analysis and confirmed by synthesis.

Our aim was to test the contribution of the harman and norharman in tobacco smoke to MAO-A inhibition from tobacco smoke preparations, as part of a re-examination of harman and norharman as the cause of the inhibition of MAO-A inhibition in the brain. Tobacco smoke particulate matter and cigarette smoke particulate matter were prepared and the amounts of harman and norharman measured. The results were compared with the total monoamine oxidase-A inhibitory activity. At a nicotine concentration of 0.6Î¼M (a "physiological" concentration in blood) the total monoamine oxidase-A inhibitory activity measured in these samples was sufficient to inhibit the enzyme by approximately 10\%. Of this inhibitory activity, only a small proportion of the total was found to be due to harman and norharman. These results show that harman and norharman provide only a moderate contribution to the total monoamine oxidase-A inhibitory activity of tobacco smoke, perhaps under 10\%. This suggests that other inhibitors (either known or unknown) may be more significant contributors to total inhibitory activity than has yet been established, and deserve closer examination.},

We found that repeated METH administration impaired long term (24h) memory retention without affecting short term (5min) memory retention. Co-administration of MEM with METH before training session significantly improved METH-induced cognitive function. METH significantly decreased expression level of Bcl-2 and increased expression level of cleaved caspase-3 in the PFC. The changes can be prevented by MEM pretreatment. Thus, these results demonstrated that MEM pretreatment reversed METH-induced changes of protein levels of apoptotic-related gene, and produced protective effects against METH-induced cognitive deficits, suggesting the effectiveness of MEM may be due to its anti-apoptotic activity.},

A higher dose of ascorbate (500 mg/kg) did not influence the CPP induced by either dose of amphetamine. In vitro release assays revealed that, whereas ascorbate alone (0.01-1.0 mM) did not influence striatal dopamine levels, this vitamin potentiated amphetamine-induced dopamine release in both the nucleus accumbens and neostriatum.

	abstract = {Among the various neurotransmitter systems implicated in the mechanism of action of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), the relationship between the dopaminergic system and ascorbic acid is not particularly clear. Ascorbic acid is speculated to have an antagonistic effect on dopaminergic modulation. With this background in mind, in the present study we have seen the effect of ascorbic acid per se and in combination with typical and atypical antipsychotic agents against apomorphine-induced stereotypic behavior in mice. Male Laka mice weighing 20-25 g were used in the present study. Apomorphine-induced stereotypic behavior was used as an animal model. Various dopaminergic modulators were used. Ascorbic acid dose-dependently inhibited stereotypic behavior produced by apomorphine in mice. It potentiated the antipsychotic activity of haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg i.p.), a typical antipsychotic agent. When administered along with atypical antipsychotics, clozapine (1-2 mg/kg i.p.), sulpiride (10-20 mg/kg i.p.) and risperidone (0.0025 mg/kg i.p.), ascorbic acid also potentiated their activity. Also when given along with SCH-23390, a selective D(1) antagonist, an additive effect was observed. Ascorbic acid also inhibited the supersensitization response of apomorphine on reserpinization (2 mg/kg i.p.). Interestingly, at a lower dose (100 mg/kg i.p.), ascorbic acid potentiated the dopaminergic activity of apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg) and BHT-920 (0.25 mg/kg i.p.). However, when given concomitantly with SKF-38393, it failed to alter the response of SKF-38393. The data substantiate the hypothesis that ascorbic acid potentiated the activity of typical as well as atypical antipsychotics and that the effect of ascorbic acid on the dopaminergic system is markedly dose dependent; a low dose (100 mg/kg i.p.) potentiated the dopaminergic action while higher doses (400-1,600 mg/kg i.p.) blocked it.},

	abstract = {The repeated intermittent administration of relatively low doses of amphetamine (AMPH) produces an enduring hypersensitivity to the motor stimulant effects of AMPH (behavioral sensitization), and this is accompanied by enhanced mesotelencephalic dopamine (DA) utilization/release. In contrast, chronic treatment with very high doses of AMPH does not produce sensitization, but is neurotoxic, resulting in the depletion of brain DA (and often other monoamines). However, gradually escalating doses of AMPH provide protection against the neurotoxic effects of higher doses given later. Therefore, the purpose of the present experiment was to determine if a regimen of gradually escalating doses of AMPH, culminating in much higher doses than usually used to study sensitization, would produce neural and behavioral changes associated with AMPH neurotoxicity (DA depletion) or behavioral sensitization (increased DA utilization). Female rats were given 60 injections (2/day) of increasing (1 to 10 mg/kg) doses of d-AMPH, culminating in rats receiving 20 mg/kg/day for four consecutive days. This treatment did not deplete brain DA or serotonin, but did produce a long-lasting enhancement (at least 12 days) in striatal and nucleus accumbens DOPAC concentrations, and DOPAC/DA ratios. These neurochemical changes were accompanied by an enduring hypersensitivity to the stereotypy-producing effects of a subsequent AMPH 'challenge.' In contrast to this enhanced response to a challenge, AMPH-pretreated rats showed a marked reduction in spontaneous nocturnal motor activity. It is concluded that rats can be given escalating doses of AMPH, which mimic to some extent the AMPH 'runs' common in addicts and that this produces neural and behavioral changes consistent with the development of sensitization; not neurotoxicity.},

The neural mechanisms underlying this switch between activation and deactivation of large-scale brain networks remain completely unknown. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the mechanisms underlying switching of brain networks in three different experiments. We first examined this switching process in an auditory event segmentation task. We observed significant activation of the CEN and deactivation of the DMN, along with activation of a third network comprising the right fronto-insular cortex (rFIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), when participants perceived salient auditory event boundaries. Using chronometric techniques and Granger causality analysis, we show that the rFIC-ACC network, and the rFIC, in particular, plays a critical and causal role in switching between the CEN and the DMN. We replicated this causal connectivity pattern in two additional experiments: (i) a visual attention “oddball” task and (ii) a task-free resting state. These results indicate that the rFIC is likely to play a major role in switching between distinct brain networks across task paradigms and stimulus modalities. Our findings have important implications for a unified view of network mechanisms underlying both exogenous and endogenous cognitive control.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by altered intrinsic functional connectivity within (intra-iFC) intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), such as the Default Mode- (DMN), Salience- (SN) and Central Executive Network (CEN). It has been proposed that aberrant switching between DMN-mediated self-referential and CEN-mediated goal-directed cognitive processes might contribute to MDD, possibly explaining patients’ difficulties to disengage the processing of self-focused, often negatively biased thoughts. Recently, it has been shown that the right anterior insula (rAI) within the SN is modulating DMN/CEN interactions. Since structural and functional alterations within the AI have been frequently reported in MDD, we hypothesized that aberrant intra-iFC in the SN´s rAI is associated with both aberrant iFC between DMN and CEN (inter-iFC) and severity of symptoms in MDD. Twenty-five patients with MDD and 25 healthy controls were assessed using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and psychometric examination. High-model-order independent component analysis (ICA) of rs-fMRI data was performed to identify ICNs including DMN, SN, and CEN. Intra-iFC within and inter-iFC between distinct subsystems of the DMN, SN and CEN were calculated, compared between groups and correlated with the severity of symptoms. Patients with MDD showed (1) decreased intra-iFC within the SN´s rAI, (2) decreased inter-iFC between the DMN and CEN and (3) increased inter-iFC between the SN and DMN. Moreover, decreased intra-iFC in the SN´s rAI was associated with severity of symptoms and aberrant DMN/CEN interactions, with the latter losing significance after correction for multiple comparisons. Our results provide evidence for a relationship between aberrant intra-iFC in the salience network’s rAI, aberrant DMN/CEN interactions and severity of symptoms, suggesting a link between aberrant salience mapping, abnormal coordination of DMN/CEN based cognitive processes and psychopathology in MDD.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging research has demonstrated that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) encodes value signals that can be modulated by top-down cognitive input such as semantic knowledge, price incentives, and monetary favors suggesting that such biases may have an identified biological basis. It has been hypothesized that mindfulness training (MT) provides one path for gaining control over such top-down influences; yet, there have been no direct tests of this hypothesis. Here, we probe the behavioral and neural effects of MT on value signals in vmPFC in a randomized longitudinal design of 8 weeks of MT on an initially naÃ¯ve subject cohort. The impact of this within-subject training was assessed using two paradigms: one that employed primary rewards (fruit juice) in a simple conditioning task and another that used a well-validated art-viewing paradigm to test bias of monetary favors on preference. We show that MT behaviorally censors the top-down bias of monetary favors through a measurable influence on value signals in vmPFC. MT also modulates value signals in vmPFC to primary reward delivery. Using a separate cohort of subjects we show that 8 weeks of active control training (ACT) generates the same behavioral impact also through an effect on signals in the vmPFC. Importantly, functional connectivity analyses show that value signals in vmPFC are coupled with bilateral posterior insula in the MT groups in both paradigms, but not in the ACT groups. These results suggest that MT integrates interoceptive input from insular cortex in the context of value computations of both primary and secondary rewards.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Sleep quality may be directly related with vitamin D serum level. Some studies found that people with lower vitamin D serum level experienced a lower sleep quality. Consequently, this study aimed at determining the effect of vitamin D supplements on sleep score and quality in 20-50 year-old people with sleep disorders.
METHODS: This double blind, clinical trial was performed in November 2015-February 2016 on 89 people with sleep disorders based on Petersburg's Sleep Index. Patient samples were divided randomly into two groups: intervention and placebo. At the end of the study, the data on 89 subjects (44 in intervention group and 45 people in placebo group) were examined. Intervention group received a 50 000-unit vitamin D supplement, one in a fortnight for 8 weeks. Meanwhile, placebo group received placebo. Before and after intervention, Petersburg's Sleep Quality Questionnaire, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, general information questionnaire, sun exposure, vitamin D serum level and 3-day food record questionnaire were assessed and recorded for all participants. To analyze data, t-test, chi square, ANCOVA, U-Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon statistical tests were used.
FINDINGS: Based on the results of the present study, at the end of the study sleep score (PSQI) reduced significantly in vitamin recipients as compared with placebo recipients (P {\textless} 0.05). This difference was significant even after modifying confounding variables (P {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study shows that the use of vitamin D supplement improves sleep quality, reduces sleep latency, raises sleep duration and improves subjective sleep quality in people of 20-50 year-old with sleep disorder.},

We demonstrate here that carbon monoxide, a by-product of heme catabolism by heme oxygenase, mediates potent anti-inflammatory effects. Both in vivo and in vitro, carbon monoxide at low concentrations differentially and selectively inhibited the expression of lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta and increased the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10. Carbon monoxide mediated these anti-inflammatory effects not through a guanylyl cyclase-cGMP or nitric oxide pathway, but instead through a pathway involving the mitogen-activated protein kinases. These data indicate the possibility that carbon monoxide may have an important protective function in inflammatory disease states and thus has potential therapeutic uses.},

	volume = {14},
	issn = {1742-2094},
	doi = {10.1186/s12974-017-0905-7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The endogenously produced gaseous molecule carbon monoxide is able to promote organ protection after ischemia-reperfusion injuries (IRI). The impact of carbon monoxide releasing molecules (CORM) regarding inflammation in neuronal tissues has not been studied in detail. In this investigation, we aimed to analyze the effects of the CORM ALF-186 on neuro-inflammation and hypothesized that the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is playing a decisive role.
METHODS: Retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury was performed for 60 min in Sprague-Dawley rats. Thereafter, the CORM ALF-186 (10 mg/kg) in the presence or absence of the sGC inhibitor ODQ was injected via a tail vein. Retinal tissue was harvested 24 h later to analyze mRNA or protein expression of sGC-β1 subunit, transcription factors NF-κB and CREB, the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, as well as the heat shock proteins (HSP) HSP-70 and HSP-90. Immunohistochemistry was performed on frozen sections of the retina. The overall neuroprotective effect of ALF-186 was assessed by counting fluorogold-pre-labeled retinal ganglion cells (RGC) 7 days after IRI.
RESULTS: Ischemia-reperfusion mediated loss of vital RGC was attenuated by the administration of ALF-186 after injury. ALF-186 treatment after IRI induced sGC-ß1 leading to a decreased NF-κB and CREB phosphorylation. Consecutively, ALF-186 mitigated IRI induced TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the retina and in the rats' serum. Moreover, ALF-186 attenuated heat shock protein 70 (Hsp-70) while increasing Hsp-90. The sGC-inhibitor ODQ attenuated the anti-inflammatory effects of ALF-186 and increased retinal loss of ganglion cells. These results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry.
CONCLUSION: The CORM ALF-186 protected RGC from IRI induced loss. Furthermore, ALF-186 reduced IRI mediated neuroinflammation in the retina and in the serum by activating sGC. Inhibition of sGC stopped the beneficial and protective effects of ALF-186. ALF-186 may present a promising therapeutic alternative in treating inflammation after neuronal IRI.},

Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a prototypic subclass of MAPKs and is densely expressed in postmitotic neurons of adult mammalian brains. Active ERK translocates into the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Additionally, ERK is visualized in neuronal peripheries, such as distal synaptic structures. While nuclear ERK is a known sensitive target of psychostimulants, little is known about the responsiveness of synaptic ERK to stimulants. In this study, we focused on ERK at synaptic versus extrasynaptic sites and investigated its responses to the psychostimulant amphetamine in the adult rat striatum and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in vivo. We used a pre-validated biochemical fractionation procedure to isolate synapse- and extrasynapse-enriched membranes. We found that two common ERK isoforms (ERK1 and ERK2) were concentrated more in extrasynaptic fractions than in synaptic fractions in striatal and cortical neurons under normal conditions. At synaptic sites, ERK2 was noticeably more abundant than ERK1. Acute injection of amphetamine induced an increase in ERK2 phosphorylation in the synaptic fraction of striatal neurons, while the drug did not alter extrasynaptic ERK2 phosphorylation. Similar results were observed in the mPFC. In both synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments, total ERK1/2 proteins remained stable in response to amphetamine. Our data establish the subsynaptic distribution pattern of MAPK/ERK in striatal and cortical neurons. Moreover, the synaptic pool of ERK2 in these neurons can be selectively activated by amphetamine.},

NO has significant physiological functions and an increasing body of evidence suggests that NO pathways are implicated in a number of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative dementias. NO is continuously released by endothelial cells in the vascular system, whereas advanced age in the presence of vascular risk factor causes a decrease in cerebral blood flow, involving microvasculopathy with impaired NO release, which in turn results in regional metabolic dysfunction. This finding suggests that vascular pathology plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of so-called neurodegenerative dementias. Inflammatory responses are commonly found in the brain under a variety of neurodegenerative dementias, including AD and dementia with Lewy bodies, in which up-regulation of NOS expression, suggesting overproduction of NO, is found in neurons and glia. NO is thought to be involved in such neuroinflammation due to its free radical properties, which compromise cellular integrity and viability via mitochondrial damage. Further studies to elucidate NO pathways in neurodegenerative dementias could lead to a better understanding of their pathogenesis and improved therapeutic strategies, and therefore are certainly warranted.},

Fifteen healthy men with minimal earlier exposure to cannabis were scanned while performing a verbal memory task, a response inhibition task, a sensory processing task, and when viewing fearful faces. Subjects were scanned on three occasions, each preceded by oral administration of Δ-9-THC, CBD, or placebo. BOLD responses were measured using fMRI. In a second experiment, six healthy volunteers were administered Δ-9-THC intravenously on two occasions, after placebo or CBD pretreatment to examine whether CBD could block the psychotic symptoms induced by Δ-9-THC. Δ-9-THC and CBD had opposite effects on activation relative to placebo in the striatum during verbal recall, in the hippocampus during the response inhibition task, in the amygdala when subjects viewed fearful faces, in the superior temporal cortex when subjects listened to speech, and in the occipital cortex during visual processing. In the second experiment, pretreatment with CBD prevented the acute induction of psychotic symptoms by Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.

	abstract = {The inability to learn an adaptive coping strategy in a novel stressful condition leads to dysfunctional stress coping, a marker of mental disturbances. This study tested the involvement of dorsal striatal dopamine receptors in the dysfunctional coping with the Forced Swim test fostered by a previous experience of reduced food availability. Adult male mice were submitted to a temporary (12 days) reduction of food availability (food-restricted: FR) or continuously free-fed (FF). Different groups of FF and FR mice were used to evaluate: 1) dorsal striatal mRNA levels of the two isoforms of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2S, D2L). 2) Forced Swim-induced c-fos expression in the dorsal striatum; 3) acquisition and 24h retention of passive coping with Forced Swim. Additional groups of FF mice were tested for 24h retention of passive coping acquired during a first experience with Forced Swim immediately followed by intra-striatal infusion of vehicle or two doses of the dopamine D2/D3 receptors antagonist sulpiride or the D1/D5 receptors antagonist SCH23390. Previous restricted feeding selectively reduced mRNA levels of both D2 isoforms and abolished Forced Swim-induced c-fos expression in the left Dorsolateral Striatum and selectively prevented 24h retention of the coping strategy acquired in a first experience of Forced Swim. Finally, temporary blockade of left Dorsolateral Striatum D2/D3 receptors immediately following the first Forced Swim experience selectively reproduced the behavioral effect of restricted feeding in FF mice. In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that mice previously exposed to a temporary reduction of food availability show low striatal D2 receptors, a known marker of addiction-associated aberrant neuroplasticity, as well as liability to relapse into maladaptive stress coping strategies. Moreover, they offer strong support to a causal relationship between reduction of D2 receptors in the left Dorsolateral Striatum and impaired consolidation of newly acquired adaptive coping.},

	abstract = {Rationale Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of D-amphetamine used for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Lisdexamfetamine is thought to have a prolonged pharmacokinetic profile compared with oral D-amphetamine, possibly associated with lower drug liking and a lower risk of oral misuse. However, differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lisdexamfetamine and D-amphetamine have not been directly compared. Methods Equimolar doses of D-amphetamine (40mg) and lisdexamfetamine (100mg), and placebo were administered in 24 healthy subjects in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Plasma concentrations of amphetamine, subjective effects, and vital signs were repeatedly assessed. The pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modeling. Results The increase in plasma concentrations of amphetamine had a 0.6±0.6 h (mean±SD) longer lag time and reached peak levels 1.1±1.5 h later after lisdexamfetamine administration compared with D-amphetamine administration, but no differences in maximal concentrations or total exposure (AUC) were found between the two treatments. Consistent with the pharmacokinetics, the subjective and cardiovascular stimulant effects of lisdexamfetamine also occurred later compared with D-amphetamine. However, no differences in peak ratings of potentially abuse-related subjective drug effects (e.g., drug liking, drug high, stimulation, happy, well-being, and self-confidence) were observed after lisdexamfetamine administration compared with D-amphetamine administration. Lisdexamfetamine and D-amphetamine also produced similar peak increases in mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, pupil size, and adverse effects. Conclusions The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lisdexamfetamine are similar to D-amphetamine administered 1h later. Lisdexamfetamine is likely associated with a similar risk of oral abuse as D-amphetamine.},

	abstract = {Menopause is associated with increased risk to develop obesity but the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. We have shown that Ginkgo biloba (GbE) improved diet-induced obesity. Since GbE might be effective in the treatment of obesity related to menopause, avoiding the side effects of hormone replacement therapy, we investigated the effect of GbE on hypothalamic systems controlling energy homeostasis. Wistar rats were either ovariectomized (OVX) or sham-operated. After 2 months, either 500mg.kg-1 of GbE or vehicle were administered daily by gavage for 14 days. A subset of animals received an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of serotonin (300µg) or vehicle and food intake was measured after 12 and 24 hours. Another subset was submitted to in vivo microdialysis and 5-HT levels of the medial hypothalamus were measured by HPLC, before and up to 2 hours after the administration of 500mg.kg-1 of GbE. Additional animals were used for quantification of 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2C, 5-HTT and POMC hypothalamic protein levels by Western blotting. OVX increased food intake and body weight and adiposity while GbE attenuated these alterations. I.c.v. serotonin significantly reduced food intake in Sham, Sham+GbE and OVX+GbE groups while it failed to do so in the OVX group. In the ovariectomized rats, GbE stimulated 5-HT microdialysate levels while it reduced hypothalamic 5-HTT protein levels. The results indicate that GbE improved the ovariectomy-induced resistance to serotonin hypophagia, at least in part through stimulation of the hypothalamic serotonergic activity. Since body weight gain is one of the most important consequences of menopause, the stimulation of the serotonergic transmission by GbE may represent a potential alternative therapy for menopause-related obesity.},

Conversely, field dependence individuals tend to focus their attention on single environmental features analysing them individually. This cognitive style affects several visuo-spatial abilities including spatial memory. This study assesses both the effect of field independence and field dependence on performance displayed on virtual environments of different complexity. Forty young healthy individuals took part in this study. Participants performed the Embedded Figures Test for field independence or dependence assessment and a new spatial memory recognition test. The spatial memory recognition test demanded to memorize a green box location in a virtual room picture. Thereafter, during ten trials participants had to decide if a green box was located in the same position as in the sample picture. Five of the pictures were correct. The information available in the virtual room was manipulated. Hence, two different experimental conditions were tested: a virtual room containing all landmarks and a virtual room with only two cues. Accuracy and reaction time were registered. Analyses demonstrated that higher field independent individuals were related to better spatial memory performance in two landmarks condition and were faster in all landmark condition. In addition, men and women did not differ in their performance. These results suggested that cognitive style affects spatial memory performance and this phenomenon is modulated by environment complexity. This does not affect accuracy but time spent. Moreover, field dependent individuals are unable to organize the navigational field by relying on internal reference frames when few landmarks are available, and this causes them to commit more errors.},

Seminal psilocybin positron emission tomography (PET) research suggested regional increases in glucose metabolism in frontal cortex (hyperfrontality). However, a recent arterial spin labeling (ASL) study suggests psilocybin may lead to hypo-perfusion in various brain regions. In this placebo-controlled, double-blind study we used pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) to measure perfusion changes, with and without adjustment for global brain perfusion, after two doses of oral psilocybin (low dose: 0.160 mg/kg; high dose: 0.215 mg/kg) in two groups of healthy controls (n = 29 in both groups, total N = 58) during rest. We controlled for sex and age and used family-wise error corrected p values in all neuroimaging analyses. Both dose groups reported profound subjective drug effects as measured by the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D-ASC) with the high dose inducing significantly larger effects in four out of the 11 scales. After adjusting for global brain perfusion, psilocybin increased relative perfusion in distinct right hemispheric frontal and temporal regions and bilaterally in the anterior insula and decreased perfusion in left hemispheric parietal and temporal cortices and left subcortical regions. Whereas, psilocybin significantly reduced absolute perfusion in frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, and bilateral amygdalae, anterior cingulate, insula, striatal regions, and hippocampi. Our analyses demonstrate consistency with both the hyperfrontal hypothesis of psilocybin and the more recent study demonstrating decreased perfusion, depending on analysis method. Importantly, our data illustrate that relative changes in perfusion should be understood and interpreted in relation to absolute signal variations.},

Here we used psilocybin, a classic psychedelic found in magic mushrooms, and a task-free functional MRI (fMRI) protocol designed to capture the transition from normal waking consciousness to the psychedelic state. Arterial spin labeling perfusion and blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI were used to map cerebral blood flow and changes in venous oxygenation before and after intravenous infusions of placebo and psilocybin. Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned with arterial spin labeling and a separate 15 with BOLD. As predicted, profound changes in consciousness were observed after psilocybin, but surprisingly, only decreases in cerebral blood flow and BOLD signal were seen, and these were maximal in hub regions, such as the thalamus and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC and PCC). Decreased activity in the ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was a consistent finding and the magnitude of this decrease predicted the intensity of the subjective effects. Based on these results, a seed-based pharmaco-physiological interaction/functional connectivity analysis was performed using a medial prefrontal seed. Psilocybin caused a significant decrease in the positive coupling between the mPFC and PCC. These results strongly imply that the subjective effects of psychedelic drugs are caused by decreased activity and connectivity in the brain's key connector hubs, enabling a state of unconstrained cognition.},

METHODS: The participants underwent a semi-structured interview exploring the effects of psilocybin in the MRI scanner. These interviews were analysed by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The resultant data is ordered in a detailed matrix, and presented in this paper.
RESULTS: Nine broad categories of phenomenology were identified in the phenomenological analysis of the experience; perceptual changes including visual, auditory and somatosensory distortions, cognitive changes, changes in mood, effects of memory, spiritual or mystical type experiences, aspects relating to the scanner and research environment, comparisons with other experiences, the intensity and onset of effects, and individual interpretation of the experience.
DISCUSSION: This article documents the phenomenology of psilocybin when given in a novel manner (intravenous injection) and setting (an MRI scanner). The findings of the analysis are consistent with previous published work regarding the subjective effects of psilocybin. There is much scope for further research investigating the phenomena identified in this paper.},

	abstract = {Phenomenoconnectomics: The Study Of Brain Connectivity In Relation To The Phenomenology Of Altered States Of Consciousness

‘Phenomenoconnectomics’ is a meta-analytic approach to relate subjective experiences of altered states of consciousness (ASC) to modulations of brain connectivity. It builds on the assumption that similar experiences rely on similar neuronal processes. The joint study of diversely induced ASCs in recent resting-state fMRI studies requires, however, common standards in the assessment of ASC experiences. Besides pharmacological studies numerous other induction methods for ASCs are under investigation (e.g. sensory deprivation or breathing-techniques). Phenomenoconnectomics aims to derive statements such as: “When a person experience X, the brain network Y exhibits the connectivity pattern Z, independent of how X was induced.” Here, I present tools to empirically quantify ASC experiences and introduce the Altered States Database (www.asdb.info) which comprises the currently available psychometric data on diversely induced ASC experiences.

	abstract = {Introduction: In recent research, orally administered cannabidiol (CBD) showed a relatively high incidence of somnolence in a pediatric population. Previous work has suggested that when CBD is exposed to an acidic environment, it degrades to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other psychoactive cannabinoids. To gain a better understanding of quantitative exposure, we completed an in vitro study by evaluating the formation of psychoactive cannabinoids when CBD is exposed to simulated gastric fluid (SGF).Methods: Materials included synthetic CBD, Δ8-THC, and Δ9-THC. Linearity was demonstrated for each component over the concentration range used in this study. CBD was spiked into media containing 1\% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Samples were analyzed using chromatography with UV and mass spectrometry detection. An assessment time of 3 h was chosen as representative of the maximal duration of exposure to gastric fluid.Results: CBD in SGF with 1\% SDS was degraded about 85\% after 60 min and more than 98\% at 120 min. The degradation followed first-order kinetics at a rate constant of −0.031 min−1 (R2=0.9933). The major products formed were Δ9-THC and Δ8-THC with less significant levels of other related cannabinoids. CBD in physiological buffer performed as a control did not convert to THC. Confirmation of THC formation was demonstrated by comparison of mass spectral analysis, mass identification, and retention time of Δ9-THC and Δ8-THC in the SGF samples against authentic reference standards.Conclusions: SGF converts CBD into the psychoactive components Δ9-THC and Δ8-THC. The first-order kinetics observed in this study allowed estimated levels to be calculated and indicated that the acidic environment during normal gastrointestinal transit can expose orally CBD-treated patients to levels of THC and other psychoactive cannabinoids that may exceed the threshold for a physiological response. Delivery methods that decrease the potential for formation of psychoactive cannabinoids should be explored.},

	abstract = {Background:
The rate of entry of cocaine into the brain is a critical factor that influences neuronal plasticity and the development of cocaine addiction. Until now, passive diffusion has been considered the unique mechanism known by which cocaine crosses the blood-brain barrier.

Methods:
We reassessed mechanisms of transport of cocaine at the blood-brain barrier using a human cerebral capillary endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) and in situ mouse carotid perfusion.

Results:
Both in vivo and in vitro cocaine transport studies demonstrated the coexistence of a carrier-mediated process with passive diffusion. At pharmacological exposure level, passive diffusion of cocaine accounted for only 22.5\% of the total cocaine influx in mice and 5.9\% in hCMEC/D3 cells, whereas the carrier-mediated influx rate was 3.4 times greater than its passive diffusion rate in vivo. The functional identification of this carrier-mediated transport demonstrated the involvement of a proton antiporter that shared the properties of the previously characterized clonidine and nicotine transporter. The functionnal characterization suggests that the solute carrier (SLC) transporters Oct (Slc22a1-3), Mate (Slc47a1) and Octn (Slc22a4-5) are not involved in the cocaine transport in vivo and in vitro. Diphenhydramine, heroin, tramadol, cocaethylene, and norcocaine all strongly inhibited cocaine transport, unlike benzoylecgonine. Trans-stimulation studies indicated that diphenhydramine, nicotine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (ecstasy) and the cathinone compound 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) were also substrates of the cocaine transporter.

Conclusions:
Cocaine transport at the BBB involves a proton-antiporter flux that is quantitatively much more important than its passive diffusion. The molecular identification and characterization of this transporter will provide new tools to understand its role in addictive mechanisms.},

Yet, while the finding of the endocannabinoids resulted in a new effort to reveal the mechanisms regulating their levels in the brain and peripheral organs under physiological and pathological conditions, more endogenous substances with a similar action, and more molecular targets for the previously discovered endogenous ligands, anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, or for some of their metabolites, were being proposed. As the scenario becomes subsequently more complicated, and the experimental tasks to be accomplished correspondingly more numerous, we briefly review in this article the latest ‘additions’ to the endocannabinoid system together with earlier breakthroughs that have contributed to our present knowledge of the biochemistry and pharmacology of the endocannabinoids.

	abstract = {Morphine is a plant (opium poppy)-derived alkaloid and one of the strongest known analgesic compounds. Studies from several laboratories have suggested that animal and human tissue or fluids contain trace amounts of morphine. Its origin in mammals has been believed to be of dietary origin. Here, we address the question of whether morphine is of endogenous origin or derived from exogenous sources. Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids present in human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) and human pancreas carcinoma cells (DAN-G) were identified by GC/tandem MS (MS/MS) as norlaudanosoline (DAN-G), reticuline (DAN-G and SH-SY5Y), and morphine (10 nM, SH-SY5Y). The stereochemistry of reticuline was determined to be 1-(S). Growth of the SH-SY5Y cell line in the presence of 18O2 led to the [18O]-labeled morphine that had the molecular weight 4 mass units higher than if grown in 16O2, indicating the presence of two atoms of 18O per molecule of morphine. Growth of DAN-G cells in an 18O2 atmosphere yielded norlaudanosoline and (S)-reticuline, both labeled at only two of the four oxygen atoms. This result clearly demonstrates that all three alkaloids are of biosynthetic origin and suggests that norlaudanosoline and (S)-reticuline are endogenous precursors of morphine. Feeding of [ring-13C6]-tyramine, [1-13C, N-13CH3]-(S)-reticuline and [N-CD3]-thebaine to the neuroblastoma cells led each to the position-specific labeling of morphine, as established by GC/MS/MS. Without doubt, human cells can produce the alkaloid morphine. The studies presented here serve as a platform for the exploration of the function of “endogenous morphine” in the neurosciences and immunosciences.},

Since then, it has transformed from a drug that was freely available without prescription as a panacea for a broad range of disorders into a highly restricted Controlled Drug with therapeutic applications restricted to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. This review describes the relationship between chemical structure and pharmacology of amphetamine and its congeners. Amphetamine’s diverse pharmacological actions translate not only into therapeutic efficacy, but also into the production of adverse events and liability for recreational abuse. Accordingly, the balance of benefit/risk is the key challenge for its clinical use. The review charts advances in pharmaceutical development from the introduction of once-daily formulations of amphetamine through to lisdexamfetamine, which is the first d-amphetamine prodrug approved for the management of ADHD in children, adolescents and adults. The unusual metabolic route for lisdexamfetamine to deliver d-amphetamine makes an important contribution to its pharmacology. How lisdexamfetamine’s distinctive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile translates into sustained efficacy as a treatment for ADHD and its reduced potential for recreational abuse is also discussed.},

Both active drugs were significantly more effective than placebo. Dextroamphetamine seemed consistently superior to levoamphetamine, though not to a significant degree (on this size sample). Levoamphetamine seemed "slower starting," requiring three weeks to show significant benefit on target symptoms, whereas dextroamphetamine showed nearly its maximum benefit the first week. Levoamphetamine seemed better for hyperactivity and aggressiveness than for inattentiveness, whereas dextroamphetamine seemed equally beneficial for all three. These data are consistent with the possibility that therapeutic effects of amphetamine on hyperkinetic children are mediated, at least in some, by dopaminergic systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The golden age of cannabis pharmacology began in the 1960s as Raphael Mechoulam and his colleagues in Israel isolated and synthesized cannabidiol, tetrahydrocannabinol, and other phytocannabinoids. Initially, THC garnered most research interest with sporadic attention to cannabidiol, which has only rekindled in the last 15 years through a demonstration of its remarkably versatile pharmacology and synergy with THC. Gradually a cognizance of the potential of other phytocannabinoids has developed. Contemporaneous assessment of cannabis pharmacology must be even far more inclusive. Medical and recreational consumers alike have long believed in unique attributes of certain cannabis chemovars despite their similarity in cannabinoid profiles. This has focused additional research on the pharmacological contributions of mono- and sesquiterpenoids to the effects of cannabis flower preparations. Investigation reveals these aromatic compounds to contribute modulatory and therapeutic roles in the cannabis entourage far beyond expectations considering their modest concentrations in the plant. Synergistic relationships of the terpenoids to cannabinoids will be highlighted and include many complementary roles to boost therapeutic efficacy in treatment of pain, psychiatric disorders, cancer, and numerous other areas. Additional parts of the cannabis plant provide a wide and distinct variety of other compounds of pharmacological interest, including the triterpenoid friedelin from the roots, canniprene from the fan leaves, cannabisin from seed coats, and cannflavin A from seed sprouts. This chapter will explore the unique attributes of these agents and demonstrate how cannabis may yet fulfil its potential as Mechoulam's professed “pharmacological treasure trove.”},

	url = {https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/21632},
	abstract = {Adverse effects of moderate Cannabis use on physical health are subtle and rarely fatal, while Cannabis use is associated with decreased rates of obesity, diabetes mellitus, mortality from traumatic brain injury, use of alcohol and prescription drugs, driving fatalities, and opioid overdose deaths. These data suggest that Cannabis use may decrease premature deaths. To date, no studies have attempted to estimate impacts of Cannabis use on premature death that include both adverse and beneficial effects on physical health. Marijuana use is estimated to reduce premature deaths from diabetes mellitus, cancer, and traumatic brain injury by 989 to 2,511 deaths for each 1\% of the population using Cannabis. The analysis predicts an estimated 23,500 to 47,500 deaths prevented annually if medical marijuana were legal nationwide. A number of other potential causes of reduced mortality due to Cannabis use were revealed, but were excluded from the analysis because quantitative data were lacking. These estimates thus substantially underestimate the actual impact of Cannabis use on premature death. Overall, prohibition is estimated to lead to similar numbers of premature deaths as drunk driving, homicide, or fatal opioid overdose. Cannabis use prevents thousands of premature deaths each year, and Cannabis prohibition is revealed as a major cause of premature death in the U.S.},

	abstract = {Background: There is shortage of evidence about the relationship between use of cannabis and obesity. Objectives: This study aimed to examine the association between cannabis use and overweight/obesity in young adults. Methods: Data were from a 21-year follow-up of mothers and their children recruited into the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (MUSP), a longitudinal pre-birth cohort. The study is based on 2566 young adults (1264 males and 1302 females) who had data available on cannabis use and age of initiation to use of cannabis and BMI at the 21-year follow-up (MUSP children). Those who did not provide data on cannabis use and BMI were excluded from the analysis. Results: Frequency of cannabis use and body mass index (BMI) was assessed at the 21-year follow-up. Potential confounders were prospectively measured between the child's birth and the 21-year follow-up. Some 50.9\% of young adults reported use of cannabis in the last month or year and 34.1\% had BMI ≤ 25. Multivariate analysis showed that those who had used cannabis were less likely to be categorised in the BMI ≥ 25 group with the least prevalence of overweight/obesity being observed in every day cannabis users (odds ratio = .2; 95\% confidence interval [CI]:.1–.4). Conclusions and Scientific Significance: The existing data suggest lower prevalence of overweight and obesity among young adult cannabis users. Further research is needed to examine the mechanism of this association.},

	title = {Chemical and biological studies on natural and synthetic {Novel} {Psychoactive} {Substances}},
	url = {http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1432658/},
	abstract = {Over the past decade, the availability of novel psychoactive substances (NPS), so called “legal highs”, has been increasing dramatically worldwide. Natural products (NP) and synthetic compounds based on NP are amongst the most commonly offered by online vendors. Most synthetic substances have recently been introduced and very little is known about their chemical and biological properties. In this project, 18 novel synthetic NPS were selected and purchased online. The full chemical characterizations using NMR, ESI-MS, HRMS, IR and UV techniques as well as in vitro neurological assays were carried out. The chemical analysis of these compounds provided a complete set of fundamental information for future analytical, forensic and synthetic work whereas the neurological results from this study made several noteworthy contributions on pharmacological and toxicological studies. One of the most valuable findings to emerge from this study is that some substances of interest including STS-135, QUPIC, 5F-QUPIC, QUCHIC, AMT, 5-MeO-DALT, 5-EAPB, 3,4-CTMP and 4-MeO-PCP, were found to exhibit moderate to high affinity interactions to at least one neurotransmitter and receptor associated with psychoactive activity suggesting that these products had a powerful potential to generate psychedelic effects in users. Moreover, some of these substances namely 5-MeO-DALT, 5-EAPB, 3,4-CTMP, 5-MAPB and MTTA, could lead to serious adverse reactions in users as they showed appreciable affinity to the 5-HT2B receptor which is known to be associated with valvular heart diseases after long term use. Another striking finding from this study was the antibacterial activities of three related isomers isolated from a commercial sample of LY-2183240, an NPS in the cannabinoid class. A 2,5-regioisomer of LY-2183240 and a novel compound, the 5,1 isomer of LY-2183240, exhibited remarkable antibacterial activities while LY-2183240 (1,5-regioisomer) was found to possess fair activity against the tested S. aureus strains, despite the fact that the structures of these three compounds were closely related. Appreciable activities were also observed for MTTA against S. aureus, as well as 5-MeO-DALT against E. coli. For natural product NPS, whilst some are well-known, without any regulation, these materials are often of dubious identity or are adulterated with other psychoactive plants or compounds, which could cause serious harm to users. Therefore, in this research, a metabolomic approach combined with multivariate data analysis was applied to examine all the metabolites present in the four top natural product NPS (Kratom, Cacti, Fly Agaric, and Hawaiian Baby Woodrose) from various UK websites. The sample preparation, data bucketing and data analysis were developed and 1H-NMR spectroscopy was selected as a tool for sample analysis due to several advantages over other methods. An interesting finding to emerge from this study was the detection of two adulterants in the kratom sample, which were identified by a metabolomic study to possess a distinct metabolite profile compared to the rest of the kratom products. These adulterants were isolated and confirmed as oxoglaucine and glaucine which have recently been classified as NPS. This clearly suggested the practical application of 1H-NMR metabolomic technique as a rapid and efficient analytical tool to produce a valuable database for the quality control of natural product NPS and for the identification of adulterants in the future.},

	abstract = {Molecular genetic studies have identified several genes that may mediate susceptibility to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A consensus of the literature suggests that when there is a dysfunction in the “brain reward cascade,” especially in the dopamine system, causing a low or hypo-dopaminergic trait, the brain may require dopamine for individuals to avoid unpleasant feelings. This high-risk genetic trait leads to multiple drug-seeking behaviors, because the drugs activate release of dopamine, which can diminish abnormal cravings. Moreover, this genetic trait is due in part to a form of a gene (DRD2 A1 allele) that prevents the expression of the normal laying down of dopamine receptors in brain reward sites. This gene, and others involved in neurophysiological processing of specific neurotransmitters, have been associated with deficient functions and predispose individuals to have a high risk for addictive, impulsive, and compulsive behavioral propensities. It has been proposed that genetic variants of dopaminergic genes and other “reward genes” are important common determinants of reward deficiency syndrome (RDS), which we hypothesize includes ADHD as a behavioral subtype. We further hypothesize that early diagnosis through genetic polymorphic identification in combination with DNA-based customized nutraceutical administration to young children may attenuate behavioral symptoms associated with ADHD. Moreover, it is concluded that dopamine and serotonin releasers might be useful therapeutic adjuncts for the treatment of other RDS behavioral subtypes, including addictions.},

	abstract = {Antipsychotic sensitization and tolerance refer to the increased and decreased drug effects due to past drug use, respectively. Both effects reflect the long-term impacts of antipsychotic treatment on the brain and result from the brain’s adaptive response to the foreign property of the drug. In this review, clinical evidence of the behavioral aspect of antipsychotic sensitization and tolerance is selectively reviewed, followed by an overview of preclinical literature that examines these behavioral characteristics and the related pharmacological and nonpharmacological factors. Next, recent work on the developmental impacts of adolescent antipsychotic sensitization and tolerance is presented and recent research that delineates the neurobiological mechanisms of antipsychotic sensitization and tolerance is summarized. A theoretical framework based on “drug learning and memory” principles is proposed to account for the phenomena of antipsychotic sensitization and tolerance. It is maintained that antipsychotic sensitization and tolerance follow basic principles of learning or acquisition (“induction”) and memory (“expression”). The induction and expression of both effects reflect the consequences of associative and nonassociative processing and are strongly influenced by various pharmacological, environmental, and behavioral factors. Drug-induced neuroplasticity, such as functional changes of striatal dopamine D2 and prefrontal serotonin (5-HT)2A receptors and their mediated signaling pathways, in principle, is responsible for antipsychotic sensitization and tolerance. Understanding the behavioral characteristics and neurobiological underpinnings of antipsychotic sensitization and tolerance has greatly enhanced our understanding of mechanisms of antipsychotic action, and may have important implications for future drug discovery and clinical practice.},

	doi = {10.1007/s002130000532},
	abstract = {Dopamine D2 receptor upregulation in the striatum is regularly seen in response to the administration of traditional antipsychotics in animal experiments. This is associated with hyperactivity and, for this reason, D2 receptor upregulation has long been postulated as central to tardive dyskinesia (TD).
Using positron emission tomography (PET), the present study attempted to determine whether antipsychotic-induced D2 receptor up-regulation also occurs in humans.
The long-term effects of traditional and novel antipsychotics on dopamine D2 receptors were investigated in nine subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia who were deemed eligible for temporary treatment washout. Subjects had been treated with traditional antipsychotics (haloperidol n=3, perphenazine n=1) and novel antipsychotics (risperidone n=3, olanzapine n=2) in the moderate to high dosage range. Fourteen days after treatment withdrawal, the binding potentials (BPs) of dopamine D2 receptors were measured using 11[C] raclopride. The obtained BPs were compared to the BPs from antipsychotic-naive control subjects with schizophrenia.
There was a significant increase in the D2 BP in both groups combined that reached 34\%. The increases in the D2 BPs in the groups treated with conventional and novel antipsychotics were 37\% and 31\%, respectively. Significantly, the patients showing the highest degree of D2 receptor upregulation (98\%) developed severe and persistent TD shortly after being started on a new antipsychotic with low affinity for D2 receptors.
This study demonstrates for the first time, using in vivo neuroreceptor imaging, that dopamine D2 receptor binding is increased after long-term treatment with antipsychotics in humans. The data suggest that both traditional and novel antipsychotics with high affinity for dopamine D2 receptors are associated with a substantial increase in D2 receptor binding. The present data in humans agree well with animal data that implicate D2 receptor-mediated mechanisms in motor hyperactivity.},

However, little is known about the parameters of D2-receptor blockade (duration and percentage of blockade) that lead to upregulation. In this study, we investigated the effects of different degrees (60 vs {\textgreater}80\%) and durations (a transient peak vs 24 h/day) of D2-receptor blockade on inducing this upregulation. These different patterns of D2-receptor occupancy kinetics were produced in cats using bolus vs constant infusion of haloperidol for 4 weeks. D2-receptors were measured using positron emission tomography and Scatchard analyses of [11C]raclopride binding, before and after withdrawal of treatment. Continuously high (80\% for 24 h/day) D2-receptor blockade led to a robust upregulation of striatal D2-receptors that was maximal at 1-week withdrawal (35±5\%) and still detectable at 2-week withdrawal (20±3\%). This pattern of D2-receptor blockade also induced behavioral tolerance to the effect of haloperidol on spontaneous locomotor activity. Continuously moderate (60\% for 24 h/day) or transiently high (80\% for a few hours/day) D2-receptor blockade did not produce any of these effects. The long-term effect of haloperidol on D2-receptor density and behavioral tolerance thus appears to be dependent not only on a critical threshold of D2-receptor blockade but also on the daily duration of D2-receptors blockade. This suggests that as far as antipsychotics are concerned, not only dose but disbursment throughout the day have an impact on eventual pharmacodynamic and behavioral outcomes.},

	abstract = {In a short review some historical data are presented that underline the importance of the dopamine hypothesis in schizophrenia and the mechanism of action of neuroleptics. The assumption that neuroleptics are postsynaptic dopamine receptor blockers in certain areas of the brain is based on pharmacological, biochemical and clinical findings. New pharmacological data are presented which show that apomorphine, amphetamine, cocaine and caffeine in different ways and at different levels may exert agonist activity on the dopaminergic system in the brain. The agonist activity of these compounds, which is expressed by an increase in motility of the injected animals, can be antagonized by neuroleptics such as haloperidol. However, the higher the dose levels of the agonists, thus the higher the dopaminergic overstimulation, the higher the dose of haloperidol needed to normalize the motility.These data tend to confirm the dopamine hypothesis and may give some support for the use of individually adapted doses in the treatment of schizophrenia and mania,i.e. doses that match the dopaminergic overstimulation. Thus patients with high dopaminergic overstimulation need higher doses of neuroleptics than patients with low dopaminergic overstimulation. This could explain why some so-called ‘therapy-resistant’ patients, not responding to conventional doses, respond to high doses of neuroleptics. Adapted individualized dose levels, however, also mean low doses of neuroleptics in patients with a low dopaminergic overstimulation. It should be mentioned in this respect that chronic overblockade of the dopaminergic system (overdoses of neuroleptics) may be masked by the concomitant administration of antiparkinson agents and that chronic overblockade may induce dopaminergic hypersensitivity and lead to tardive dyskinesia. Also high doses of neuroleptics therefore should never be given to non-responders over long periods of time.Although dopamine seems to be a very important neurotransmitter involved in the mechanism of action of neuroleptics, it should be remembered that other neurotransmitters may also be of importance, since the activity of neuroleptics is not necessarily limited to dopamine receptor blockade and schizophrenia is such a complicated disease that its manifestations can hardly be explained by merely the overstimulation of postsynaptic dopamine receptors.},

Advances in neurobiology have challenged the simplistic dichotomy where PD is considered a disorder of high dopamine (DA), treated by DA antagonists, and ADHD a disorder of low DA, treated by DA agonists. In our paper, we review the literature on comorbid ADHD and psychosis. Treating ADHD with psychostimulants may be considered in patients with PD who have been stabilized with antipsychotics (APs). Not treating ADHD may have consequences because ADHD may predispose patients to drug abuse, which further increases the risk of PD. Nevertheless, more systematic studies are needed as there remains some uncertainty on the combined use of APs and psychostimulants in comorbid PD and ADHD.},

	abstract = {"Ecstasy", 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), an amphetamine analogue is one of the most widely used recreational drugs. In spite of the fact that neurotoxic effects of MDMA has been found in several species from rodents to non-human primates, and results increasingly point to damage also in human MDMA users, data about the sensitivity of different brain areas and the recovery after neuronal damage are scarce. Serotonin transporter (5-HTT) mRNA in the raphe nuclei also has not been examined. Humans with genetic predisposition for the slow metabolism of MDMA, the so-called "poor metabolizers" of debrisoquin are at higher risk. Five- 9\% of the Caucasian population is considered to carry this phenotype. These studies were carried out in Dark Agouti rats, a special strain that show decreased microsomal CYP2D1 isoenzyme activity, and thus may serve as a model of vulnerable human users. These works were designed to characterize MDMA-induced damage and recovery of the serotonergic system including sleep and morphological changes within 180 days. In our experiments we investigated the 5-HTT mRNA expression in the brainstem and medullary raphe nuclei, 5-HTT immunoreactive (IR) fibre densities in several brain areas, and 16 functional measures of sleep in response to a single dose of +/- MDMA (15mg{\textbackslash}kg). Furthermore, behavioural experiments were performed 21 days after MDMA treatment. We found similar changes in 5-HTT mRNA expression in the examined raphe nuclei, namely transient increases 7 days after MDMA treatment followed by transient decreases at 21 days. Significant (20-40\%), widespread reductions in 5-HTT-IR fibre density were detected in most brain areas at 7 and 21 days after MDMA administration. All cortical, but only some brainstem areas were damaged. Parallel to the neuronal damage we observed significant reductions in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency, increased fragmentation of sleep and increases in delta power spectra in non-REM sleep. At 180 days almost all functional changes in sleep were normalized together with 5-HTT mRNA expression in the examined raphe nuclei and the recovery of 5-HTT-IR fibre density in most brain areas. Our results also suggest that the acute MDMA administration abolished aggressive behaviour but MDMA pretreatment and the consequent depletion of serotonergic terminals did not affect aggression. Our findings concerning the changes detected in 5-HTT mRNA expression and fibre density indicate lasting impairment of the serotonergic system and suggest that a single use of MDMA may be associated with long-lasting cognitive, learning, memory and mood deficits and sleep disturbances particularly when a constellation of genetic vulnerability and certain environmental factors are present. Our data provide further evidence for the connection between altered serotonergic functions and sleep disturbance.},

But few scientific studies have attempted to measure or characterize hallucinogen-occasioned spiritual experiences. The present study examined the factor structure of the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), a self-report measure that has been used to assess the effects of hallucinogens in laboratory studies. Participants (N=1602) completed the 43-item MEQ in reference to a mystical or profound experience they had had after ingesting psilocybin. Exploratory factor analysis of the MEQ retained 30 items and revealed a 4-factor structure covering the dimensions of classic mystical experience: unity, noetic quality, sacredness (F1); positive mood (F2); transcendence of time/space (F3); and ineffability (F4). MEQ factor scores showed good internal reliability and correlated with the Hood Mysticism Scale, indicating convergent validity. Participants who endorsed having had a mystical experience on psilocybin, compared to those who did not, had significantly higher factor scores, indicating construct validity. The 4-factor structure was confirmed in a second sample (N=440) and demonstrated superior fit compared to alternative models. The results provide initial evidence of the validity, reliability, and factor structure of a 30-item scale for measuring single, hallucinogen-occasioned mystical experiences, which may be a useful tool in the scientific study of mysticism.},

The present study aims to investigate the possible mechanism of the hypnotic activity of theacrine. The results revealed that theacrine significantly enhanced pentobarbital-induced sleep at a dose of 3.0mg/kg (i.g.) in mice. Sleep parameter analysis by EEG and EMG showed that theacrine obviously shortened wake time and increased NREM sleep time and that theacrine almost had no effect on REM sleep. Meanwhile, theacrine markedly attenuated caffeine (a nonselective antagonist of adenosine receptor)-induced insomnia. In pretreatment with the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX and the A2A receptor antagonist SCH 58261, theacrine significantly reversed the decrease in sleeping time in pentobarbital-treated mice. In addition, theacrine also markedly increased the adenosine content in the hippocampus of rats. These results suggested that theacrine might mediate the adenosine system to augment pentobarbital-induced sleep.},

Due to their extensive metabolism, parent compounds are hardly detectable in urine. Therefore, knowledge of the metabolism of synthetic cannabinoids is essential to allow their detection in biological matrices. The aim of the present study was the elucidation of the metabolism of CUMYL-PINACA, 5F–CUMYL-PINACA, CUMYL-4CN-BINACA, 5F–CUMYL-P7AICA, and CUMYL-4CN-B7AICA with a focus on the analytical and interpretational differentiation of the compounds. Microsomal assay mixtures containing co-substrates, 10 μg/mL substrate and 1 mg/mL pooled human liver microsomes were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. Investigation of the metabolites was performed on a Thermo Fischer Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system coupled to a Sciex 6600 QTOF System. Hydroxylation was observed to be a major biotransformation step for all 5 cumyl-derivatives, followed by dihydroxylation. For CUMYL-PINACA, a major metabolic pathway was hydroxylation at the pentyl moiety, followed by a second hydroxylation at that pentyl moiety or oxidation to ketone. A major metabolic pathway for the compounds containing a nitrile function was nitrile hydrolysis followed by carboxylation and further hydroxylation. For the fluorinated compounds, oxidative defluorination and carboxylation were abundant metabolic steps. Some of the metabolic transformations lead to structurally identical metabolites, which should not be used as marker for the intake of a particular parent compound. In addition, several constitutional isomers containing either an indazole or azaindole core structure were detected, which should be differentiated by retention time rather than by their mass spectra alone.},

There was no control group. Psychological support was provided before, during, and after each session. The primary outcome measure for feasibility was patient-reported intensity of psilocybin's effects. Patients were monitored for adverse reactions during the dosing sessions and subsequent clinic and remote follow-up. Depressive symptoms were assessed with standard assessments from 1 week to 3 months after treatment, with the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) serving as the primary efficacy outcome.

Psilocybin was well tolerated by all of the patients, and no serious or unexpected adverse events occurred. The adverse reactions we noted were transient anxiety during drug onset (all patients), transient confusion or thought disorder (nine patients), mild and transient nausea (four patients), and transient headache (four patients).

After cessation of stimulation portal plasma 5-HT returned to basal levels within 10 min. Treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, in various doses (0.1-2 mg/kg b.wt.), did not abolish but significantly reduced the response to vagal stimulation, particularly during the final part of the stimulation period. The results confirm the existence of a beta-adrenoceptor-mediated release of 5-HT, but also suggest that other mechanisms for 5-HT release may be involved in the response on vagal nerve stimulation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epinephrine enhances emotional memory whereas beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers, BBs) impair it. However, the effects of BB administration on memory are sex dependent. Therefore, we predicted differential effects of epinephrine and the BB metoprolol given to male and female patients after cardiac surgery (CS) on traumatic memories and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.
METHOD: We performed a prospective observational study and determined the number of standardized traumatic memories (NTRM) and PTSD symptom intensity in cardiac surgical patients at 1 day before surgery, and at 1 week and 6 months after the procedure. PTSD symptoms and NTRM were quantified using validated questionnaires. Metoprolol could be administered any time post-operatively.
RESULTS: Baseline NTRM was not significantly different between male (n=95) and female patients (n=33). One week after CS, the NTRM in male patients was significantly higher. Metoprolol had no significant effect in either sex. At 6 months, females with metoprolol (n=18) showed a significantly lower NTRM and significantly lower PTSD symptom scores than females without BBs (n=15, p=0.02). By contrast, the totally administered dosage of epinephrine correlated with NTRM in males (r=0.33, p{\textless}0.01) but not in females (r=0.21, p=0.29).
CONCLUSIONS: beta-Adrenergic stimulation with epinephrine enhances memory for adverse experiences in males but not in females whereas beta-blockade selectively reduces memory for post-operative adverse events and PTSD symptoms in females.},

	abstract = {The treatment of anxiety is on the edge of a new era of combinations of pharmacologic and psychosocial interventions. A new wave of translational research has focused on the use of pharmacological agents as psychotherapy adjuvants using neurobiological insights into the mechanism of the action of certain psychological treatments such as exposure therapy. Recently, d-cycloserine (DCS) an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis has been applied to enhance exposure-based treatment for anxiety and has proved to be a promising, but as yet unproven intervention. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of DCS in the enhancement of exposure therapy in anxiety disorders. A systematic review/meta-analysis was conducted. Electronic searches were conducted in the databases ISI-Web of Science, Pubmed and PsycINFO. We included only randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with humans, focusing on the role of DCS in enhancing the action of exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. We identified 328 references, 13 studies were included in our final sample: 4 on obsessive-compulsive disorder, 2 on panic disorder, 2 on social anxiety disorder, 2 on posttraumatic stress disorder, one on acrophobia, and 2 on snake phobia. The results of the present meta-analysis show that DCS enhances exposure therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders (Cohen d = −0.34; CI: −0.54 to −0.14), facilitating the specific process of extinction of fear. DCS seems to be effective when administered at a time close to the exposure therapy, at low doses and a limited number of times. DCS emerges as a potential new therapeutic approach for patients with refractory anxiety disorders that are unresponsive to the conventional treatments available. When administered correctly, DCS is a promising strategy for augmentation of CBT and could reduce health care costs, drop-out rates and bring faster relief to patients.},

Histone Acetyl Transferases (HATs) and Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) are antagonistic enzymes that regulate gene expression through acetylation and deacetylation of histone proteins around which DNA is wrapped inside a eukaryotic cell nucleus. The epigenetic control of HDACs and the cellular imbalance between HATs and HDACs dictate disease states and have been implicated in muscular dystrophy, loss of memory, neurodegeneration and autistic disorders. Altering gene expression profiles through inhibition of HDACs is now emerging as a powerful technique in therapy.

The current study examined whether the type of retrieval procedure influences the ability of extinction to impair fear renewal, a form of relapse in which responding to a conditional stimulus (CS) returns outside of the extinction context. Rats first underwent Pavlovian fear conditioning with an auditory CS and footshock unconditional stimulus (US); freezing behavior served as the index of conditioned fear. Twenty-four hours later, the rats underwent a retrieval-extinction procedure. Specifically, 1h prior to extinction (45 CS-alone trials; 44 for rats receiving a CS reminder), fear memory was retrieved by either a single exposure to the CS alone, the US alone, a CS paired with the US, or exposure to the conditioning context itself. Over the next few days, conditional freezing to the extinguished CS was tested in the extinction and conditioning context in that order (i.e., an ABBA design). In the extinction context, rats that received a CS+US trial before extinction exhibited higher levels of conditional freezing than animals in all other groups, which did not differ from one another. In the renewal context, all groups showed renewal, and none of the reactivation procedures reduced renewal relative to a control group that did not receive a reactivation procedure prior to extinction. These data suggest retrieval-extinction procedures may have limited efficacy in preventing fear renewal.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Ginsenoside compound K (CK) is a candidate drug for rheumatoid arthritis therapy. This clinical trial was designed to evaluate the effects of food and sex on the pharmacokinetics of CK and its metabolite 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD). Methods: An open-label, single-center, two-period crossover trial was performed in healthy Chinese subjects (n = 24; male = 12, female = 12), randomized to either the fasting overnight or the high-fat meal group before a single 200 mg dose of monomer CK was administered. According to the concentration-time data of plasma and urine samples from each subject, the pharmacokinetic parameters of CK and 20(S)-PPD were calculated and statistically analyzed. Results: A two-way ANOVA test combined with mean plots showed no statistically significant interaction between food and sex. High-fat meal accelerated the absorption of CK, with tmax being shortened from 3.6 to 2.5 h (p = 0.015). In contrast, food significantly increased the Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf (p {\textless} 0.001) with the 90\% confidence intervals falling outside of the conventional 0.80 to 1.25. Females had higher exposure levels of CK than males, but the difference was statistically significant only after a high-fat meal. Of note, CK was rarely excreted in urine. Furthermore, the effects of food and sex were also observed on 20(S)-PPD. Conclusion: High-fat food and sex both had an impact on the disposition of CK in vivo, but rather than a significant interaction effect. High-fat food accelerated and increased the absorption of CK, while the exposure of CK was higher in females compared to males. The results indicate that food and sex should be two noteworthy factors in future research on CK. (Registration number: ChiCTR-IPR-15005787, http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx)},

	abstract = {Chronic adolescent marijuana use has been linked to the later development of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia. GABAergic hypofunction in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a cardinal pathological feature of schizophrenia and may be a mechanism by which the PFC loses its ability to regulate sub-cortical dopamine (DA) resulting in schizophrenia-like neuropsychopathology. In the present study, we exposed adolescent rats to Î”-9-tetra-hydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component in marijuana. At adulthood, we characterized the functionality of PFC GABAergic neurotransmission and its regulation of sub-cortical DA function using molecular, behavioral and in-vivo electrophysiological analyses. Our findings revealed a persistent attenuation of PFC GABAergic function combined with a hyperactive neuronal state in PFC neurons and associated disruptions in cortical gamma oscillatory activity. These PFC abnormalities were accompanied by hyperactive DAergic neuronal activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and behavioral and cognitive abnormalities similar to those observed in psychiatric disorders. Remarkably, these neuronal and behavioral effects were reversed by pharmacological activation of GABAA receptors in the PFC. Together, these results identify a mechanistic link between dysregulated frontal cortical GABAergic inhibition and sub-cortical DAergic dysregulation, characteristic of well-established neuropsychiatric endophenotypes.},

	abstract = {To investigate and compare the regulatory properties of the two isoforms of the D2 dopamine receptor, we have stably expressed their cDNAs in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Cell lines were selected that express similar levels of [3H]methylspiperone-binding activity. Both isoforms mediate a dose-dependent and pharmacologically specific inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity in both intact cell and membrane preparations. Pretreatment of both D2L and D2S receptor-expressing cells with 100 microM dopamine produces a approximately 5-fold shift (to lower affinity) in the EC50 for dopamine inhibition of cAMP accumulation, with a 25-30\% decrease in the maximum response. Dopamine treatment also results in a approximately 25\% decrease in the maximum receptor binding activity of the D2S receptor-expressing cells. In contrast, the D2L receptors are up-regulated by about 2-fold in response to dopamine exposure. This difference in response between the D2S and D2L receptors is not cell line specific, inasmuch as other CHO clones expressing these isoforms show identical responses. The dopamine-induced up-regulation of D2L receptor binding is time dependent, reaching maximal levels after 10 hr (t1/2 = 2 hr). Upon removal of dopamine, the receptor binding activity returns to control levels within 20 hr. The adenylyl cyclase desensitization response is also time dependent but exhibits a slower time course (t1/2 = 5 hr) than the receptor up-regulation. Both regulatory responses are induced in a dose-dependent fashion by dopamine, albeit with different potencies (up-regulation EC50 = 100 nM, desensitization EC50 = 2 microM). These regulatory effects are pharmacologically specific, being mimicked by D2-selective agonists but not agonists of other receptor subtypes. The dopamine-induced receptor up-regulation is blocked by prior treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin and is not mimicked by cAMP analogs. Conversely, elevation of intracellular cAMP levels results in down-regulation of the D2L receptor activity. To test whether protein synthesis is required for the D2L receptor up-regulation, cycloheximide was used to block mRNA translation. This was found to completely inhibit the up-regulation of D2L binding activity; however, there was no effect on the desensitization of the adenylyl cyclase response. RNA dot-blot analyses indicate that dopamine treatment is associated with a sustained 2-fold increase in the steady state levels of D2L mRNA, whereas D2S mRNA is transiently increased by only 50\%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The glutamatergic synapse as well as the AMPA receptor’s (AMPAR) activation may represent new potential targets for therapeutic intervention in the context of major depressive disorders. S 47445 is a novel AMPARs positive allosteric modulator (AMPA-PAM) possessing procognitive, neurotrophic properties and enhancing synaptic plasticity. Here, we investigated the antidepressant/anxiolytic-like effects of S 47445 in a mouse model of anxiety/depression based on chronic corticosterone administration (CORT) and in the Chronic Mild Stress (CMS) model in rats. Four doses of S 47445 (0.3 to 10 mg/kg, oral route, 4 and 5 weeks, respectively) were assessed in both models. In mouse, behavioral effects were tested in various anxiety-and depression-related behaviors : the elevated plus maze (EPM), open field (OF), splash test (ST), forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), fur coat state and novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) as well as on hippocampal neurogenesis and dendritic arborization in comparison to chronic fluoxetine treatment (18 mg/kg, p.o.). In rats, behavioral effects of S 47445 were monitored using sucrose consumption and compared to those of imipramine or venlafaxine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) during the whole treatment period and after withdrawal of treatments. In a mouse model of genetic ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis (GFAP-Tk model), neurogenesis dependent/independent effects of chronic S 47445 treatment were tested, as well as BDNF hippocampal expression. S 47445 reversed CORT-induced depressive-like state by increasing grooming duration and reversing coat state’s deterioration. S 47445 also decreased the immobility duration in TST and FST. The highest doses (3 and 10 mg/kg) seem the most effective for antidepressant-like activity in CORT mice. Furthermore, S 47445 significantly reversed the anxiety phenotype observed in OF (at 1 mg/kg) and EPM (from 1 mg/kg). In the CMS rat model, S 47445 (from 1 mg/kg) demonstrated a rapid onset of effect on anhedonia compared to venlafaxine and imipramine. In the CORT model, S 47445 demonstrated significant neurogenic effects on proliferation, survival and maturation of hippocampal newborn neurons at doses inducing an antidepressant-like effect. It also corrected CORT-induced deficits of growth and arborization of dendrites. Finally, the antidepressant/anxiolytic-like activities of S 47445 required adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the novelty suppressed feeding test contrary to OF, EPM and ST. The observed increase in hippocampal BDNF levels could be one of the mechanisms of S 47445 responsible for the adult hippocampal neurogenesis increase. Altogether, S 47445 displays robust antidepressant-anxiolytic-like properties after chronic administration through neurogenesis dependent/independent mechanisms and neuroplastic activities. The AMPA-PAM S 47445 could have promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of major depressive disorders or generalized anxiety disorders.},

	abstract = {Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a common and chronic disorder with substantial effects on personal and public health. The underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood but strong evidence suggests significant roles of both genetic and epigenetic components. Given that alcohol affects many organ systems, we performed a cross-tissue and cross-phenotypic analysis of genome-wide methylomic variation in AUD using samples from 3 discovery, 4 replication, and 2 translational cohorts. We identified a differentially methylated region in the promoter of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) gene that was associated with disease phenotypes. Biological validation showed that PCSK9 promoter methylation is conserved across tissues and positively correlated with expression. Replication in AUD datasets confirmed PCSK9 hypomethylation and a translational mouse model of AUD showed that alcohol exposure leads to PCSK9 downregulation. PCSK9 is primarily expressed in the liver and regulates low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Our finding of alcohol-induced epigenetic regulation of PCSK9 represents one of the underlying mechanisms between the well-known effects of alcohol on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk, with light alcohol use generally being protective while chronic heavy use has detrimental health outcomes.},

Replacing lost cells by transplanting dopaminergic neurons has potential value to repair the damaged brain. Salidroside (SD), a phenylpropanoid glycoside isolated from plant Rhodiola rosea, is neuroprotective. We examined whether salidroside can induce mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to differentiate into neuron-like cells, and convert MSCs into dopamine neurons that can be applied in clinical use. Salidroside induced rMSCs to adopt a neuronal morphology, upregulated the expression of neuronal marker molecules, such as gamma neuronal enolase 2 (Eno2/NSE), microtubule-associated protein 2 (Map2), and beta 3 class III tubulin (Tubb3/Î²-tubulin III). It also increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNAs, and promoted the secretion of these growth factors. The expression of dopamine neurons markers, such as dopamine-beta-hydroxy (DBH), dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), was significantly upregulated after treatment with salidroside for 1-12 days. DA steadily increased after treatment with salidroside for 1-6 days. Thus salidroside can induce rMSCs to differentiate into dopaminergic neurons.},

Twice daily (0900 and 1200â€‰hours), for a total of 18 months, juvenile male monkeys (8 per group) consumed either an unadulterated orange-flavored solution, a methylphenidate solution, or a dl-amphetamine mixture. Doses were titrated to reach blood/plasma levels comparable to therapeutic levels in children. [11C]MPH and [11C]raclopride dynamic PET scans were performed to image dopamine transporter and D2-like receptors, respectively. Binding potential (BPND), an index of tracer-specific binding, and amphetamine-induced changes in BPND of [11C]raclopride were estimated by kinetic modeling. There were no consistent differences among groups on the vast majority of measures, including cognitive (psychomotor speed, timing, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility), general activity, physiological (body weight, head circumference, crown-to-rump length), and neurochemical (ie, developmental changes in dopamine transporter, dopamine D2 receptor density, and amphetamine-stimulated dopamine release were as expected). Cytogenetic studies indicated that neither drug was a clastogen in rhesus monkeys. Thus, methylphenidate and amphetamine at therapeutic blood/plasma levels during peri-adolescence in non-human primates have little effect on physiological or behavioral/cognitive development.},

In this present synthesis, we integrate previous perspectives with new and older data to create a novel bipartite model centred on the view that serotonin neurotransmission enhances two distinct adaptive responses to adversity, mediated in large part by its two most prevalent and researched brain receptors: the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. We propose that passive coping (i.e. tolerating a source of stress) is mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling and characterised by stress moderation. Conversely, we argue that active coping (i.e. actively addressing a source of stress) is mediated by 5-HT2AR signalling and characterised by enhanced plasticity (defined as capacity for change). We propose that 5-HT1AR-mediated stress moderation may be the brain's default response to adversity but that an improved ability to change one's situation and/or relationship to it via 5-HT2AR-mediated plasticity may also be important - and increasingly so as the level of adversity reaches a critical point. We propose that the 5-HT1AR pathway is enhanced by conventional 5-HT reuptake blocking antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), whereas the 5-HT2AR pathway is enhanced by 5-HT2AR-agonist psychedelics. This bipartite model purports to explain how different drugs (SSRIs and psychedelics) that modulate the serotonergic system in different ways, can achieve complementary adaptive and potentially therapeutic outcomes.},

Peyote (Peyotl) is not an ordinary cactus. Itâ€™s scientific name is Lophophora williamsii. Peyote is native to Mexico and South Western Texas, where it to this can be found in arid areas rich with limestone. 
There are three properties that makes these cacti unique. 
Two of them rather trivial, the other one very important. They are spineless, they are edible, and they contain the psychoactive compound mescaline, which can also be found in numerous other cacti and even some beans. 
It was first identified in 1897 by the German chemist Arthur Heffter. But long before 1897, people already knew that they had psychedelic and entheogenic effects on the consumer, comparable to those of the modern LSD and Psilocybin, which can be found in so called magic mushrooms.

We have prepared a series of 48 compounds with structural variations in both the phenethylamine and N-benzyl part of the molecule to determine the effects on receptor binding affinity and functional activity at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. The compounds generally had high affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor with 8b having the highest affinity at 0.29 nM but with several other compounds also exhibiting sub-nanomolar binding affinities. The functional activity of the compounds was distributed over a wider range with 1b being the most potent at 0.074 nM. Most of the compounds exhibited low to moderate selectivity (1 to 40-fold) for the 5-HT2A receptor in the binding assays although one compound 6b showed an impressive 100-fold selectivity for the 5-HT2A receptor. In the functional assay selectivity was generally higher with 1b being more than 400-fold selective for the 5-HT2A receptor.},

	abstract = {Type II Diabetes affects 400 million people worldwide (IDF, 2013). The pathology is paradoxical: internal starvation activated by overfeeding. Hyperinsulinemic impairments of glucose homeostasis are treated with anti-hyperglycemics exacerbating cell starvation, inducing hypoglycemia and raising respiratory quotient. Reductions in hyperglycemia are achieved at the expense of glucose dependency and metabolic inflexibility (Gibas \& Gibas, 2017). The brain is not immune from these cycles of starvation. The bioenergetic model characterizes propagation of late-onset, sporadic Alzheimer's disease as loss of molecular fidelity and compromised energy originating in brain networks with highest metabolic demand. Impaired networks function as hubs of connectivity with other "at risk" regions causing propagation of disease to neighboring cells and compensatory up-regulation in protein synthesis, including amyloid precursor protein (Demetrius etÂ al., 2014). Impaired brain circuits are hypo-metabolic. Cerebral energy declines after stages of quasi-stable, hyper-metabolism. Elevated insulin with low bioavailable glucose cross the BBB hyper-activating neurons to preserve brain function, thereby overloading the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle. Sustained deficits reprogram the neural phenotype toward lactate driven, OXPHOS. Increased OXPHOS fosters competition between normal and "metabolically charged" neurons for limited fuel. Cerebral starvation causes apoptosis of healthy neurons due to selective disadvantage. The neuroenergetic model defines late-onset neural decline as symptomatic of "brain starvation" resulting from a physiological paradox, concurrent hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia, without an evolved cellular response. Catabolic degeneration occurs on a spectrum linear to energy deficit ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD); this pathology of cerebral starvation is known as Type III diabetes.},

Electron microscopy showed that p75(NTR) localized in dendritic spines, in addition to afferent terminals, of CA1 neurons. Deletion of p75(NTR) in mice selectively impaired the NMDA receptor-dependent LTD, without affecting other forms of synaptic plasticity. p75(NTR-/-) mice also showed a decrease in the expression of NR2B, an NMDA receptor subunit uniquely involved in LTD. Activation of p75(NTR) by proBDNF enhanced NR2B-dependent LTD and NR2B-mediated synaptic currents. These results show a crucial role for proBDNF-p75(NTR) signaling in LTD and its potential mechanism, and together with the finding that mature BDNF promotes synaptic potentiation, suggest a bidirectional regulation of synaptic plasticity by proBDNF and mature BDNF.},

Thymoquinone is a potent phytochemical with confirmed in-vitro efficacy used for several treatment purposes. The vast studies have revealed diverse molecular pathways of nearly all major diseases. Belonging to a phytochemical group, TQ is observed as strong lipophilic constituent hence insolubility in aqueous fluids hamper its systemic bioavailability. Hence, the physiochemical parameters and the associated toxicities are the barrier for the researchers using TQ clinically. Further studies revealed that TQ is highly light and heat sensitive, which obstruct the successful formulation for the delivery of drug. The present review aims to provide insights regarding the characteristics, pharmacokinetics and targets associated with the use of TQ in different pharmacological actions. It also suggests methods to improve the use of TQ by overcoming the associated physiochemical obstacles and the related toxicities and best utilisation for animal as well as clinical studies. According to the published reports of TQ, we suggest in-depth studies regarding the bioavailability and toxicity studies in animals as well as in humans.},

Acute systemic administration of E159 (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently ameliorated the DIZ(0.1mg)-induced memory deficits, and this E159(2.5mg)-provided memory-improving effects in DIZ-induced amnesia were moderately reversed when rats were pretreated with the cholinergic anatagonist scopolamine (SCO, 1 mg/kg, i.p.), H2R antagonist zolantidine (ZOL, 10 mg/kg, i.p.), but not with H1R antagonist pyrilamine (PYR, 10 mg/kg, i.p.).

Furthermore, the significant memory-enhancing effect of E159 (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) in DIZ-induced short-term memory (STM) impairment in NOR was comparable to the DOZ-provided memory-enhancing effect, and was abrogated when animals were pretreated with the histamine H3R agonist R-(α)-methylhistamine (RAMH, 10 mg/kg, i.p.). However, E159 (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) failed to provide procognitive effect on DIZ-induced long-term memory (LTM) in NOR.

	abstract = {RationaleLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and other serotonergic hallucinogens can induce profound alterations of consciousness and mystical-type experiences, with reportedly long-lasting effects on subjective well-being and personality.MethodsWe investigated the lasting effects of a single dose of LSD (200 μg) that was administered in a laboratory setting in 16 healthy participants. The following outcome measures were assessed before and 1 and 12 months after LSD administration: Persisting Effects Questionnaire (PEQ), Mysticism Scale (MS), Death Transcendence Scale (DTS), NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).ResultsOn the PEQ, positive attitudes about life and/or self, positive mood changes, altruistic/positive social effects, positive behavioral changes, and well-being/life satisfaction significantly increased at 1 and 12 months and were subjectively attributed by the subjects to the LSD experience. Five-Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) total scores, reflecting acutely induced alterations in consciousness, and Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30) total scores correlated with changes in well-being/life satisfaction 12 months after LSD administration. No changes in negative attitudes, negative mood, antisocial/negative social effects, or negative behavior were attributed to the LSD experience. After 12 months, 10 of 14 participants rated their LSD experience as among the top 10 most meaningful experiences in their lives. Five participants rated the LSD experience among the five most spiritually meaningful experiences in their lives. On the MS and DTS, ratings of mystical experiences significantly increased 1 and 12 months after LSD administration compared with the pre-LSD screening. No relevant changes in personality measures were found.ConclusionsIn healthy research subjects, the administration of a single dose of LSD (200 μg) in a safe setting was subjectively considered a personally meaningful experience that had long-lasting subjective positive effects.Trial registrationRegistration identification number: NCT01878942.},

The precursors of ELVs are made by elongation of a 22:6n3 fatty acid and catalyzed by ELOVL4 (elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids–4). The structure and stereochemistry of ELVs were established using synthetic compounds produced by stereocontrolled total synthesis. We report that ELV-mediated protection is induced in neuronal cultures undergoing either oxygen/glucose deprivation or N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor–mediated excitotoxicity, as well as in experimental ischemic stroke. The methyl ester or sodium salt of ELV-N32 and ELV-N34 resulted in reduced infarct volumes, promoted cell survival, and diminished neurovascular unit disruption when administered 1 hour following 2 hours of ischemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Together, our data reveal a novel prohomeostatic and neuroprotective lipid-signaling mechanism aiming to sustain neural cell integrity.

	abstract = {Ketamine is a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist that produces rapid antidepressant responses in individuals with major depressive disorder. The antidepressant action of ketamine has been linked to blocking NMDAR activation at rest, which inhibits eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase leading to desuppression of protein synthesis and synaptic potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Here, we investigated ketamine mediated antidepressant response and the resulting synaptic potentiation in juvenile animals. We found that ketamine did not produce an antidepressant response in juvenile animals in the novelty suppressed feeding or the forced swim test. In addition ketamine application failed to trigger synaptic potentiation in hippocampal slices obtained from juvenile animals, unlike its action in slices from adult animals. The inability of ketamine to trigger an antidepressant response or subsequent synaptic plasticity processes suggests a developmental component to ketamine mediated antidepressant efficacy. We also show that the NMDAR antagonist AP5 triggers synaptic potentiation in mature hippocampus similar to the action of ketamine, demonstrating that global competitive blockade of NMDARs is sufficient to trigger this effect. These findings suggest that global blockade of NMDARs in developmentally mature hippocampal synapses are required for the antidepressant efficacy of ketamine.},

	abstract = {There is considerable interest, from both a basic and clinical standpoint, in gaining a greater understanding of how pharmaceutical or behavioral manipulations alter fear extinction in animals. Not only does fear extinction in rodents model exposure therapy in humans, where the latter is a cornerstone of behavioral intervention for anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and specific phobias, but also understanding more about extinction provides basic information into learning and memory processes and their underlying circuitry. In this paper, we briefly review three principal approaches that have been used to modulate extinction processes in animals and humans: a purely pharmacological approach, the more widespread approach of combining pharmacology with behavior, and a purely behavioral approach. The pharmacological studies comprise modulation by: brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), d-cycloserine, serotonergic and noradrenergic drugs, neuropeptides, endocannabinoids, glucocorticoids, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and others. These studies strongly suggest that extinction can be modulated by drugs, behavioral interventions, or their combination, although not always in a lasting manner. We suggest that pharmacotherapeutic manipulations provide considerable promise for promoting effective and lasting fear reduction in individuals with anxiety disorders.},

We explored how beta-blockade might affect the course of safety learning and the subsequent return of fear in a double-blind placebo-controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging study in humans (N=46). A single dose of propranolol before extinction learning caused a loss of conditioned fear responses, and prevented the subsequent return of fear and decreased explicit memory for the fearful events in the absence of drug. Fear-related neural responses were persistently attenuated in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), increased in the hippocampus 24 h later, and correlated with individual behavioral indices of fear. Prediction error-related responses in the ventral striatum persisted during beta-blockade. We suggest that this pattern of results is most consistent with a model where beta-blockade can prevent the return of fear by (i) reducing retrieval of fear memory, via the dmPFC and (ii) increasing contextual safety learning, via the hippocampus. Our findings suggest that retrieval of fear memory and contextual safety learning form potential mnemonic target mechanisms to optimize exposure-based therapy with beta-blockers.},

A patient with treatment-resistant MDD (failing adequate trials of citalopram and vortioxetine) with loss of antidepressant response (to fluoxetine and bupropion) twice experienced a rapid-acting antidepressant effect within 48 hours of DM administration and lasting 7 days, sustained up to 20 days with daily administration, then gradually developing labile loss of antidepressant response over the ensuing 7 days. Upon full relapse in DSM-5 MDD while taking 600 mg/day of the strong CYP2D6 inhibitor bupropion XL, a 300 mg oral loading dose of DM was given, followed by 60 mg po bid after an additional dose-finding period, without side effects. DM exhibited a ketamine-like rapid-acting antidepressant effect, thought to be mediated by mTOR activation (related to NMDA PCP site antagonism, sigma-1 and beta adrenergic receptor stimulation) and 5HTT inhibition, resulting in AMPA receptor trafficking, and dendritogenesis, spinogenesis, synaptogenesis, and increased neuronal survival (related to NMDA antagonism and sigma-1 and mTOR signaling). This report appears to be the first report of a rapid-acting effect in unipolar MDD and adds to antidepressant effects observed in the retrospective chart review of 77 patients with Bipolar II Disorder (Kelly and Lieberman 2014). If replicated, there is some reason to think that the administration of other agents with DM, such as lithium or D-cycloserine, might prolong the duration of the rapid-antidepressant effect.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients exhibit T cell dysfunction, which can be regulated through mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by glutathione (GSH). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to examine the safety, tolerance, and efficacy of the GSH precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC).
METHODS: A total of 36 SLE patients received either daily placebo or 1.2 gm, 2.4 gm, or 4.8 gm of NAC. Disease activity was evaluated monthly by the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) index, the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), and the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) before, during, and after a 3-month treatment period. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential and mTOR were assessed by flow cytometry. Forty-two healthy subjects matched to patients for age, sex, and ethnicity were studied as controls.
RESULTS: NAC up to 2.4 gm/day was tolerated by all patients, while 33\% of those receiving 4.8 gm/day had reversible nausea. Placebo or NAC 1.2 gm/day did not influence disease activity. Considered together, 2.4 gm and 4.8 gm NAC reduced the SLEDAI score after 1 month (P = 0.0007), 2 months (P = 0.0009), 3 months (P = 0.0030), and 4 months (P = 0.0046); the BILAG score after 1 month (P = 0.029) and 3 months (P = 0.009); and the FAS score after 2 months (P = 0.0006) and 3 months (P = 0.005). NAC increased Δψm (P = 0.0001) in all T cells, profoundly reduced mTOR activity (P = 0.0009), enhanced apoptosis (P = 0.0004), reversed expansion of CD4-CD8- T cells (mean ± SEM 1.35 ± 0.12-fold change; P = 0.008), stimulated FoxP3 expression in CD4+CD25+ T cells (P = 0.045), and reduced anti-DNA production (P = 0.049).
CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that NAC safely improves lupus disease activity by blocking mTOR in T lymphocytes.},

However, the mechanisms underlying this action of ketamine [a glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist] have not been identified. We observed that ketamine rapidly activated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, leading to increased synaptic signaling proteins and increased number and function of new spine synapses in the prefrontal cortex of rats. Moreover, blockade of mTOR signaling completely blocked ketamine induction of synaptogenesis and behavioral responses in models of depression. Our results demonstrate that these effects of ketamine are opposite to the synaptic deficits that result from exposure to stress and could contribute to the fast antidepressant actions of ketamine.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Based on animal research several authors have warned that the application of methylphenidate, the first-line drug for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), might have neurotoxic effects potentially harming the brain. We investigated whether methylphenidate application, over a 1-year period, results in cerebral volume decrease.
METHODS: We acquired structural MRIs in a double-blind study comparing methylphenidate to placebo. Global and regional brain volumes were analyzed at baseline, after 3 months and after 12 months using diffeomorphic anatomic registration through exponentiated lie algebra.
RESULTS: We included 131 adult patients with ADHD into the baseline sample, 98 into the 3-month sample (54 in the methylphenidate cohort and 44 in the placebo cohort) and 76 into the 1-year sample (37 in the methylphenidate cohort and 29 in the placebo cohort). Methylphenidate intake compared with placebo did not lead to any detectable cerebral volume loss; there was a trend toward bilateral cerebellar grey matter increase.
LIMITATIONS: Detecting possible neurotoxic effects of methylphenidate might require a longer observation period.
CONCLUSION: There is no evidence of grey matter volume loss after 1 year of methylphenidate treatment in adult patients with ADHD.},

Interestingly, the hippocampus is one of the two structures in the adult brain where the formation of newborn neurons, or neurogenesis, persists. The level of neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus has been linked directly to cognition and mood. Therefore, modulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) by diet emerges as a possible mechanism by which nutrition impacts on mental health.

Seventeen female and male participants (black, white, and Hispanic) received placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) oral MDMA doses (comparable to recreational doses) in a double-blind, randomized, balanced, within-subject design while residing on a closed research unit. Doses were separated by 1 week or more. A fully validated two-dimensional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method simultaneously quantified MDMA, HMMA, MDA, and HMA. Calibration curves were MDA, 1 to 100 ng/mL; HMA, 2.5 to 100 ng/mL; and MDMA and HMMA, 2.5 to 400 ng/mL. Mean ± standard deviation maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 162.9 ± 39.8 and 171.9 ± 79.5 ng/mL were observed for MDMA and HMMA, respectively, after low-dose MDMA. After the high dose, mean MDMA Cmax significantly increased to 291.8 ± 76.5 ng/mL, whereas mean HMMA Cmax was unchanged at 173.5 ± 66.3 ng/mL. High intersubject variability in Cmax was observed.

In the present study, quantification of the extracellular concentration of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) from salicylic acid was used as an index of hydroxyl radical generation. Although both MDMA and D-amphetamine markedly increased the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the striatum, only MDMA increased the extracellular concentration of 2,3-DHBA. Treatment with fluoxetine either 1 h prior to or 4 h following the administration of MDMA reduced the MDMA-induced formation of 2,3-DHBA and also attenuated the MDMA-induced depletion of 5-HT in the striatum. These results are supportive of the view that the MDMA-induced generation of hydroxyl radicals and, ultimately, the long-term depletion of 5-HT, is dependent, in part, on the activation of the 5-HT transporter.},

Of interest, MDMA causes long-lasting deficits in neurochemical and histological markers of the serotonergic neurons in the brain of different animal species. Such deficits include the decline in the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase in parallel with the loss of 5-HT and its main metabolite 5-hydoxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) along with a lower binding of specific ligands to the 5-HT transporters (SERT). Of concern, reduced 5-HIAA levels in the CSF and SERT density have also been reported in human ecstasy users, what has been interpreted to reflect the loss of serotonergic fibers and terminals. The neurotoxic potential of MDMA has been questioned in recent years based on studies that failed to show the loss of the SERT protein by western blot or the lack of reactive astrogliosis after MDMA exposure. In addition, MDMA produces a long-lasting down-regulation of SERT gene expression; which, on the whole, has been used to invoke neuromodulatory mechanisms as an explanation to MDMA-induced 5-HT deficits. While decreased protein levels do not necessarily reflect neurodegeneration, the opposite is also true, that is, neuroregulatory mechanisms do not preclude the existence of 5-HT terminal degeneration.},

NMDA (40 mg/kg) induced a significant decrease in both [3H]paroxetine binding Bmax and 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels 7 days after treatment. The monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor L-deprenyl (2 mg/kg) administered 30 min before MDMA blocked these decreases. MDMA (40 mg/kg) also maximally increased the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (an indicator of lipid peroxidation) 12 hr after treatment in all three brain regions studied. This increase in malondialdehyde formation was also blocked by pretreatment with L-deprenyl. Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) activity was also significantly reduced 18 hr after MDMA. L-Deprenyl reversed this decrease in TPH activity. Another experiment confirmed that a significant fraction of [3H]dopamine uptake into hippocampal synaptosomes was blocked by 500 nM fluoxetine, a selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor. These data suggest that the deamination by monoamine oxidase-B of excessive dopamine within the 5-HT terminal generates hydrogen peroxide that may lead to membrane lipid peroxidation, and perhaps other oxidative insults, resulting in selective 5-HT terminal degeneration subsequent to MDMA treatment.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Since their initial discovery in 1989, grapefruit juice-drug interactions have received extensive interest from the scientific, medical, regulatory, and lay communities. Although knowledge regarding the effects of grapefruit juice on drug disposition continues to expand, the list of drugs studied in the clinical setting remains relatively limited.

Areas covered
This article reviews the in vitro effects of grapefruit juice and its constituents on the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes, organic anion-transporting polypeptides, P-glycoprotein, esterases and sulfotransferases. The translational applicability of the in vitro findings to the clinical setting is discussed for each drug metabolizing enzyme and transporter. Reported area under the plasma concentration-time curve ratios for available grapefruit juice-drug interaction studies are also provided. Relevant investigations were identified by searching the Pubmed electronic database from 1989 to 2010.

Expert opinion
Grapefruit juice increases the bioavailability of some orally-administered drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A and normally undergo extensive presystemic extraction. In addition, grapefruit juice can decrease the oral absorption of a few drugs that rely on organic anion-transporting polypeptides in the gastrointestinal tract for their uptake. The number of drugs shown to interact with grapefruit juice in vitro is far greater than the number of clinically relevant grapefruit juice-drug interactions. For the majority of patients, complete avoidance of grapefruit juice is unwarranted.},

In vitro naringin was a potent competitive inhibitor of caffeine 3-demethylation by human liver microsomes (Ki = 7-29 microM). 3. In vivo grapefruit juice (1.2 l day-1 containing 0.5 g l-1 naringin, the glycone form of naringenin) decreased the oral clearance of caffeine by 23\% (95\% CI: 7\%-30\%) and prolonged its half-life by 31\% (95\% CI: 20\%-44\%) (n = 12). 4. We conclude that grapefruit juice and naringenin inhibit CYP1A2 activity in man. However, the small effect on caffeine clearance in vivo suggests that in general the ingestion of grapefruit juice should not cause clinically significant inhibition of the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYPIA2.},

Very few serotonergic hallucinogens have been studied in humans in decades, despite widespread use of these drugs and potential relevance of their mechanisms to hallucinations occurring in psychiatric and neurological disorders. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the mechanisms of hallucinogen-induced visions by measuring the visual and perceptual effects of the hallucinogenic serotonin 5-HT2AR receptor agonist and monoamine releaser, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. We found that MDA increased self-report measures of mystical-type experience and other hallucinogen-like effects, including reported visual alterations. MDA produced a significant increase in closed-eye visions (CEVs), with considerable individual variation. Magnitude of CEVs after MDA was associated with lower performance on measures of contour integration and object recognition. Conclusions/Significance Drug-induced visions may have greater intensity in people with poor sensory or perceptual processing, suggesting common mechanisms with other hallucinatory syndromes. MDA is a potential tool to investigate mystical experiences and visual perception. Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00823407},

However, their specific role has not been studied in people with PTSD. Herein, we present an in vivo imaging study using positron emission tomography (PET) and the CB1-selective radioligand [11C]OMAR in individuals with PTSD, and healthy controls with lifetime histories of trauma (trauma controls [TC]) and those without such histories (healthy controls [HC]). Untreated individuals with PTSD (N=25) with non-combat trauma histories, and TC (N=12) and HC (N=23) participated in a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging scan and a resting PET scan with the CB1 receptor antagonist radiotracer [11C]OMAR, which measures volume of distribution (VT) linearly related to CB1 receptor availability. Peripheral levels of anandamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and cortisol were also assessed. In the PTSD group, relative to the HC and TC groups, we found elevated brain-wide [11C]OMAR VT values (F(2,53)=7.96, p=.001; 19.5\% and 14.5\% higher, respectively) which were most pronounced in women (F(1,53)=5.52, p=.023). Anandamide concentrations were reduced in the PTSD relative to the TC (53.1\% lower) and HC (58.2\% lower) groups. Cortisol levels were lower in the PTSD and TC groups relative to the HC group. Three biomarkers examined collectively—OMAR VT, anandamide, and cortisol—correctly classified nearly 85\% of PTSD cases. These results suggest that abnormal CB1 receptor-mediated anandamide signaling is implicated in the etiology of PTSD, and provide a promising neurobiological model to develop novel, evidence-based pharmacotherapies for this disorder.},

	abstract = {Recent in vivo structural imaging studies have shown spatial and temporal patterns of brain maturation between childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood that are generally consistent with postmortem studies of cellular maturational events such as increased myelination and synaptic pruning. In this study, we conducted detailed spatial and temporal analyses of growth and gray matter density at the cortical surface of the brain in a group of 35 normally developing children, adolescents, and young adults. To accomplish this, we used high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and novel computational image analysis techniques. For the first time, in this report we have mapped the continued postadolescent brain growth that occurs primarily in the dorsal aspects of the frontal lobe bilaterally and in the posterior temporo-occipital junction bilaterally. Notably, maps of the spatial distribution of postadolescent cortical gray matter density reduction are highly consistent with maps of the spatial distribution of postadolescent brain growth, showing an inverse relationship between cortical gray matter density reduction and brain growth primarily in the superior frontal regions that control executive cognitive functioning. Inverse relationships are not as robust in the posterior temporo-occipital junction where gray matter density reduction is much less prominent despite late brain growth in these regions between adolescence and adulthood. Overall brain growth is not significant between childhood and adolescence, but close spatial relationships between gray matter density reduction and brain growth are observed in the dorsal parietal and frontal cortex. These results suggest that progressive cellular maturational events, such as increased myelination, may play as prominent a role during the postadolescent years as regressive events, such as synaptic pruning, in determining the ultimate density of mature frontal lobe cortical gray matter.},

	issn = {1230-6002},
	abstract = {State of the art of pharmacology of tolerance to and dependence on benzodiazepine receptor ligands is shortly summarized. Firstly, the inadequacies of animal models of drug-dependency are underlined. Then, some elements of molecular biology of the GABA-A receptor complex are described to give a theoretical background for discussing pharmacological profiles of action of the selective type 1 (e.g. zolpidem), and partial benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g. bretazenil). These groups of benzodiazepine receptor ligands are considered to exhibit low tolerance and dependence liability. The evidence from behavioral and electrophysiological experiments so far favors the concept that the gradually developing hypofunction of the brain GABA system is the basis for tolerance to benzodiazepines, and the cause of abstinence symptoms. Receptor binding studies on adaptive changes in the GABA-A and benzodiazepine receptors after chronic benzodiazepine administration, insofar gave negative or contradictory results. The available up to now data on the long-term processes occurring in the subunits of the GABA-A receptor complex are also not homogenous, and it is difficult to discuss them. Likewise, the contribution of neurosteroids and specific ligands of the peripheral type of benzodiazepine receptor to the discussed phenomenona, is a matter of controversy. In conclusion, it should be stressed that the selective type 1 benzodiazepine receptor agonists, and partial benzodiazepine receptor agonists, either due to excitation of a smaller fraction of receptors, or lower efficacy, do not entirely readjust the function of the GABA-A receptor complex, thus leaving the place for action of the endogenous neurotransmitter. Such profile of central activity should prevent the development of strong tolerance and abstinence symptoms.},

The market potential for a GABAA receptor-based anxioselective resulted in multiple compounds entering clinical trials. In contrast to the anxioselective profile displayed in preclinical models, compounds such as bretazenil, TPA023, and MRK 409 produced benzodiazepine-like side effects (sedation, dizziness) in Phase I studies, whereas alpidem and ocinaplon exhibited many of the characteristics of an anxioselective in the clinic. Alpidem was briefly marketed for the treatment of anxiety, but withdrawn because of liver toxicity. Reversible elevations in liver enzymes halted development of ocinaplon in Phase III. The clinical profiles of these two molecules demonstrate that it is possible to develop GABAA receptor-based anxioselectives. However, despite the formidable molecular toolbox at our disposal, we are no better informed about the GABAA receptors responsible for an anxioselective profile in the clinic. Here, I discuss the evolution of a quest, spanning 4 decades, for molecules that retain the rapid and robust anti-anxiety actions of benzodiazepines absent the side effects that limit their usefulness.},

	issn = {1469-8978},
	doi = {10.1017/S0033291717002914},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent evidence shows that the serotonin 2A receptor (5-hydroxytryptamine2A receptor, 5-HT2AR) is critically involved in the formation of visual hallucinations and cognitive impairments in lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)-induced states and neuropsychiatric diseases. However, the interaction between 5-HT2AR activation, cognitive impairments and visual hallucinations is still poorly understood. This study explored the effect of 5-HT2AR activation on response inhibition neural networks in healthy subjects by using LSD and further tested whether brain activation during response inhibition under LSD exposure was related to LSD-induced visual hallucinations.
METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, LSD (100 µg) and placebo were administered to 18 healthy subjects. Response inhibition was assessed using a functional magnetic resonance imaging Go/No-Go task. LSD-induced visual hallucinations were measured using the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) questionnaire.
RESULTS: Relative to placebo, LSD administration impaired inhibitory performance and reduced brain activation in the right middle temporal gyrus, superior/middle/inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex and in the left superior frontal and postcentral gyrus and cerebellum. Parahippocampal activation during response inhibition was differently related to inhibitory performance after placebo and LSD administration. Finally, activation in the left superior frontal gyrus under LSD exposure was negatively related to LSD-induced cognitive impairments and visual imagery.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that 5-HT2AR activation by LSD leads to a hippocampal-prefrontal cortex-mediated breakdown of inhibitory processing, which might subsequently promote the formation of LSD-induced visual imageries. These findings help to better understand the neuropsychopharmacological mechanisms of visual hallucinations in LSD-induced states and neuropsychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {In our previous studies, we found that a single ultralow dose of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 0.002 mg/kg, three to four orders of magnitude lower than the conventional doses) protects the brain from different insults that cause cognitive deficits. Because various insults may trigger a neuroinflammatory response that leads to secondary damage to the brain, the current study tested whether this extremely low dose of THC could protect the brain from inflammation-induced cognitive deficits. Mice received a single injection of THC (0.002 mg/kg) 48 hr before or 1–7 days after treatment with lipopolysccharide (LPS; 10 mg/kg) and were examined with the object recognition test 3 weeks later. LPS caused long-lasting cognitive deficits, whereas the application of THC before or after LPS protected the mice from this LPS-induced damage. The protective effect of THC was blocked by the cannabinoid (CB) 1 receptor antagonist SR14176A but not by the CB2 receptor antagonist SR141528 and was mimicked by the CB1 agonist ACEA but not by the CB2 agonist HU308. The protective effect of THC was also blocked by pretreatment with GW9662, indicating the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. Biochemical examination of the brain revealed a long-term (at least 7 weeks) elevation of the prostaglandin-producing enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 in the hippocampus and in the frontal cortex following the injection of LPS. Pretreatment with the extremely low dose of THC tended to attenuate this elevation. Our results suggest that an ultralow dose of THC that lacks any psychotrophic activity protects the brain from neuroinflammation-induced cognitive damage and might be used as an effective drug for the treatment of neuroinflammatory conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In the LiCl-fed rats, the significant positive k* response to DOI did not differ from that in control diet rats in most brain regions, except in auditory and visual areas, where the response was absent. LiCl did not change the head turning response to DOI seen in control rats. In summary, LiCl feeding blocked PLA2-mediated signal involving AA in response to DOI in visual and auditory regions, but not generally elsewhere.

	abstract = {A series of conformationally restricted analogues of the hallucinogenic phenethylamine 1 (2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine, 2C-B) was synthesized to test several hypotheses concerning the bioactive conformation of phenethylamine ligands upon binding to the 5-HT(2A) receptor. These benzocycloalkane analogues were assayed for their receptor binding affinity and ability to activate downstream signaling pathways, and one exceptional compound was selected for testing in an in vivo drug discrimination model of hallucinogenesis. All compounds were examined in silico by virtual docking into a homology model of the 5-HT(2A) receptor. On the basis of these docking experiments, it was predicted that the R enantiomer of benzocyclobutene analogue 2 would be the most potent. Subsequent chemical resolution and X-ray crystallography confirmed this prediction, as (R)-2 proved to be equipotent to LSD in rats trained to discriminate LSD from saline. Thus, we propose that the conformation of 2 mimics the active binding conformation of the more flexible phenethylamine type hallucinogens. In addition, (R)-2 is one of the most potent and selective compounds yet discovered in the in vivo drug discrimination assay. Further, 2 was found to be a functionally selective agonist at the 5-HT(2A) receptor, having 65-fold greater potency in stimulating phosphoinositide turnover than in producing arachidonic acid release. If hallucinogenic effects are correlated with arachidonic acid production, such functionally selective 5-HT(2A) receptor agonists may lack the intoxicating properties of hallucinogens such as LSD.},

An incompletely resolved paradox is that only some 5-HT2A receptor agonists exhibit hallucinogenic activity, whereas structurally related agonists with comparable affinity and activity lack such a psychoactive activity. Using a strategy combining stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture with enrichment in phosphorylated peptides by means of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography followed by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, we compared the phosphoproteome in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing the 5-HT2A receptor and exposed to either vehicle or the synthetic hallucinogen 1-[2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl]-2-aminopropane (DOI) or the nonhallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonist lisuride. Among the 5995 identified phosphorylated peptides, 16 sites were differentially phosphorylated upon exposure of cells to DOI versus lisuride. These include a serine (Ser280) located in the third intracellular loop of the 5-HT2A receptor, a region important for its desensitization. The specific phosphorylation of Ser280 by hallucinogens was further validated by quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of immunopurified receptor digests and by Western blotting using a phosphosite specific antibody. The administration of DOI, but not of lisuride, to mice, enhanced the phosphorylation of 5-HT2A receptors at Ser280 in the prefrontal cortex. Moreover, hallucinogens induced a less pronounced desensitization of receptor-operated signaling in HEK-293 cells and neurons than did nonhallucinogenic agonists. The mutation of Ser280 to aspartic acid (to mimic phosphorylation) reduced receptor desensitization by nonhallucinogenic agonists, whereas its mutation to alanine increased the ability of hallucinogens to desensitize the receptor. This study reveals a biased phosphorylation of the 5-HT2A receptor in response to hallucinogenic versus nonhallucinogenic agonists, which underlies their distinct capacity to desensitize the receptor.},

METHODS: Eligible adults (18-65 years) were assigned to antidepressant monotherapy (escitalopram or venlafaxine extended-release) plus lisdexamfetamine dimesylate-matching placebo during an eight-week single-blind lead-in phase. Participants meeting randomization criteria were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to eight weeks of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (10, 30, 50, or 70 mg) or placebo while maintaining antidepressant therapy. Dose-responses for changes from augmentation baseline to week 16/early termination for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score (primary efficacy endpoint) and vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse) were assessed using multiple comparisons procedures with modeling.
RESULTS: For Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score change, no significant dose-responses were observed for any candidate dose-response curve (all p{\textgreater}0.10). In the dose-response evaluable population, least squares mean (90\% confidence interval) treatment differences versus placebo for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score change at week 16 were -1.4 (-3.9, 1.2), 0.1 (-2.5, 2.7), -0.7 (-3.4, 2.0), and -0.9 (-3.5, 1.6) with 10, 30, 50, and 70 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, respectively. For all vital sign parameters, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate exhibited significant dose-responses for all candidate dose-response curves (all p{\textless}0.10), with increases observed as lisdexamfetamine dimesylate dose increased; a linear relationship provided the best fit. Mean±standard deviation changes from augmentation baseline for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse at week 16/early termination were -0.7±9.90 and -0.3±7.24 mm Hg and 0.2±10.57 bpm with placebo and were 1.9±9.47 and 0.8±7.40 mm Hg and 3.6±9.74 bpm with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (all doses combined). The safety and tolerability profile of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was consistent with previous studies.

Using a strategy combining stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture with enrichment in phosphorylated peptides by means of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography followed by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, we compared the phosphoproteome in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing the 5-HT(2A) receptor and exposed to either vehicle or the synthetic hallucinogen 1-[2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl]-2-aminopropane (DOI) or the nonhallucinogenic 5-HT(2A) agonist lisuride. Among the 5995 identified phosphorylated peptides, 16 sites were differentially phosphorylated upon exposure of cells to DOI versus lisuride. These include a serine (Ser(280)) located in the third intracellular loop of the 5-HT(2A) receptor, a region important for its desensitization. The specific phosphorylation of Ser(280) by hallucinogens was further validated by quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of immunopurified receptor digests and by Western blotting using a phosphosite specific antibody. The administration of DOI, but not of lisuride, to mice, enhanced the phosphorylation of 5-HT(2A) receptors at Ser(280) in the prefrontal cortex. Moreover, hallucinogens induced a less pronounced desensitization of receptor-operated signaling in HEK-293 cells and neurons than did nonhallucinogenic agonists. The mutation of Ser(280) to aspartic acid (to mimic phosphorylation) reduced receptor desensitization by nonhallucinogenic agonists, whereas its mutation to alanine increased the ability of hallucinogens to desensitize the receptor. This study reveals a biased phosphorylation of the 5-HT(2A) receptor in response to hallucinogenic versus nonhallucinogenic agonists, which underlies their distinct capacity to desensitize the receptor.},

	abstract = {Psilocybin with psychological support is showing promise as a treatment model in psychiatry but its therapeutic mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after treatment with psilocybin (serotonin agonist) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Quality pre and post treatment fMRI data were collected from 16 of 19 patients. Decreased depressive symptoms were observed in all 19 patients at 1-week post-treatment and 47\% met criteria for response at 5 weeks. Whole-brain analyses revealed post-treatment decreases in CBF in the temporal cortex, including the amygdala. Decreased amygdala CBF correlated with reduced depressive symptoms. Focusing on a priori selected circuitry for RSFC analyses, increased RSFC was observed within the default-mode network (DMN) post-treatment. Increased ventromedial prefrontal cortex-bilateral inferior lateral parietal cortex RSFC was predictive of treatment response at 5-weeks, as was decreased parahippocampal-prefrontal cortex RSFC. These data fill an important knowledge gap regarding the post-treatment brain effects of psilocybin, and are the first in depressed patients. The post-treatment brain changes are different to previously observed acute effects of psilocybin and other ‘psychedelics’ yet were related to clinical outcomes. A ‘reset’ therapeutic mechanism is proposed.},

	abstract = {The cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, are expressed in the heart, but their role under pathological conditions remains controversial. This study examined the effect of CB1 receptor blockade on cardiovascular functions after experimental MI and in experimental metabolic syndrome. MI was induced in Wistar rats by permanent ligation of the left coronary artery. Treatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant (10 mg/kg i.p. daily) started 7 days before or 6 h after MI and continued for 6 weeks. Haemodynamic parameters were measured via echocardiography and intracardiac Samba catheter. CB1 blockade improved systolic and diastolic heart function, decreased cardiac collagen and hydroxyproline content and down-regulated TGF-β1. Additionally, rimonabant decreased arterial stiffness, normalised QRS complex duration and reduced brain natriuretic peptide levels in serum. In primary cardiac fibroblasts, rimonabant decreased MMP-9 activity and TGF-β1 expression. Furthermore, rimonabant improved depressed systolic function of spontaneously hypertensive obese rats and reduced weight gain. Blocking of CB1 receptor with rimonabant improves cardiac functions in the early and late stages after MI, decreases arterial stiffness and reduces cardiac remodelling. Rimonabant also has cardioprotective actions in rats characterised by the metabolic syndrome. Inhibition of proteolysis and TGF-β1 expression and reduced collagen content by rimonabant may attenuate destruction of the extracellular matrix and decrease fibrosis after MI.},

	abstract = {Sixteen male Fischer-344N rats were trained on a eight-arm radial maze task for food reinforcement. The effects of various doses of baclofen (1.25 or 2.50 mg/kg) and scopolamine (0.188, 0.375, and 0.750 mg/kg) were determined alone and in combination. Relative to vehicle controls, baclofen alone did not affect performance in the radial arm maze (number correct in the first eight responses, total errors) or the time required to complete the maze. Scopolamine alone decreased the number of correct responses in the first eight arm choices, while increasing both the number of errors and the time necessary to complete the maze. When the two drugs were co-administered, baclofen had no effect on the number of errors or time required to complete the maze in the presence of scopolamine; however, in combination with the high dose of scopolamine, it significantly increased the number of errors made during the first eight choices. Baclofen thus can exacerbate some radial arm maze dificits produced by an anticholinergic drug. In a subsequent experiment to test the interaction between scopolamine and baclofen using a nonlearned behavior, baclofen (1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg) did not affect motor activity, whereas all doses of scopolamine (0.188-0.75 mg/kg) increased activity. The higher dose of baclofen attenuated scopolamine-induced hypermotility by 50\%, but the lower dose of baclofen was not effective. These data demonstrate pharmacological interactions between baclofen, a drug used clinically for spaticity, and a drug having anticholinergic properties.},

Method:the medical records of elderly patients hospitalized in the medical wards of a teaching hospital were analyzed with the ARS, translated and adapted for medicines used in Brazil. The version of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) for the clinical diagnosis of delirium translated and validated by Fabbri et al. was used. Individuals aged ≥60 years were included in the evaluation of drug use. The sample was divided by gender and age to analyze the effect of these variables on the use of anticholinergic drugs based on the ARS, and association with delirium. Results:123 elderly persons, 47 men and 76 women, with a mean age of 72.7(±9.2) years were included. The average consumption of drugs not listed in the ARS (some with anticholinergic action as Ipratropium and Scopolamine) was 6.1(±3.0) and the average number of drugs used listed in the ARS (Metoclopramide, Ranitidine, Atropine, Haloperidol and Risperidone) was 0.9±0.6. Four elderly persons had a score ≥3 (3.3\% of total cases). Delirium was observed in 27 patients (21.9\% of the total), none of whom scored more than two ARS points. There was no statistical significance regarding gender, age and delirium. Conclusion:the average score of the ARS was low among this population, and did not correlate with delirium. The ARS does not cover all anticholinergics, meaning this study should be repeated in a geriatric ward for comparison.Keywords: Elderly; Cholinergic Antagonists; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Iatrogenic Disease.},

METHODS: We reviewed all the observations of cardiovascular ADRs with memantine reported to the French PharmacoVigilance Database up to May 2007. We recorded the characteristics of patients (age, sex and underlying disease) and of ADRs (nature, seriousness, delay in occurrence, evolution, imputability).
RESULTS: After exclusion of 16 cases, the cardiac origin of which was not clearly assessed, 36 cardiac ADRs with memantine were recorded between its commercialisation in France (July 2003) and May 2007. These ADRs consisted of 18 reports of bradycardia and 18 reports of various cardiovascular ADRs (orthostatic hypotension with fall[6] electrocardiogram perturbations[4] fainting[2] malaise with arterial hypotension[2] arterial hypotension and acute renal failure[1] fatal heart failure[1] sudden death[2]). Among the 18 reports of bradycardia, 7 cases occurred with memantine as the sole suspected drug and all but one resolved after memantine's discontinuation.
CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular properties of memantine seem to be complex and remain quite unclear. Despite its drawbacks and its descriptive design, our study suggests that memantine could determine some cardiac ADRs, especially bradycardia; the mechanism of which remains unexplained.},

The efficacy of SJW is obviously defined by a range of parallel mechanisms of action, triggered by different constituents. In vitro research showed, among other tests, positive effects in neurotransmitter regulation (in beta adrenergic systems and glutamate receptors) and ion channel conductance. Antidepressant effects were confirmed in typical in vivo models such as the forced swimming test, the open field test, the tail suspension test, or a model of stress-impaired memory. The overall effect cannot be attributed to a single constituent or fraction.

	abstract = {L-dopa may be toxic to dopamine neurons, possibly due to catechol-autoxidation. Catechols are O-methylated by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in a SAM consuming reaction, preventing the initiation of catechol autoxidation. We hypothesized that SAM or SAM-precursors ameliorate L-dopa neurotoxicity, in a COMT-dependent fashion. We tested this hypothesis in primary mesencephalic cultures by adding 200 microM L-dopa with 2 mM methionine or 1 mM dimethionine or 0.5 mM SAM with or without 0.2 microM of the COMT-inhibitor 2', 5'-dinitrocatechol (OR 486). L-dopa was found to be neurotoxic as the surviving neurons had fewer and shorter processes. Methionine, dimethionine and SAM all protected DA neurons against damaged induced by L-dopa. The COMT inhibitor dinitrocatechol (DNC) completely abolished the protective effect against L-dopa toxicity. We conclude that supplementation with methionine, dimethionine or SAM ameliorates L-dopa neurotoxicity to dopamine neurons, while inhibition of COMT may aggravate or unmask L-dopa neurotoxicity.},

	abstract = {The striatum has an essential role in neural control of instrumental behaviors by reinforcement learning. Adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) are highly enriched in the striatopallidal neurons and are implicated in instrumental behavior control. However, the temporal importance of the A2AR signaling in relation to the reward and specific contributions of the striatopallidal A2ARs in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) to the control of instrumental learning are not defined. Here, we addressed temporal relationship and sufficiency of transient activation of optoA2AR signaling precisely at the time of the reward to the control of instrumental learning, using our newly developed rhodopsin-A2AR chimeras (optoA2AR). We demonstrated that transient light activation of optoA2AR signaling in the striatopallidal neurons in ‘time-locked’ manner with the reward delivery (but not random optoA2AR activation) was sufficient to change the animal’s sensitivity to outcome devaluation without affecting the acquisition or extinction phases of instrumental learning. We further demonstrated that optogenetic activation of striatopallidal A2AR signaling in the DMS suppressed goal-directed behaviors, as focally genetic knockdown of striatopallidal A2ARs in the DMS enhanced goal-directed behavior by the devaluation test. By contrast, optogenetic activation or focal AAV-Cre-mediated knockdown of striatopallidal A2AR in the DLS had relatively limited effects on instrumental learning. Thus, the striatopallidal A2AR signaling in the DMS exerts inhibitory and predominant control of goal-directed behavior by acting precisely at the time of reward, and may represent a therapeutic target to reverse abnormal habit formation that is associated with compulsive obsessive disorder and drug addiction.},

	abstract = {Background Reducing meat consumption is often advised; however, inadvertent nutritional deficiencies during pregnancy may result in residual neurodevelopmental harms to offspring. This study assessed possible effects of maternal diets in pregnancy on adverse substance use among adolescent offspring. Methods Pregnant women and their 13-year-old offspring taking part in a prospective birth cohort study, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), provided Food Frequency Questionnaire data from which dietary patterns were derived using principal components analysis. Multivariable logistic regression models including potential confounders evaluated adverse alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco use of the children at 15 years of age. Results Lower maternal meat consumption was associated with greater problematic substance use among 15-year-old offspring in doseâ€“response patterns. Comparing never to daily meat consumption after adjustment, risks were greater for all categories of problem substance use: alcohol, odds ratio OR = 1.75, 95\% CI = (1.23, 2.56), p {\textless} 0.001; tobacco use OR = 1.85, 95\% CI = (1.28, 2.63), p {\textless} 0.001; and cannabis OR = 2.70, 95\% CI = (1.89, 4.00), p {\textless} 0.001. Given the likelihood of residual confounding, potential causality was evaluated using stratification for maternal allelic variants that impact biological activity of cobalamin (vitamin B12) and iron. Lower meat consumption disproportionally increased the risks of offspring substance misuse among mothers with optimally functional (homozygous) variants (rs1801198) of the gene transcobalamin 2 gene (TCN2) which encodes the vitamin B12 transport protein transcobalamin 2 implicating a causal role for cobalamin deficits. Functional maternal variants in iron metabolism were unrelated to the adverse substance use. Risks potentially attributable to cobalamin deficits during pregnancy include adverse adolescent alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco use (14, 37, and 23, respectively). Conclusions Lower prenatal meat consumption was associated with increased risks of adolescent substance misuse. Interactions between TCN2 variant status and meat intake implicate cobalamin deficiencies.},

	abstract = {Hyperforin is a pharmacologically active component of the medicinal plant Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort), recommended as a treatment for a range of ailments including mild to moderate depression. Part of its action has been attributed to TRPC6 channel activation. We found that hyperforin induces TRPC6-independent H+ currents in HEK-293 cells, cortical microglia, chromaffin cells and lipid bilayers. The latter demonstrates that hyperforin itself acts as a protonophore. The protonophore activity of hyperforin causes cytosolic acidification, which strongly depends on the holding potential, and which fuels the plasma membrane sodium-proton exchanger. Thereby the free intracellular sodium concentration increases and the neurotransmitter uptake by Na+ cotransport is inhibited. Additionally, hyperforin depletes and reduces loading of large dense core vesicles in chromaffin cells, which requires a pH gradient in order to accumulate monoamines. In summary the pharmacological actions of the “herbal Prozac” hyperforin are essentially determined by its protonophore properties shown here.},

Using mouse models, we show that menthol enhances nicotine-induced changes in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed on midbrain DA neurons.

In a conditioned place preference (CPP) assay, we observed that menthol plus nicotine produces greater reward-related behavior than nicotine alone. Our results connect changes in midbrain DA neurons to menthol-induced enhancements of nicotine reward-related behavior and may help explain how smokers of menthol cigarettes exhibit reduced cessation rates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Smokers are exposed to significant doses of carcinogens, including tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs). Previous studies have shown significant global differences in the levels of TSNAs in cigarette smoke because of the variation in tobacco blending and curing practices around the world.

METHODS
Mouth-level exposure to 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) measured in cigarette butts and urinary concentrations of its major metabolite 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) were examined among 126 daily smokers in four countries over a 24-hour study period.

RESULTS
As mouth-level exposure of NNK increased, the urinary NNAL increased, even after adjustment for other covariates (β=0.46, p=0.004). The relationship between mouth-level exposure to nicotine and its salivary metabolite, cotinine, was not statistically significant (β=0.29, p=0.057), likely because of the very limited range of differences in mouth-level nicotine exposure in this population.

CONCLUSIONS
We have demonstrated a direct association between the 24-hour mouth level exposure of NNK resulting from cigarette smoking and the concentration of its primary metabolite, NNAL, in the urine of smokers. Internal dose concentrations of urinary NNAL are significantly lower in smokers in countries which have lower TSNA levels in cigarettes such as Canada and Australia in contrast to countries which have high levels of these carcinogens in cigarettes, such as the United States.

IMPACT
Lowering the levels of NNK in the mainstream smoke of cigarettes through the use of specific tobacco types and known curing practices can significantly impact the exposure of smokers to this known carcinogen.},

There was a significant effect of smoking status on baseline striatal D2R availability; with current smokers showing lower striatal D2R availability compared with nonsmokers (caudate, putamen, and ventral striatum) and with ex-smokers (caudate and putamen). Baseline striatal D2R did not differ between nonsmokers and ex-smokers. The effect of smoking status on methylphenidate-induced DA release tended to be lower in smokers but the difference was not significant (p=0.08). For behavioral measures, current smokers showed significantly higher aggression scores compared with both nonsmokers and ex-smokers. These results suggest that with abstinence ex-smokers may recover from low striatal D2R availability and from increased behavioral aggression seen in active smokers.

An animal model called “ABA renewal procedure” has been used to study the context-induced relapse to drug seeking. Here, we reported a new and feasible training procedure for the ABA renewal method to explore the role of the prelimbic cortex in context-induced relapse to ethanol seeking. By using a saccharin fading technique, we trained rats to self-administer ethanol (10\%). The drug delivery was paired with a discrete tone-light cue. Lever pressing was subsequently extinguished in a non-drug-associated context in the presence of the discrete cue. Rats were subsequently tested for reinstatement in contexts A or B, under extinction conditions. Ethanol-associated context induced the reinstatement of ethanol seeking and increased the expression of Fos in the prelimbic cortex. The rate of neural activation in the prelimbic cortex was 3.4\% in the extinction context B and 7.7\% in the drug-associated context A, as evidenced by double-labeling of Fos and the neuron-specific protein NeuN. The reversible inactivation of the neural activity in the prelimbic cortex with gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists (muscimol + baclofen) attenuated the context-induced reinstatement of ethanol self-administration. These results demonstrated that the neuronal activation of the prelimbic cortex is involved in the context-induced reinstatement of ethanol seeking.},

Both fear and drug seeking are conditioned responses that can lead to maladaptive behavior when expressed inappropriately, manifesting as anxiety disorders and addiction, respectively. Recent evidence indicates that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is critical for the extinction of both fear and drug-seeking behaviors. Moreover, a dorsal-ventral distinction is apparent within the mPFC, such that the prelimbic (PL-mPFC) cortex drives the expression of fear and drug seeking, whereas the infralimbic (IL-mPFC) cortex suppresses these behaviors after extinction. For conditioned fear, the dorsal-ventral dichotomy is accomplished via divergent projections to different subregions of the amygdala, whereas for drug seeking, it is accomplished via divergent projections to the subregions of the nucleus accumbens. Given that the mPFC represents a common node in the extinction circuit for these behaviors, treatments that target this region may help alleviate symptoms of both anxiety and addictive disorders by enhancing extinction memory.},

The ACC is a structure that sits at the intersection of several task-positive networks (eg, central executive network, CEN), which are still developing during adolescence. While recent work using seed-based approaches indicate that depressed adolescents show limited task-evoked vs resting-state connectivity (termed ‘inflexibility’) between the ACC and task-negative networks, no study has used network-based approaches to investigate inflexibility of the ACC in task-positive networks to understand adolescent MDD. Here, we used graph theory to compare flexibility of network-level topology in eight subregions of the ACC (spanning three task-positive networks) in 42 unmedicated adolescents with MDD and 53 well-matched healthy controls. All participants underwent fMRI scanning during resting state and a response inhibition task that robustly engages task-positive networks. Relative to controls, depressed adolescents were characterized by inflexibility in local efficiency of a key ACC node in the CEN: right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/medial frontal gyrus (R dACC/MFG). Furthermore, individual differences in flexibility of local efficiency of R dACC/MFG significantly predicted inhibition performance, consistent with current literature demonstrating that flexible network organization affords successful cognitive control. Finally, reduced local efficiency of dACC/MFG during the task was significantly associated with an earlier age of depression onset, consistent with prior work suggesting that MDD may alter functional network development. Our results support a neurodevelopmental hypothesis of MDD wherein dysfunctional self-regulation is potentially reflected by altered ACC maturation.},

	abstract = {All modern clinical studies using the classic hallucinogen lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in healthy subjects or patients in the last 25 years are reviewed herein. There were five recent studies in healthy participants and one in patients. In a controlled setting, LSD acutely induced bliss, audiovisual synesthesia, altered meaning of perceptions, derealization, depersonalization, and mystical experiences. These subjective effects of LSD were mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor. LSD increased feelings of closeness to others, openness, trust, and suggestibility. LSD impaired the recognition of sad and fearful faces, reduced left amygdala reactivity to fearful faces, and enhanced emotional empathy. LSD increased the emotional response to music and the meaning of music. LSD acutely produced deficits in sensorimotor gating, similar to observations in schizophrenia. LSD had weak autonomic stimulant effects and elevated plasma cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin levels. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance studies showed that LSD acutely reduced the integrity of functional brain networks and increased connectivity between networks that normally are more dissociated. LSD increased functional thalamocortical connectivity and functional connectivity of the primary visual cortex with other brain areas. The latter effect was correlated with subjective hallucinations. LSD acutely induced global increases in brain entropy that were associated with greater trait openness 14 days later. In patients with anxiety associated with life-threatening disease, anxiety was reduced for 2 months after two doses of LSD. In medical settings, no complications of LSD administration were observed. These data should contribute to further investigations of the therapeutic potential of LSD in psychiatry.},

	abstract = {Cross-sectional studies of the effects of cannabis on cognition in schizophrenia have produced mixed results. Heavy and persistent cannabis use in schizophrenia is a common clinical problem, and effects of controlled abstinence from cannabis in these patients have not been carefully evaluated. The present study sought to determine the effects of cannabis abstinence on cognition in patients with schizophrenia and co-occurring cannabis dependence. We utilized a 28-day cannabis abstinence paradigm to investigate the state-dependent effects of cannabis on select cognitive outcomes in cannabis-dependent patients with schizophrenia and non-psychiatric controls. Nineteen patients and 20 non-psychiatric male cannabis-dependent participants underwent 28 days of cannabis abstinence. Cognition was assessed on day 0, 14, and 28 using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Clinical symptoms were assessed weekly. Abstinence was facilitated by contingency reinforcement confirmed by twice weekly urinalysis. Forty-two percent of patients and 55\% of controls achieved end-point abstinence (p=0.53), which was biochemically-verified (day 28 urinary THC-COOH {\textless}20 ng/ml). In this preliminary study, schizophrenia-abstainers demonstrated improvements in Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) performance over time [F(2,14)=4.73, p{\textless}0.03] (d=1.07). Lesser improvements on HVLT-R were observed in non-psychiatric control abstainers (d=0.66), and with abstinence on other cognitive test measures, in both patients and controls. Verbal memory and learning may improve in schizophrenia and control subjects with cannabis abstinence, but larger more definitive studies are needed. Our findings underscore the importance of developing effective interventions for cannabis use disorders in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Neuroactive steroids are naturally occurring steroids, which are synthesized centrally as de novo from cholesterol and are classified as pregnane, androstane, and sulfated neurosteroids. Neuroactive steroids modulate many processes via interacting with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), N-methyl-D-aspartate, serotonin, voltage-gated calcium channels, voltage-dependent anion channels, α-adrenoreceptors, X-receptors of the liver, transient receptor potential channels, microtubule-associated protein 2, neurotrophin nerve growth factor, and σ1 receptors. Among these, neurosteroids (especially allopregnanolone) have high potency and extensive GABA-A receptors and hence demonstrate anticonvulsant, anesthetic, central cytoprotectant and baroreflex inhibitory effects. Neurosteroids are also involved in mood and learning via serotonin and anti-nociceptive activity via T-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Moreover, they are modulators of mitochondrial function, synaptic plasticity, or regulators of apoptosis, which have a role in neuroprotective via voltage- dependent anion channels receptors. For proper functioning, neuroactive steroids need to be in their normal level whereas excess and deficiency may lead to abnormalities. When they are below the normal, neurosteroids could have a part in development of depression, neuro-inflammation, multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), epilepsy, and schizophrenia. On the other hand, stress and attention deficit disorder could occur during excessive level. Overall, neuroactive steroids are very important molecules with major neuropsychiatric activity.},

	abstract = {Neuropharmacological effects of psychedelics have profound cognitive, emotional and social effects that inspired the development of cultures and religions worldwide. Findings that psychedelics objectively and reliably produce mystical experiences press the question of the neuropharmacological mechanisms by which these highly significant experiences are produced by exogenous neurotransmitter analogues. Humans have a long evolutionary relationship with psychedelics, a consequence of psychedelicsâ€™ selective effects for human cognitive abilities, exemplified in the information rich visionary experiences. Objective evidence that psychedelics produce classic mystical experiences, coupled with the finding that hallucinatory experiences can be induced by many non-drug mechanisms, illustrates the need for a common model of visionary effects. Several models implicate disturbances of normal regulatory processes in the brain as the underlying mechanisms responsible for the similarities of visionary experiences produced by psychedelic and other methods for altering consciousness. Similarities in psychedelic-induced visionary experiences and those produced by practices such as meditation and hypnosis and pathological conditions such as epilepsy indicate the need for a general model explaining visionary experiences. Common mechanisms underlying diverse alterations of consciousness involve the disruption of normal functions of the prefrontal cortex and default mode network. This interruption of ordinary control mechanisms allows for the release of thalamic and other lower brain discharges that stimulate a visual information representation system and release the effects of innate cognitive functions and operators. Converging forms of evidence support the hypothesis that the source of psychedelic experiences involves the emergence of these innate cognitive processes of lower brain systems, with visionary experiences resulting from the activation of innate processes based in the mirror neuron system.},

	abstract = {Extinction is a form of inhibitory learning that suppresses a previously conditioned response. Both fear and drug seeking are conditioned responses that can lead to maladaptive behavior when expressed inappropriately, manifesting as anxiety disorders and addiction, respectively. Recent evidence indicates that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is critical for the extinction of both fear and drug-seeking behaviors. Moreover, a dorsal-ventral distinction is apparent within the mPFC, such that the prelimbic (PL-mPFC) cortex drives the expression of fear and drug seeking, whereas the infralimbic (IL-mPFC) cortex suppresses these behaviors after extinction. For conditioned fear, the dorsal-ventral dichotomy is accomplished via divergent projections to different subregions of the amygdala, whereas for drug seeking, it is accomplished via divergent projections to the subregions of the nucleus accumbens. Given that the mPFC represents a common node in the extinction circuit for these behaviors, treatments that target this region may help alleviate symptoms of both anxiety and addictive disorders by enhancing extinction memory.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00213-006-0576-z},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of serotonin (5-HT) in the effects of oral 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in humans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjective and physiological effects of 1.5 mg/kg MDMA were evaluated after 20 mg fluoxetine in eight recreational MDMA users in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. During phase 1, participants were maintained on placebo for at least 5 days and tested with MDMA and placebo on separate sessions. In phase 2, the procedure was the same except fluoxetine was administered daily for at least 5 days. During sessions, placebo or fluoxetine was given 1 h before the session drug and effects were measured over the next 7 h.
RESULTS: MDMA increased positive-like subjective effects on all the Addiction Research Center Inventory scales; Arousal, Elation, Positive Mood, and Vigor on the Profile of Mood States; Drug Liking, Friendly, Good Drug Effect, High, Stimulated, and Talkative on the Visual Analog Scale; and End-of-Session Liking and Crossover Point on the Multiple Choice Procedure. MDMA also increased measures of anxiety. On the Hallucinogenic Rating Scale, all scales except Volition were increased. MDMA also increased blood pressure and heart rate. Fluoxetine treatment attenuated most of the positive-like subjective effects including the Affect and Soma scales of the Hallucinogen Rating Scale. In addition, heart rate but not blood pressure increases were reduced.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that blockade of 5-HT reuptake by fluoxetine can dampen the effects of MDMA and further supports the role of 5-HT in its behavioral effects in humans.},

In vitro, duloxetine blocked the release of both 5-HT and NE by MDMA or by its metabolite 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine from transmitter-loaded human cells expressing the 5-HT or NE transporter. In humans, duloxetine inhibited the effects of MDMA including elevations in circulating NE, increases in blood pressure and heart rate, and the subjective drug effects. Duloxetine inhibited the pharmacodynamic response to MDMA despite an increase in duloxetine-associated elevations in plasma MDMA levels. The findings confirm the important role of MDMA-induced 5-HT and NE release in the psychotropic effects of MDMA. Duloxetine may be useful in the treatment of psychostimulant dependence.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: At present, there are scarce clinical and basic lab data concerning the risk of acute serotonin toxicity from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) co-administration. The health care community can strongly benefit from efforts to address the high risks associated with serotonin syndrome from this specific drug combination.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to review the risk of serotonin syndrome in adolescents and young adults prescribed with SSRIs and are concurrently using ecstasy.
DATA SOURCES: An electronic search of the major behavioral science bibliographic databases (Pubmed, PsycINFO, Medline) was conducted to retrieve peer-reviewed articles, which detail the clinical characteristics, biological mechanisms and social implications of SSRIs, MDMA, and their potential synergism in causing serotonin syndrome in the pediatric and young adult population. Search terms included "serotonin syndrome", "ecstasy", "MDMA", "pediatric", and "SSRI". Additional references were incorporated from the bibliographies of these retrieved articles.
RESULTS: MDMA, in combination with the widely-prescribed SSRI antidepressant class, can lead to rapid, synergistic rise of serotonin (5-HT) concentration in the central nervous system, leading to the acute medical emergency known as serotonin syndrome. This review addresses such complication through an exploration of the theoretical mechanisms and clinical manifestations of this life-threatening pharmacological interaction.
CONCLUSION: The increasing incidences of recreational ecstasy use and SSRI pharmacotherapy among multiple psychiatric disorders in the adolescent population have made this an overlooked yet increasingly relevant danger, which poses a threat to public health. This can be curbed through further research, as well as greater health care provision and attention from a regulatory body owing.},

MDMA produced a dose-dependent increase in the extracellular concentration of 5-HT in the striatum and prefrontal cortex that was attenuated by treatment with fluoxetine but not by tetrodotoxin. Suppression by fluoxetine of the MDMA-induced release of 5-HT was accompanied by a suppression of the MDMA-induced release of dopamine. Administration of MDMA to rats treated with carbidopa and L-5-hydroxytryptophan resulted in a synergistic elevation of the extracellular concentration of 5-HT that was much greater than that produced by either treatment alone. The MDMA-induced release of dopamine by MDMA also was potentiated in 5-hydroxytryptophan-treated rats. These data are consistent with the view that MDMA increases the extracellular concentration of 5-HT by facilitating carrier-mediated 5-HT release, which can be enhanced greatly under conditions in which 5-HT synthesis is stimulated. Moreover, these data are supportive of a state-dependent, stimulatory role of 5-HT in the regulation of dopamine release.},

	abstract = {Background
Most patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) experience a period of lengthy trial-and-error when trying to find optimal antidepressant treatment; identifying biomarkers that could predict response to antidepressant treatment would be of enormous benefit. We tested the hypothesis that pre-treatment anterior cingulate (ACC) activity could be a putative biomarker of rapid antidepressant response to ketamine, in line with previous findings that investigated the effects of conventional antidepressants. We also investigated patterns of ACC activity to rapid presentation of fearful faces compared to the normal habituation observed in healthy subjects.

Methods
We elicited ACC activity in drug-free patients with MDD (N=11) and healthy controls (N=11) by rapidly presenting fearful faces, a paradigm known to activate rostral regions of the ACC. Spatial-filtering analyses were performed on magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings, which offer the temporal precision necessary to estimate ACC activity elicited by the rapid presentation of stimuli. MEG recordings were obtained only once for both patients and controls. Patients were subsequently administered a single ketamine infusion followed by assessment of depressive symptoms four hours later.

Results
Although healthy subjects had decreased neuromagnetic activity in the rostral ACC across repeated exposures, patients with MDD showed robust increases in pretreatment ACC activity. Notably, this increase was positively correlated with subsequent rapid antidepressant response to ketamine. Exploratory analyses showed that pretreatment amygdala activity was negatively correlated with change in depressive symptoms.

Conclusion
Pretreatment rostral ACC activation may be a useful biomarker that identifies a subgroup of patients who will respond favorably to ketamineâ€™s antidepressant effects.},

	abstract = {A single sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine exerts rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. Here, we examined the role of the ventral hippocampus (vHipp)-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pathway in ketamine’s antidepressant response. Inactivation of the vHipp with lidocaine prevented the sustained, but not acute, antidepressant-like effect of ketamine as measured by the forced swim test (FST). Moreover, optogenetic as well as pharmacogenetic specific activation of the vHipp–mPFC pathway using DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) mimicked the antidepressant-like response to ketamine; importantly, this was pathway specific, in that activation of a vHipp to nucleus accumbens circuit did not do this. Furthermore, optogenetic inactivation of the vHipp/mPFC pathway at the time of FST completely reversed ketamine’s antidepressant response. In addition, we found that a transient increase in TrkB receptor phosphorylation in the vHipp contributes to ketamine’s sustained antidepressant response. These data demonstrate that activity in the vHipp–mPFC pathway is both necessary and sufficient for the antidepressant-like effect of ketamine.},

	abstract = {Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) has been demonstrated to reduce symptom severity in conditions such as fibromyalgia, Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and complex regional pain syndrome. We review the evidence that LDN may operate as a novel anti-inflammatory agent in the central nervous system, via action on microglial cells. These effects may be unique to low dosages of naltrexone and appear to be entirely independent from naltrexone’s better-known activity on opioid receptors. As a daily oral therapy, LDN is inexpensive and well-tolerated. Despite initial promise of efficacy, the use of LDN for chronic disorders is still highly experimental. Published trials have low sample sizes, and few replications have been performed. We cover the typical usage of LDN in clinical trials, caveats to using the medication, and recommendations for future research and clinical work. LDN may represent one of the first glial cell modulators to be used for the management of chronic pain disorders.},

The possible mechanisms of psychostimulants induced neuropathology and neurodegeneration are still not well known. The drugs of abuse results in profound hyperthermia and widespread alterations in neurochemical metabolism in the central nervous system (CNS). It appears that psychostimulants induced hyperthermia and/or release of neurochemicals influence the blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction leading to brain pathology. The drugs of abuse also induce oxidative stress resulting in generation of free radicals and lipid peroxidation. Thus, further research is needed to understand the basic function of BBB disruption and temperature regulation by psychostimulants and to modify them pharmacologically to attenuate brain dysfunction and neuropathology. This review is focused on the problems of morphine and methamphetamine induced hyperthermia and their effects on breakdown of the BBB function leading to brain damage. Work done in our laboratory suggest that hyperthermia caused by these drugs is responsible for BBB disruption and neurodegeneration. This hypothesis is further supported by our observation that pretreatment with a potent antioxidant compound H-290/51 attenuates the BBB disruption and induces marked neuroprotection following morphine induced withdrawal and methamphetamine induced neurotoxicity. The possible mechanisms and functional significance of these findings are discussed.},

	abstract = {The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a highly dynamic interface between the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery. The BBB is comprised of a number of components and is part of the larger neuro(glio)vascular unit. Current literature suggests that psychostimulant drugs of abuse alter the function of the BBB which likely contributes to the neurotoxicities associated with these drugs. In both preclinical and clinical studies, psychostimulants including methamphetamine, MDMA, cocaine, and nicotine, produce BBB dysfunction through alterations in tight junction protein expression and conformation, increased glial activation, increased enzyme activation related to BBB cytoskeleton remodeling, and induction of neuroinflammatory pathways. These detrimental changes lead to increased permeability of the BBB and subsequent vulnerability of the brain to peripheral toxins. In fact, abuse of these psychostimulants, notably methamphetamine and cocaine, has been shown to increase the invasion of peripheral bacteria and viruses into the brain. Much work in this field has focused on the co-morbidity of psychostimulant abuse and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. As psychostimulants alter BBB permeability, it is likely that this BBB dysfunction results in increased penetration of the HIV virus into the brain thus increasing the risk of and severity of neuro AIDS. This review will provide an overview of the specific changes in components within the BBB associated with psychostimulant abuse as well as the implications of these changes in exacerbating the neuropathology associated with psychostimulant drugs and HIV co-morbidity.},

	abstract = {Methylphenidate (MPH) is an amphetamine-like stimulant commonly prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Despite its widespread use, the cellular/molecular effects of MPH remain elusive. Here, we report a novel direct role of MPH on the regulation of macromolecular flux through human brain endothelial cells (ECs). MPH significantly increased caveolae-mediated transcytosis of horseradish peroxidase through ECs without affecting paracellular permeability. Using FRET-based live cell imaging, together with pharmacological inhibitors and lentiviral-mediated shRNA knockdown, we demonstrate that MPH promoted ROS generation via activation of Rac1-dependent NADPH oxidase (NOX) and c-Src activation at the plasma membrane. c-Src in turn was shown to mediate the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (Cav1) on Tyr14 leading to enhanced caveolae formation and transendothelial transport. Accordingly, the inhibition of Cav1 phosphorylation by overexpression of a phosphodefective Cav1Y14F mutant or knocking down Cav1 expression abrogated MPH-induced transcytosis. In addition, both vitamin C and inhibition of NOX blocked MPH-triggered vesicular transport. This study, therefore, identifies Rac1/NOX/c-Src-dependent signaling in MPH-induced increase in transendothelial permeability of brain endothelial cell monolayers via caveolae-mediated transcytosis.},

	abstract = {Csk negatively regulates Src family kinases (SFKs). In lymphocytes, Csk is constitutively active, and is transiently inactivated in response to extracellular stimuli, allowing activation of SFKs. In contrast, both SFKs and Csk were inactive in unstimulated mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and both were activated in response to oxidative stress. Csk modulated the oxidative stress-induced, but not the basal SFK activity in these cells. These data indicate that Csk may be more important for the return of Src-kinases to the basal state than for the maintenance of basal activity in some cell types. Csk must be targeted to its SFK substrates through an SH2-domain-mediated interaction with a phosphoprotein. Our data indicate that caveolin-1 is one of these targeting proteins. SFKs bind to caveolin-1 and phosphorylate it in response to oxidative stress and insulin. Csk binds specifically to the phosphorylated caveolin-1 and attenuates its stress-induced phosphorylation. Importantly, phosphocaveolin was one of two major phosphoproteins associated with Csk after incubation with peroxide or insulin. Paxillin was the other. Activation/rapid attenuation of SFKs by Csk is required for actin remodeling. Caveolin-1 is phosphorylated at the ends of actin fibers at points of contact between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane, where it could in part mediate this attenuation.},

	abstract = {Opiates produce analgesia by activating mu opioid receptor-linked inhibitory G protein signaling cascades and related ion channel interactions that suppress cellular activities by hyperpolarization. After chronic opiate exposure, an excitatory effect emerges contributing to analgesic tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Ultra-low-dose opioid antagonist co-treatment blocks the excitatory effects of opiates in vitro, as well as opioid analgesic tolerance and dependence, as was demonstrated here with ultra-low-dose naloxone combined with morphine. While the molecular mechanism for the excitatory effects of opiates is unclear, a switch in the G protein coupling profile of the mu opioid receptor and adenylyl cyclase activation by Gbetagamma have both been suggested. Using CNS regions from rats chronically treated with vehicle, morphine, morphine+ultra-low-dose naloxone or ultra-low-dose naloxone alone, we examined whether altered mu opioid receptor coupling to G proteins or adenylyl cyclase activation by Gbetagamma occurs after chronic opioid treatment. In morphine-naÃ¯ve rats, mu opioid receptors coupled to Go in striatum and to both Gi and Go in periaqueductal gray and spinal cord. Although chronic morphine decreased Gi/o coupling by mu opioid receptors, a pronounced coupling to Gs emerged coincident with a Gbetagamma interaction with adenylyl cyclase types II and IV. Co-treatment with ultra-low-dose naloxone attenuated both the chronic morphine-induced Gs coupling and the Gbetagamma signaling to adenylyl cyclase, while increasing Gi/o coupling toward or beyond vehicle control levels. These findings provide a molecular mechanism underpinning opioid tolerance and dependence and their attenuation by ultra-low-dose opioid antagonists.},

Here we show that with approximately 200-fold higher affinity than for the mu opioid receptor, naloxone binds a pentapeptide segment of the scaffolding protein filamin A, known to interact with the mu opioid receptor, to disrupt its chronic opioid-induced Gs coupling. Naloxone binding to filamin A is demonstrated by the absence of [3H]-and FITC-naloxone binding in the melanoma M2 cell line that does not contain filamin or MOR, contrasting with strong [3H]naloxone binding to its filamin A-transfected subclone A7 or to immunopurified filamin A. Naloxone binding to A7 cells was displaced by naltrexone but not by morphine, indicating a target distinct from opioid receptors and perhaps unique to naloxone and its analogs. The intracellular location of this binding site was confirmed by FITC-NLX binding in intact A7 cells. Overlapping peptide fragments from c-terminal filamin A revealed filamin A2561-2565 as the binding site, and an alanine scan of this pentapeptide revealed an essential mid-point lysine. Finally, in organotypic striatal slice cultures, peptide fragments containing filamin A2561-2565 abolished the prevention by 10 pM naloxone of both the chronic morphine-induced mu opioid receptor–Gs coupling and the downstream cAMP excitatory signal. These results establish filamin A as the target for ultra-low-dose opioid antagonists previously shown to enhance opioid analgesia and to prevent opioid tolerance and dependence.},

These two signaling changes confer excitatory effects on the cell in place of the typical inhibition by opioids and are associated with morphine tolerance and dependence. Both signaling changes and these behavioral manifestations of chronic morphine are attenuated by cotreatment with ultra-low-dose naloxone. In the present work, using striatum from chronic morphine-treated rats, we isotyped the Gβ within Gs and Go heterotrimers that coupled to MOR and compared these to the Gβ isotype of the Gβγ that interacted with adenylyl cyclase II or IV after chronic morphine treatment. Isotyping results show that chronic morphine causes a Gs heterotrimer associated with MOR to release its Gβγ to interact with adenylyl cyclase. These data suggest that the switch to Gs coupling by MOR in response to chronic morphine, which is attenuated by ultra-low-dose opioid antagonist cotreatment, leads to a two-pronged stimulation of adenylyl cyclase utilizing both Gα and Gβγ subunits of the Gs protein novel to this receptor. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Chronic morphine causes the mu opioid receptor (MOR) to switch its coupling from Gi/o to Gs, resulting in excitatory signaling via both Gαs and its Gβγ dimer. Ultra-low-dose naloxone (NLX) prevents this switch and attenuates opioid tolerance and dependence. This protective effect is mediated via a high-affinity interaction of NLX to a pentapeptide region in c-terminal filamin A (FLNA), a scaffolding protein interacting with MOR. In organotypic striatal slice cultures, we now show that acute morphine induces a dose-dependent Go-to-Gs coupling switch at 5 and 15 min that resolves by 1 hr. The acute Gs coupling induced by 100 µM morphine was completely prevented by co-treatment with 100 pM NLX, (+)NLX, or naltrexone (NTX), or their pentapeptide binding site (FLNA2561–2565), which we show can act as a decoy for MOR or bind to FLNA itself. All of these co-treatments presumably prevent the MOR–FLNA interaction. Since ultra-low-dose NTX also attenuates the addictive properties of opioids, we assessed striatal cAMP production and CREB phosphorylation at S133. Correlating with the Gs coupling, acute morphine induced elevated cAMP levels and a several-fold increase in pS133CREB that were also completely blocked by NLX, NTX or the FLNA pentapeptide. We propose that acute, robust stimulation of MOR causes an interaction with FLNA that allows an initially transient MOR–Gs coupling, which recovers with receptor recycling but persists when MOR stimulation is repeated or prolonged. The complete prevention of this acute, morphine-induced MOR–Gs coupling by 100 pM NLX/NTX or 10 µM pentapeptide segment of FLNA further elucidates both MOR signaling and the mechanism of action of ultra-low-dose NLX or NTX in attenuating opioid tolerance, dependence and addictive potential.},

A review of literature suggesting potential side effects during long treatment with antidepressant drugs was performed. Studies were identified electronically using the following databases: Medline, Cinahl, PsychInfo, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Each database was searched from its inception date to April 2010 using "tolerance", "withdrawal", "sensitization", "antidepressants" and "switching" as key words. Further, a manual search of the psychiatric literature has been performed looking for articles pointing to paradoxical effects of antidepressant medications. Clinical evidence has been found indicating that even though antidepressant drugs are effective in treating depressive episodes, they are less efficacious in recurrent depression and in preventing relapse. In some cases, antidepressants have been described inducing adverse events such as withdrawal symptoms at discontinuation, onset of tolerance and resistance phenomena and switch and cycle acceleration in bipolar patients. Unfavorable long-term outcomes and paradoxical effects (depression inducing and symptomatic worsening) have also been reported. All these phenomena may be explained on the basis of the oppositional model of tolerance. Continued drug treatment may recruit processes that oppose the initial acute effect of a drug. When drug treatment ends, these processes may operate unopposed, at least for some time and increase vulnerability to relapse. Antidepressant drugs are crucial in the treatment of major depressive episodes. However, appraisal and testing of the oppositional model of tolerance may yield important insights as to long-term treatment and achievement of enduring effects.},

	abstract = {Antidepressant medications are the first-line treatment for people meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. Most antidepressants are designed to perturb the neurotransmitter serotonin—an evolutionarily ancient biochemical found in plants, animals and fungi. Many adaptive processes evolved to be regulated by serotonin, including emotion, development, neuronal growth and death, platelet activation and the clotting process, attention, electrolyte balance, and reproduction. It is a principle of evolutionary medicine that the disruption of evolved adaptations will degrade biological functioning. Because serotonin regulates many adaptive processes, antidepressants could have many adverse health effects. For instance, while antidepressants are modestly effective in reducing depressive symptoms, they increase the brain’s susceptibility to future episodes after they have been discontinued. Contrary to a widely held belief in psychiatry, studies that purport to show that antidepressants promote neurogenesis are flawed because they all use a method that cannot, by itself, distinguish between neurogenesis and neuronal death. In fact, antidepressants cause neuronal damage and mature neurons to revert to an immature state, both of which may explain why antidepressants also cause neurons to undergo apoptosis (programmed death).

	abstract = {Frodl T, Skokauskas N. Meta-analysis of structural MRI studies in children and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder indicates treatment effects. Objective: About 50–80\% of ADHD cases have been found to persist into adulthood, but ADHD symptoms change with age. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of MRI voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and manual tracing studies to identify the differences between adults and children with ADHD as well as between treated and untreated individuals. Method: Several databases were searched using keywords ‘attention-deficit and MRI’, ‘ADHD and MRI’. Gray matter volumes from VBM studies and caudate volumes from tracing studies of patients and controls were analyzed using signed differential mapping. Results: Meta-analyses detected reduced right globus pallidus and putamen volumes in VBM studies as well as decreased caudate volumes in manual tracing studies in children with ADHD. Adult patients with ADHD showed volume reduction in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). A higher percentage of treated participants were associated with less changes. Conclusion: Basal ganglia regions like the right globus pallidus, the right putamen, and the nucleus caudatus are structurally affected in children with ADHD. These changes and alterations in limbic regions like ACC and amygdala are more pronounced in non-treated populations and seem to diminish over time from child to adulthood. Treatment seems to have positive effects on brain structure.},

To evaluate the impact of therapeutic oral doses of stimulants on the brains of ADHD subjects as measured by MRI-based neuroimaging studies (morphometric, functional, spectroscopy).

Data Sources
We searched PubMed and ScienceDirect through the end of calendar year 2011 using the keywords: 1) “psychostimulants” or “methylphenidate” or “amphetamine”, and 2) “neuroimaging” or “MRI” or “fMRI”, and 3) “ADHD” or “ADD” or “Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder” or “Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder”.

Study Selection
We included only English language articles with new data that were case or placebo-controlled and examined ADHD subjects on and off psychostimulants (as well as 5 relevant review papers).

Data Extraction
We combined details of study design and medication effects in each imaging modality.

Results
We found 29 published studies that met our criteria. These included 6 structural MRI, 20 functional MRI studies and 3 spectroscopy studies. Methods varied widely in terms of design, analytic technique, and regions of the brain investigated. Despite heterogeneity in methods, however, results were consistent. With only a few exceptions, the data on the effect of therapeutic oral doses of stimulant medication suggest attenuation of structural and functional alterations found in unmedicated ADHD subjects relative to findings in Controls.

Conclusions
Despite the inherent limitations and heterogeneity of the extant MRI literature, our review suggests that therapeutic oral doses of stimulants decrease alterations in brain structure and function in subjects with ADHD relative to unmedicated subjects and Controls. These medication-associated brain effects parallel, and may underlie, the well-established clinical benefits.},

	abstract = {Antidepressant medications are the first-line treatment for people meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. Most antidepressants are designed to perturb the neurotransmitter serotonin—an evolutionarily ancient biochemical found in plants, animals and fungi. Many adaptive processes evolved to be regulated by serotonin, including emotion, development, neuronal growth and death, platelet activation and the clotting process, attention, electrolyte balance, and reproduction. It is a principle of evolutionary medicine that the disruption of evolved adaptations will degrade biological functioning. Because serotonin regulates many adaptive processes, antidepressants could have many adverse health effects. For instance, while antidepressants are modestly effective in reducing depressive symptoms, they increase the brain’s susceptibility to future episodes after they have been discontinued. Contrary to a widely held belief in psychiatry, studies that purport to show that antidepressants promote neurogenesis are flawed because they all use a method that cannot, by itself, distinguish between neurogenesis and neuronal death. In fact, antidepressants cause neuronal damage and mature neurons to revert to an immature state, both of which may explain why antidepressants also cause neurons to undergo apoptosis (programmed death). Antidepressants can also cause developmental problems, they have adverse effects on sexual and romantic life, and they increase the risk of hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood plasma), bleeding, stroke, and death in the elderly. Our review supports the conclusion that antidepressants generally do more harm than good by disrupting a number of adaptive processes regulated by serotonin. However, there may be specific conditions for which their use is warranted (e.g., cancer, recovery from stroke).

Cognitive function was assessed using five cognitive tests (immediate free recall test, delayed free recall test, recognition test, Digit Symbol Substitution Subtest and visual search speed test). Cognitive scores obtained after a 10-year follow-up were investigated among three categories of benzodiazepine users, namely, non-users, occasional users and long-term users, using analysis of covariance models adjusted for several potential confounders in men and women separately.ResultsIn the course of the 10 year-follow-up, 3.9\% of subjects were defined as occasional users of benzodiazepine and 7.5\% as long-term users. The analysis revealed a significant alteration of long-term memory in women whereas there was no significant association in men.ConclusionsLong-term use of benzodiazepine leads to specific impairment in long-term memory only in women.},

However, these drugs have significant side effects, such as respiratory suppression, constipation, allodynia, tolerance, and dependence, as well as abuse potential. Efforts to fine tune pain control while alleviating the side effects of drugs, both physiological and psychological, have led to the development of a wide variety of structurally diverse agonist ligands for the μ-opioid receptor, as well as compounds that target κ- and δ-opioid receptors. In recent years, the identification of allosteric ligands for some G protein-coupled receptors has provided breakthroughs in obtaining receptor subtype-selectivity that can reduce the overall side effect profiles of a potential drug. However, positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) can also have the specific advantage of only modulating the activity of the receptor when the orthosteric agonist occupies the receptor, thus maintaining spatial and temporal control of receptor signaling in vivo. This second advantage of allosteric modulators may yield breakthroughs in opioid receptor research and could lead to drugs with improved side-effect profiles or fewer tolerance and dependence issues compared with orthosteric opioid receptor agonists. Here, we describe the discovery and characterization of μ-opioid receptor PAMs and silent allosteric modulators, identified from high-throughput screening using a β-arrestin–recruitment assay.},

However, the impact of neurotrophic signaling on glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent gene expression is not understood. We therefore examined the impact of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling on GR transcriptional regulatory function by gene expression profiling in primary rat cortical neurons stimulated with the selective GR agonist dexamethasone (Dex) and BDNF, alone or in combination. Simultaneous treatment with BDNF and Dex elicited a unique set of GR-responsive genes associated with neuronal growth and differentiation and also enhanced the induction of a large number of Dex-sensitive genes. BDNF via its receptor TrkB enhanced the transcriptional activity of a synthetic GR reporter, suggesting a direct effect of BDNF signaling on GR function. Indeed, BDNF treatment induces the phosphorylation of GR at serine 155 (S155) and serine 287 (S287). Expression of a nonphosphorylatable mutant (GR S155A/S287A) impaired the induction of a subset of BDNF- and Dex-regulated genes. Mechanistically, BDNF-induced GR phosphorylation increased GR occupancy and cofactor recruitment at the promoter of a BDNF-enhanced gene. GR phosphorylation in vivo is sensitive to changes in the levels of BDNF and TrkB as well as stress. Therefore, BDNF signaling specifies and amplifies the GR transcriptome through a coordinated GR phosphorylation-dependent detection mechanism.},

Here we report that GCs can selectively activate Trk receptor tyrosine kinases after in vivo administration in the brain and in cultures of hippocampal and cortical neurons. Trk receptors are normally activated by neurotrophins, such as NGF and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, but the activation of Trk receptors by GCs does not depend on increased production of neurotrophins. Other tyrosine kinase receptors, such as EGF and FGF receptors, were not activated by GCs. The ability of GCs to increase Trk receptor activity resulted in the neuroprotection of neurons deprived of trophic support and could be modulated by steroid-converting enzymes. Pharmacological and shRNA experiments indicate that Trk receptor activation by GCs depends on a genomic action of the GC receptor. The ability of GCs to promote Trk receptor activity represents a molecular mechanism that integrates the actions of GCs and neurotrophins.},

	abstract = {Stress-related disorders are prevalent worldwide, but the pathophysiology of these disorders and specific therapeutic targets remain elusive. Two hypothetical frameworks show great promise: decreased neurotrophic support and decreased responsiveness to glucocorticoids. Our study shows that the glucocorticoid receptor is a prominent target of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, which gives rise to unique functional attributes essential for the neuroplasticity to an antidepressant. We propose a unifying mechanism of BDNF-priming of glucocorticoid signaling, which provides new prospects for discovering innovative treatments for disorders featuring unpaired BDNF and glucocorticoid activities. Eliciting glucocorticoid receptor phosphorylation is an attractive means to confront resistance to antidepressants., Neurotrophins and glucocorticoids are robust synaptic modifiers, and deregulation of their activities is a risk factor for developing stress-related disorders. Low levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) increase the desensitization of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and vulnerability to stress, whereas higher levels of BDNF facilitate GR-mediated signaling and the response to antidepressants. However, the molecular mechanism underlying neurotrophic-priming of GR function is poorly understood. Here we provide evidence that activation of a TrkB-MAPK pathway, when paired with the deactivation of a GR-protein phosphatase 5 pathway, resulted in sustained GR phosphorylation at BDNF-sensitive sites that is essential for the transcription of neuronal plasticity genes. Genetic strategies that disrupted GR phosphorylation or TrkB signaling in vivo impaired the neuroplasticity to chronic stress and the effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine. Our findings reveal that the coordinated actions of BDNF and glucocorticoids promote neuronal plasticity and that disruption in either pathway could set the stage for the development of stress-induced psychiatric diseases.},

	abstract = {The interaction between neurotrophins and glucocorticoids has been at the center of studies of neuroplasticity in stress-related disorders for several decades (1). The report in PNAS by Arango-Lievano et al. (2) shows that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) facilitates glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated signaling and enables glucocorticoids, primed by BDNF, to activate gene transcription and possibly other cellular actions mediated by the GR. As a first step, according to Arango-Lievano et al., glucocorticoids allow the detachment of the protein phosphatase, PP5, from GR complexes, permitting increased GR phosphorylation by MAP kinases. Then, the coincidence of BDNF and glucocorticoids is necessary to activate genomic GR responses because GR is not translocated into the nucleus of neurons stimulated only with BDNF, without the glucocorticoid being present.

The Arango-Lievano et al. (2) paper “closes a loop” that was begun by a previous study by Jeanneteau, Garabedian, and Chao (3), showing that glucocorticoids can selectively activate tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) after in vivo administration in the brain and in cultures of hippocampal and cortical neurons. This activation did not require increased production of BDNF and was dependent on the genomic action of the GR. Thus, there is a positive feedback loop in which glucocorticoids and BDNF synergistically potentiate each other’s concurrent actions, and Arango-Lievano et al. (2) suggest that failure of this loop underlies loss of plasticity and resilience in mood-related disorders, and possibly also the lack of response to antidepressant medications (Fig. 1). Taken together with other recent work on hormone action, this paper illustrates a number of important emerging themes concerning …

	abstract = {Exosomes are membrane-bound nanovesicles that are shed by cells of various lineages under normal as well as pathological conditions. Previously thought to be ‘extracellular debris’, exosomes have recently generated immense interest following their discovery as mediators of intercellular communication by delivering functional proteins, mRNA transcripts as well as miRNAs to recipient cells. Although suggested to primarily serve as signaling organelles which also remove unwanted cellular components in the brain, accumulating evidence suggests that exosomes can also significantly contribute to the development of several neuropathologies. Toxic forms of aggregated proteins such as α-synuclein, amyloid β and prions, that are responsible for the development of Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) respectively, have been shown to get effectively packaged into exosomes and spread from one cell to another, initiating an inflammatory cascade. In addition, exosomes secreted by resident brain cells in response to pathogenic stimuli such as viral proteins can also influence bystander cells by the transfer of dysregulated miRNAs that suppress the expression of essential genes in the recipient cells. Given the relevance of exosomes in brain communication and neuropathogenesis, novel therapeutic strategies are now being developed that exploit the biology of these vesicles to deliver anti-inflammatory molecules to the CNS. Exosomes may alter the way we think about brain disorders and their treatments.},

The discovery of drug molecules capable of targeting multiple factors involved in AD pathogenesis would greatly facilitate in improving therapeutic strategies. The repositioning of existing non-toxic drugs could dramatically reduce the time and costs involved in developmental and clinical trial stages. In this study, preliminary screening of 140 FDA approved nervous system drugs by docking suggested the viability of the tricyclic group of antidepressants against three major AD targets, viz. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), β-secretase (BACE-1), and amyloid β (Aβ) aggregation, with one member, protriptyline, showing highest inhibitory activity. Detailed biophysical assays, together with isothermal calorimetry, fluorescence quenching experiments, kinetic studies and atomic force microscopy established the strong inhibitory activity of protriptyline against all three major targets. The molecular basis of inhibition was supported with comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations. Further, the drug inhibited glycation induced amyloid aggregation, another important causal factor in AD progression. This study has led to the discovery of protriptyline as a potent multi target directed ligand and established its viability as a promising candidate for AD treatment.},

We studied the effects of protriptyline on human ether-à-go-go-related gene (HERG) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells. Protriptyline induced a concentration-dependent decrease in current amplitudes at the end of the voltage steps and HERG tail currents. The IC(50) for protriptyline block of HERG current in Xenopus oocytes progressively decreased relative to the degree of depolarization, from 142.0 microM at -40 mV to 91.7 microM at 0 mV to 52.9 microM at +40 mV. The voltage dependence of the block could be fit with a monoexponential function, and the fractional electrical distance was estimated to be delta=0.93. The IC(50) for the protriptyline-induced blockade of HERG currents in HEK293 cells at 36 degrees C was 1.18 microM at +20 mV. Protriptyline affected channels in the activated and inactivated states, but not in the closed states. HERG blockade by protriptyline was use-dependent, exhibiting a more rapid onset and a greater steady-state block at higher frequencies of activation. Our findings suggest that inhibition of HERG currents may contribute to the arrhythmogenic side effects of protriptyline.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, increasing public and political pressure has supported legalization of medical marijuana. One of the main thrusts in this effort has related to the treatment of refractory epilepsy—especially in children with Dravet syndrome—using cannabidiol (CBD). Despite initiatives in numerous states to at least legalize possession of CBD oil for treating epilepsy, little published evidence is available to prove or disprove the efficacy and safety of CBD in patients with epilepsy. This review highlights some of the basic science theory behind the use of CBD, summarizes published data on clinical use of CBD for epilepsy, and highlights issues related to the use of currently available CBD products., Cannabidiol is the major nonpsychoactive component of Cannabis sativa. Over the centuries, a number of medicinal preparations derived from C. sativa have been employed for a variety of disorders, including gout, rheumatism, malaria, pain, and fever. These preparations were widely employed as analgesics by Western medical practitioners in the 19th century (). More recently, there is clinical evidence suggesting efficacy in HIV-associated neuropathic pain, as well as spasms associated with multiple sclerosis ().},

	abstract = {Δ(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol (CBD), and cannabinol are the three major cannabinoids contained in marijuana, which are devoid of nitrogen atoms in their structures. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of the major phytocannabinoids on the catalytic activity of human CYP2D6. These major cannabinoids inhibited the 3-[2-(N,N-diethyl-N-methylammonium)ethyl]-7-methoxy-4-methylcoumarin (AMMC) and dextromethorphan O-demethylase activities of recombinant CYP2D6 and pooled human liver microsomes in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50) = 4.01-24.9 μM), indicating the strongest inhibitory potency of CBD. However, these cannabinoids showed no or weak metabolism-dependent inhibition. CBD competitively inhibited the CYP2D6 activities with the apparent K(i) values of 1.16 to 2.69 μM. To clarify the structural requirement for CBD-mediated CYP2D6 inhibition, effects of CBD-related compounds on the AMMC O-demethylase activity of recombinant CYP2D6 were examined. Olivetol (IC(50) = 7.21 μM) inhibited CYP2D6 activity as potently as CBD did (IC(50) = 6.52 μM), whereas d-limonene did not show any inhibitory effect. Pentylbenzene failed to inhibit CYP2D6 activity. Furthermore, neither monomethyl nor dimethyl ethers of CBD inhibited the activity. Cannabidivarin having a propyl side chain inhibited CYP2D6 activity; its inhibitory effect (IC(50) = 10.2 μM) was less potent than that of CBD. On the other hand, orcinol and resorcinol showed lack of inhibition. The inhibitory effect of CBD on CYP2D6 activity was more potent than those of 16 compounds without nitrogen atoms tested, such as progesterone. These results indicated that CBD caused potent direct CYP2D6 inhibition, in which two phenolic hydroxyl groups and the pentyl side chain of CBD may play important roles.},

Serum T was assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure. Analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, non-parametrical tests, and generalized linear regression models were performed to examine group differences. The atypical depressive subtype showed significantly lower T levels compared with the melancholic depressives. While accumulative evidence indicates that, beyond psychosocial characteristics, the melancholic and atypical depressive subtypes are also distinguishable by biological correlates, the current study expanded this knowledge to include gonadal hormones.

Binding parameters, i.e. KD-values and binding site concentrations, for the interaction of human and bovine beta-casomorphins with opioid receptors in rat brain homogenates were determined in inhibition experiments, using [3H]-(D-Ala2, MePhe4, Gly-ol5)enkephalin, [3H]-(D-Ala2, D-Leu5)enkephalin and [3H]ethylketazocin as mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptor ligands. Analysis of binding data was performed using a non-linear curve fitting program. All beta-casomorphins examined displayed opioid activity. The affinity was highest for mu-receptors, less so for delta-receptors and lowest for kappa-receptors. It is suggested that human beta-casomorphins might play a role as "food hormones".},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence-based medicine is valuable to the extent that the evidence base is complete and unbiased. Selective publication of clinical trials--and the outcomes within those trials--can lead to unrealistic estimates of drug effectiveness and alter the apparent risk-benefit ratio.
METHODS: We obtained reviews from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for studies of 12 antidepressant agents involving 12,564 patients. We conducted a systematic literature search to identify matching publications. For trials that were reported in the literature, we compared the published outcomes with the FDA outcomes. We also compared the effect size derived from the published reports with the effect size derived from the entire FDA data set.
RESULTS: Among 74 FDA-registered studies, 31\%, accounting for 3449 study participants, were not published. Whether and how the studies were published were associated with the study outcome. A total of 37 studies viewed by the FDA as having positive results were published; 1 study viewed as positive was not published. Studies viewed by the FDA as having negative or questionable results were, with 3 exceptions, either not published (22 studies) or published in a way that, in our opinion, conveyed a positive outcome (11 studies). According to the published literature, it appeared that 94\% of the trials conducted were positive. By contrast, the FDA analysis showed that 51\% were positive. Separate meta-analyses of the FDA and journal data sets showed that the increase in effect size ranged from 11 to 69\% for individual drugs and was 32\% overall.
CONCLUSIONS: We cannot determine whether the bias observed resulted from a failure to submit manuscripts on the part of authors and sponsors, from decisions by journal editors and reviewers not to publish, or both. Selective reporting of clinical trial results may have adverse consequences for researchers, study participants, health care professionals, and patients.},

some have no effect at all on serotonin. Nevertheless, they all show the same
therapeutic benefit. Even the small statistical difference between
antidepressants and placebos may be an enhanced placebo effect, due to the fact
that most patients and doctors in clinical trials successfully break blind. The

Here, we demonstrate that incubation (2 h) of murine islets or Min6 β cell line with the SSRIs paroxetine, fluoxetine, or sertraline inhibited insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 protein and the activation of its downstream targets Akt and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1). Inhibition was dose-dependent with half-maximal effects at ∼15–20 μm. It correlated with a rapid dephosphorylation and activation of the IRS kinase GSK3β. Introduction of GSK3β siRNAs eliminated the inhibitory effects of the SSRIs. Inhibition of IRS-2 action by 30 μm SSRI was associated with a marked inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from murine and human pancreatic islets. Secretion induced by basic secretagogues (KCl and Arg) was not affected by these drugs. Prolonged treatment (16 h) of Min6 cells with sertraline resulted in the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase; activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and the initiation of the unfolded protein response, manifested by enhanced transcription of ATF4 and C/EBP homologous protein. This triggered an apoptotic process, manifested by enhanced caspase 3/7 activity, which resulted in β cell death. These findings implicate SSRIs as inhibitors of IRS protein function and insulin action through the activation of GSK3β. They further suggest that SSRIs inhibit insulin secretion; induce the unfolded protein response; activate an apoptotic process, and trigger β cell death. Given that SSRIs promote insulin resistance while inhibiting insulin secretion, these drugs might accelerate the transition from an insulin-resistant state to overt diabetes.},

	abstract = {Antidepressant medications are the first-line treatment for people meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. Most antidepressants are designed to perturb the neurotransmitter serotonin—an evolutionarily ancient biochemical found in plants, animals and fungi. Many adaptive processes evolved to be regulated by serotonin, including emotion, development, neuronal growth and death, platelet activation and the clotting process, attention, electrolyte balance, and reproduction. It is a principle of evolutionary medicine that the disruption of evolved adaptations will degrade biological functioning. Because serotonin regulates many adaptive processes, antidepressants could have many adverse health effects. For instance, while antidepressants are modestly effective in reducing depressive symptoms, they increase the brain’s susceptibility to future episodes after they have been discontinued. Contrary to a widely held belief in psychiatry, studies that purport to show that antidepressants promote neurogenesis are flawed because they all use a method that cannot, by itself, distinguish between neurogenesis and neuronal death. In fact, antidepressants cause neuronal damage and mature neurons to revert to an immature state, both of which may explain why antidepressants also cause neurons to undergo apoptosis (programmed death). Antidepressants can also cause developmental problems, they have adverse effects on sexual and romantic life, and they increase the risk of hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood plasma), bleeding, stroke, and death in the elderly. Our review supports the conclusion that antidepressants generally do more harm than good by disrupting a number of adaptive processes regulated by serotonin. However, there may be specific conditions for which their use is warranted (e.g., cancer, recovery from stroke). We conclude that altered informed consent practices and greater caution in the prescription of antidepressants are warranted.},

METHOD: Twenty-seven patients with remitted major depressive disorder and 20 healthy subjects underwent tryptophan depletion and sham depletion in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. Serum BDNF concentrations and plasma tryptophan concentrations as well as behavioral assessments were obtained.
RESULTS: During tryptophan depletion, BDNF levels increased in healthy volunteers. By contrast, patients with remitted major depressive disorder were unable to mount this presumed compensatory response, and BDNF levels remained low in these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The results further substantiate the potential role of BDNF in major depressive disorder.},

Schizophrenics in the United States currently fare worse than patients in the world’s poorest countries. Medical journalist Robert Whitaker argues that modern treatments for the severely mentally ill are just old medicine in new bottles, and that we as a society are deeply deluded about their efficacy. The widespread use of lobotomies in the 1920's and 1930's gave way in the 1950's to electroshock and a wave of new drugs. In what is perhaps Robert Whitaker’s most damning revelation, he examines how drug companies in the 1980's and 1990's skewed their studies to prove that new anti-psychotic drugs were more effective than the old, while keeping patients in the dark about dangerous side effects.

Robert Whitaker raises important questions about our obligations to the mad, the meaning of “insanity,” and what we value most about the human mind.

In general, it is assumed that antidepressants are beneficial for all symptoms of depression, including suicidality. However, some evidence suggests that Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors [SSRIs] may cause worsening of suicidal ideas in vulnerable patients. Systematic reviews and pooled analysis of experimental, observational, and epidemiological studies have investigated the use of SSRIs and their association with suicidality. Taking account of the methodological limitations of these studies, the current evidence fails to provide a clear relationship between their use and risk of suicidality in adults. However, in children and adolescents, there appears to be a bit of increased risk of suicidal ideations and attempts, but not of completed suicides. This risk can be anticipated and managed clinically. Clinicians are, therefore, advised to maintain a close follow-up during the initial treatment periods and remain vigilant of this risk. This advisory, however, should not deter clinicians from the use of effective dosages of antidepressants for a sufficient period of time, in every age group of patients, when clinically needed, and if found suitable otherwise.},

Here, we demonstrate that incubation (2 h) of murine islets or Min6 β cell line with the SSRIs paroxetine, fluoxetine, or sertraline inhibited insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 protein and the activation of its downstream targets Akt and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1). Inhibition was dose-dependent with half-maximal effects at ∼15–20 μm. It correlated with a rapid dephosphorylation and activation of the IRS kinase GSK3β. Introduction of GSK3β siRNAs eliminated the inhibitory effects of the SSRIs. Inhibition of IRS-2 action by 30 μm SSRI was associated with a marked inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from murine and human pancreatic islets. Secretion induced by basic secretagogues (KCl and Arg) was not affected by these drugs. Prolonged treatment (16 h) of Min6 cells with sertraline resulted in the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase; activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and the initiation of the unfolded protein response, manifested by enhanced transcription of ATF4 and C/EBP homologous protein. This triggered an apoptotic process, manifested by enhanced caspase 3/7 activity, which resulted in β cell death. These findings implicate SSRIs as inhibitors of IRS protein function and insulin action through the activation of GSK3β. They further suggest that SSRIs inhibit insulin secretion; induce the unfolded protein response; activate an apoptotic process, and trigger β cell death. Given that SSRIs promote insulin resistance while inhibiting insulin secretion, these drugs might accelerate the transition from an insulin-resistant state to overt diabetes.},

	abstract = {Background
For women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive early breast cancer, treatment with tamoxifen for 5 years substantially reduces the breast cancer mortality rate throughout the first 15 years after diagnosis. We aimed to assess the further effects of continuing tamoxifen to 10 years instead of stopping at 5 years.

Methods
In the worldwide Adjuvant Tamoxifen: Longer Against Shorter (ATLAS) trial, 12 894 women with early breast cancer who had completed 5 years of treatment with tamoxifen were randomly allocated to continue tamoxifen to 10 years or stop at 5 years (open control). Allocation (1:1) was by central computer, using minimisation. After entry (between 1996 and 2005), yearly follow-up forms recorded any recurrence, second cancer, hospital admission, or death. We report effects on breast cancer outcomes among the 6846 women with ER-positive disease, and side-effects among all women (with positive, negative, or unknown ER status). Long-term follow-up still continues. This study is registered, number ISRCTN19652633.

Findings
Among women with ER-positive disease, allocation to continue tamoxifen reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence (617 recurrences in 3428 women allocated to continue vs 711 in 3418 controls, p=0·002), reduced breast cancer mortality (331 deaths vs 397 deaths, p=0·01), and reduced overall mortality (639 deaths vs 722 deaths, p=0·01). The reductions in adverse breast cancer outcomes appeared to be less extreme before than after year 10 (recurrence rate ratio [RR] 0·90 [95\% CI 0·79–1·02] during years 5–9 and 0·75 [0·62–0·90] in later years; breast cancer mortality RR 0·97 [0·79–1·18] during years 5–9 and 0·71 [0·58–0·88] in later years). The cumulative risk of recurrence during years 5–14 was 21·4\% for women allocated to continue versus 25·1\% for controls; breast cancer mortality during years 5–14 was 12·2\% for women allocated to continue versus 15·0\% for controls (absolute mortality reduction 2·8\%). Treatment allocation seemed to have no effect on breast cancer outcome among 1248 women with ER-negative disease, and an intermediate effect among 4800 women with unknown ER status. Among all 12 894 women, mortality without recurrence from causes other than breast cancer was little affected (691 deaths without recurrence in 6454 women allocated to continue versus 679 deaths in 6440 controls; RR 0·99 [0·89–1·10]; p=0·84). For the incidence (hospitalisation or death) rates of specific diseases, RRs were as follows: pulmonary embolus 1·87 (95\% CI 1·13–3·07, p=0·01 [including 0·2\% mortality in both treatment groups]), stroke 1·06 (0·83–1·36), ischaemic heart disease 0·76 (0·60–0·95, p=0·02), and endometrial cancer 1·74 (1·30–2·34, p=0·0002). The cumulative risk of endometrial cancer during years 5–14 was 3·1\% (mortality 0·4\%) for women allocated to continue versus 1·6\% (mortality 0·2\%) for controls (absolute mortality increase 0·2\%).

Interpretation
For women with ER-positive disease, continuing tamoxifen to 10 years rather than stopping at 5 years produces a further reduction in recurrence and mortality, particularly after year 10. These results, taken together with results from previous trials of 5 years of tamoxifen treatment versus none, suggest that 10 years of tamoxifen treatment can approximately halve breast cancer mortality during the second decade after diagnosis.

	abstract = {This pragmatic randomized controlled trial tested the effectiveness of long-term psychoanalytic psychotherapy (LTPP) as an adjunct to treatment-as-usual according to UK national guidelines (TAU), compared to TAU alone, in patients with long-standing major depression who had failed at least two different treatments and were considered to have treatment-resistant depression. Patients (N=129) were recruited from primary care and randomly allocated to the two treatment conditions. They were assessed at 6-monthly intervals during the 18 months of treatment and at 24, 30 and 42 months during follow-up. The primary outcome measure was the 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), with complete remission defined as a HDRS-17 score ≤8, and partial remission defined as a HDRS-17 score ≤12. Secondary outcome measures included self-reported depression as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory - II, social functioning as evaluated by the Global Assessment of Functioning, subjective wellbeing as rated by the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure, and satisfaction with general activities as assessed by the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. Complete remission was infrequent in both groups at the end of treatment (9.4\% in the LTPP group vs. 6.5\% in the control group) as well as at 42-month follow-up (14.9\% vs. 4.4\%). Partial remission was not significantly more likely in the LTPP than in the control group at the end of treatment (32.1\% vs. 23.9\%, p=0.37), but significant differences emerged during follow-up (24 months: 38.8\% vs. 19.2\%, p=0.03; 30 months: 34.7\% vs. 12.2\%, p=0.008; 42 months: 30.0\% vs. 4.4\%, p=0.001). Both observer-based and self-reported depression scores showed steeper declines in the LTPP group, alongside greater improvements on measures of social adjustment. These data suggest that LTPP can be useful in improving the long-term outcome of treatment-resistant depression. End-of-treatment evaluations or short follow-ups may miss the emergence of delayed therapeutic benefit.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of tranylcypromine and combination treatment with extended-release venlafaxine and mirtazapine in patients with treatment-resistant major depression whose current depressive episode had not responded adequately to treatment in three prior prospective medication trials.
METHOD: Adult outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder who had not achieved remission or had withdrawn from treatment because of intolerance in three previous prospective medication trials were randomly assigned to receive open-label treatment with either tranylcypromine (N=58) or extended-release venlafaxine plus mirtazapine (N=51). The primary outcome measure was whether patients achieved remission, which was defined as a score {\textless} or =7 at exit on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). The HAM-D was administered by telephone by raters to whom treatment was masked.
RESULTS: Remission rates were not significantly different between the two treatment groups (6.9\% for the tranylcypromine group and 13.7\% for the venlafaxine plus mirtazapine group). The mean daily dose at exit for tranylcypromine was 36.9 mg (SD=18.5); for venlafaxine, 210.3 mg (SD=95.2); and for mirtazapine, 35.7 mg (SD=17.6). Tranylcypromine was associated with significantly less symptom reduction and greater attrition due to intolerance.
CONCLUSIONS: Remission rates were modest for both the tranylcypromine group and the extended-release venlafaxine plus mirtazapine group, and the rates were not statistically different between groups. The lower side effect burden, lack of dietary restrictions, and ease of use of venlafaxine and mirtazapine suggest that this combination may be preferred over tranylcypromine for patients with highly treatment-resistant depression who have not benefited adequately from several prior treatments.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Although a growing selection of antidepressants is available, a significant number of patients do not reach clinical remission, despite multiple trials. Data concerning the efficacy and safety of combination therapies with newer antidepressants are limited.

Methods
Fifteen inpatients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), defined as Beck Depression Inventory-2 (BDI-2) scores {\textgreater}14 despite treatment with adequate doses of ≥1 antidepressant classes for ≥6 weeks, were treated with agomelatine plus bupropion for ≥6 weeks, and compared to 15 patients on antidepressant monotherapy with TRD matched on age, sex, and TRD stage based on retrospective chart review. The primary outcome was change in BDI-2 scores. Secondary outcomes included treatment response (BDI-2 score decrease by ≥50\%), remission (BDI-2 score {\textless}13), routinely measured cardiometabolic parameters and adverse effects.

Results
After a mean of 6 ± 1 weeks, BDI-2 scores decreased by 20.3 ± 5.6 points in the combination group compared to 12.5 ± 15.1 points in the monotherapy group (P = 0.073; Cohen's d = 0.7). Altogether, 73.3\% in the combination group responded compared to 53.3\% on monotherapy (P = 0.27). About 60.0\% on combination therapy reached remission compared to 40\% on monotherapy (P = 0.28), a difference equivalent to a number-needed-to-treat = 4. Treatment response was independent of the degree of TRD (P = 0.27). Bupropion-agomelatine cotreatment was well tolerated and laboratory adverse effect parameters were not altered.

Conclusion
Despite the small sample and uncontrolled study design, the good remission rate in TRD patients receiving agomelatine plus bupropion, particularly in comparison to the monotherapy group, indicates that this combination treatment should be explored further as a potentially promising strategy for patients with TRD.},

l-Methylfolate has been shown in retrospective and prospective studies to enhance antidepressant response. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess change in depression severity and medication satisfaction in patients prescribed l-methylfolate within a naturalistic setting., Method: Between November 2010 and April 2012, patients who reported being treated for major depressive disorder rated their experiences before and after 3 months on the prescription medical food l-methylfolate (Deplin) 7.5 mg or 15 mg, through an automated telephone system. Survey questions included the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), as well as quality of life and medication satisfaction questions. The primary outcome was change in depression severity from baseline to endpoint., Results: Of 554 patients, 502 reported that l-methylfolate was added to their existing antidepressant and 52 were treated with l-methylfolate alone, without an antidepressant. Enrolled participants reported a mean reduction of 8.5 points (58.2\% decrease) in their PHQ-9 score (mean baseline PHQ-9 score = 14.6, mean follow-up PHQ-9 score = 6.1; P = .000); 376 (67.9\%) responded to treatment (50\% reduction in baseline PHQ-9 score) and 253 (45.7\%) achieved remission (follow-up PHQ-9 score {\textless} 5) after an average of 95 days of therapy. In addition, patients achieved significant reductions in self-reported impairment in their work/home/social life (P = .000). Medication satisfaction with l-methylfolate (mean satisfaction score = 7.0) was significantly higher than with prior medication (mean satisfaction score = 5.2; P = .000)., Conclusions: Results show that in a naturalistic setting, patients managed with l-methylfolate achieved statistically significant improvements in self-reported depression symptoms and functioning and greater satisfaction with their medication treatment.},

	abstract = {Background
For women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive early breast cancer, treatment with tamoxifen for 5 years substantially reduces the breast cancer mortality rate throughout the first 15 years after diagnosis. We aimed to assess the further effects of continuing tamoxifen to 10 years instead of stopping at 5 years.

Methods
In the worldwide Adjuvant Tamoxifen: Longer Against Shorter (ATLAS) trial, 12 894 women with early breast cancer who had completed 5 years of treatment with tamoxifen were randomly allocated to continue tamoxifen to 10 years or stop at 5 years (open control). Allocation (1:1) was by central computer, using minimisation. After entry (between 1996 and 2005), yearly follow-up forms recorded any recurrence, second cancer, hospital admission, or death. We report effects on breast cancer outcomes among the 6846 women with ER-positive disease, and side-effects among all women (with positive, negative, or unknown ER status). Long-term follow-up still continues. This study is registered, number ISRCTN19652633.

Findings
Among women with ER-positive disease, allocation to continue tamoxifen reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence (617 recurrences in 3428 women allocated to continue vs 711 in 3418 controls, p=0·002), reduced breast cancer mortality (331 deaths vs 397 deaths, p=0·01), and reduced overall mortality (639 deaths vs 722 deaths, p=0·01). The reductions in adverse breast cancer outcomes appeared to be less extreme before than after year 10 (recurrence rate ratio [RR] 0·90 [95\% CI 0·79–1·02] during years 5–9 and 0·75 [0·62–0·90] in later years; breast cancer mortality RR 0·97 [0·79–1·18] during years 5–9 and 0·71 [0·58–0·88] in later years). The cumulative risk of recurrence during years 5–14 was 21·4\% for women allocated to continue versus 25·1\% for controls; breast cancer mortality during years 5–14 was 12·2\% for women allocated to continue versus 15·0\% for controls (absolute mortality reduction 2·8\%). Treatment allocation seemed to have no effect on breast cancer outcome among 1248 women with ER-negative disease, and an intermediate effect among 4800 women with unknown ER status. Among all 12 894 women, mortality without recurrence from causes other than breast cancer was little affected (691 deaths without recurrence in 6454 women allocated to continue versus 679 deaths in 6440 controls; RR 0·99 [0·89–1·10]; p=0·84). For the incidence (hospitalisation or death) rates of specific diseases, RRs were as follows: pulmonary embolus 1·87 (95\% CI 1·13–3·07, p=0·01 [including 0·2\% mortality in both treatment groups]), stroke 1·06 (0·83–1·36), ischaemic heart disease 0·76 (0·60–0·95, p=0·02), and endometrial cancer 1·74 (1·30–2·34, p=0·0002). The cumulative risk of endometrial cancer during years 5–14 was 3·1\% (mortality 0·4\%) for women allocated to continue versus 1·6\% (mortality 0·2\%) for controls (absolute mortality increase 0·2\%).

Interpretation
For women with ER-positive disease, continuing tamoxifen to 10 years rather than stopping at 5 years produces a further reduction in recurrence and mortality, particularly after year 10. These results, taken together with results from previous trials of 5 years of tamoxifen treatment versus none, suggest that 10 years of tamoxifen treatment can approximately halve breast cancer mortality during the second decade after diagnosis.

Exploiting the parallels with the psychoactive effects and uses of recreational substances helps to highlight the psychoactive properties of psychiatric medications and their impact on people with psychiatric problems.

We examine the issue of dependence, and the need for support for people wishing to withdraw from psychiatric medication. We consider how the reality of psychoactive effects undermines the idea that psychiatric drugs work by targeting underlying disease processes, since psychoactive effects can themselves directly modify mental and behavioral symptoms and thus affect the results of placebo-controlled trials. These effects and their impact also raise questions about the validity and importance of modern diagnosis systems. Extensive research is needed to clarify the range of acute and longer-term mental, behavioral, and physical effects induced by psychiatric drugs, both during and after consumption and withdrawal, to enable users and prescribers to exploit their psychoactive effects judiciously in a safe and more informed manner.},

	abstract = {Antidepressant medications are the first-line treatment for people meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. Most antidepressants are designed to perturb the mechanisms that regulate the neurotransmitter serotonin – an evolutionarily ancient biochemical found in plants, animals, and fungi. Many adaptive processes evolved to be regulated by serotonin, including emotion, development, neuronal growth and death, platelet activation and the clotting process, attention, electrolyte balance, and reproduction. It is a principle of evolutionary medicine that the disruption of evolved adaptations will degrade biological functioning. Because serotonin regulates many adaptive processes, antidepressants could have many adverse health effects. For instance, while antidepressants are modestly effective in reducing depressive symptoms, they increase the brain’s susceptibility to future episodes after they have been discontinued. Contrary to a widely held belief in psychiatry, studies that purport to show that antidepressants promote neurogenesis are flawed because they all use a method that cannot, by itself, distinguish between neurogenesis and neuronal death. In fact, antidepressants cause neuronal damage and mature neurons to revert to an immature state, both of which may explain why antidepressants also cause neurons to undergo apoptosis (programmed death). Antidepressants can also cause developmental problems, they have adverse effects on sexual and romantic life, and they increase the risk of hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood plasma), bleeding, stroke, and death in the elderly. Our review supports the conclusion that antidepressants generally do more harm than good by disrupting a number of adaptive processes regulated by serotonin. However, there may be specific conditions for which their use is warranted (e.g., cancer, recovery from stroke). We conclude that altered informed consent practices and greater caution in the prescription of antidepressants are warranted.},

In this study, we aimed at defining more precisely the response to antidepressants among suicidal patients and the threshold of suicidality that best predicts a poor response.
METHOD: We investigated the short-term response to a new antidepressant treatment of 4,041 depressed outpatients depending on their suicidal status (passive or active suicidal ideation (SI), history of suicide attempts [SAs]), either self-rated or clinician-rated. Depression outcomes, measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and remission rates were compared depending on suicidal status at baseline using logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Using either a qualitative or a quantitative approach to measure SI, we found that suicidal patients were less likely to improve or attain remission, but not more likely to worsen, than nonsuicidal patients. In the multivariate analyses, SI (odds ratio [OR] = 1.40; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-1.65) and a history of SA (OR = 1.39; 95\% CI: 1.16-1.66) were the best predictors of nonremission, independently of the class of antidepressant treatment.
CONCLUSION: Antidepressant treatment seems to be less effective among those patients that need it most. Clinical trials including suicidal patients are needed to investigate specific treatment options.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Only a few studies have investigated the factors associated with suicidal behavior after antidepressant treatment onset in adults. We examined the specific predictors of de novo suicidal ideas or attempts among depressed patients in the community, including subjects potentially at risk of suicidal behaviors, who initiated a new antidepressant treatment.
METHODS: A large set of GPs and psychiatrists throughout France followed-up, for 6 weeks, 4357 outpatients for whom an antidepressant drug was prescribed. Dimensions related with antidepressant-induced suicidal events, such as depression, anxiety or hopelessness, were assessed longitudinally using univariate and multivariate approaches among subjects with treatment-emergent suicide ideation or attempts.
RESULTS: New suicidal ideas were observed in 9\% of patients with no suicidal ideation at baseline (n=81), while suicidal attempts were reported for 1.7\% of the sample during the 6-week observation period (n=75). The onset of suicidal ideas and attempts was associated with the initial features of the patients (baseline level of anxiety, past history of suicide attempts and alcohol misuse) and the non-improvement of depression. Worsening of depressive symptoms during the follow-up increased the onset of new suicidal ideas (OR=5.67, p{\textless}0.001) and attempts (OR=2.60, p=0.002), corresponding to 67.5\% and 56.5\% of attributable risk respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: When the analyses are restricted to the occurrence of suicidal ideas or attempts, the link between antidepressants and suicide risk might be more adequately explained by a poor response to antidepressant treatment rather than by a direct trigger-effect.

The average benefit of these drugs based on the FDA data was of small magnitude, while the published literature suggested larger benefits.

Drug-placebo differences increased with increasing baseline severity and the difference became large enough to be clinically important only in the very small minority of patient populations with severe major depression.

	abstract = {Background
The evidence on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for major depressive disorder is unclear.

Methods
Our objective was to conduct a systematic review assessing the effects of SSRIs versus placebo, ‘active’ placebo, or no intervention in adult participants with major depressive disorder. We searched for eligible randomised clinical trials in The Cochrane Library’s CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycLIT, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index Expanded, clinical trial registers of Europe and USA, websites of pharmaceutical companies, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the European Medicines Agency until January 2016. All data were extracted by at least two independent investigators. We used Cochrane systematic review methodology, Trial Sequential Analysis, and calculation of Bayes factor. An eight-step procedure was followed to assess if thresholds for statistical and clinical significance were crossed. Primary outcomes were reduction of depressive symptoms, remission, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were suicides, suicide attempts, suicide ideation, and quality of life.

Results
A total of 131 randomised placebo-controlled trials enrolling a total of 27,422 participants were included. None of the trials used ‘active’ placebo or no intervention as control intervention. All trials had high risk of bias. SSRIs significantly reduced the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at end of treatment (mean difference −1.94 HDRS points; 95\% CI −2.50 to −1.37; P {\textless} 0.00001; 49 trials; Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted CI −2.70 to −1.18); Bayes factor below predefined threshold (2.01*10−23). The effect estimate, however, was below our predefined threshold for clinical significance of 3 HDRS points. SSRIs significantly decreased the risk of no remission (RR 0.88; 95\% CI 0.84 to 0.91; P {\textless} 0.00001; 34 trials; Trial Sequential Analysis adjusted CI 0.83 to 0.92); Bayes factor (1426.81) did not confirm the effect). SSRIs significantly increased the risks of serious adverse events (OR 1.37; 95\% CI 1.08 to 1.75; P = 0.009; 44 trials; Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted CI 1.03 to 1.89). This corresponds to 31/1000 SSRI participants will experience a serious adverse event compared with 22/1000 control participants. SSRIs also significantly increased the number of non-serious adverse events. There were almost no data on suicidal behaviour, quality of life, and long-term effects.

Conclusions
SSRIs might have statistically significant effects on depressive symptoms, but all trials were at high risk of bias and the clinical significance seems questionable. SSRIs significantly increase the risk of both serious and non-serious adverse events. The potential small beneficial effects seem to be outweighed by harmful effects.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment-resistant and chronic depression appear to be increasing. The recent identification of antidepressant tachyphylaxis, the loss of antidepressant efficacy over time, is only a partial explanation. This is an emerging evidence that, in some individuals, persistent use of antidepressants may be prodepressant.
METHODS: A literature search of PubMed utilizing the terms: antidepressant tachyphylaxis, treatment-resistant depression, chronic depression, and antidepressant tolerance was performed, and relevant articles were used.
RESULTS: Depressed patients who ultimately become treatment resistant frequently have had a positive initial response to antidepressants and invariably have received these agents for prolonged time periods at high doses. Parallels between this course and tardive dyskinesia are noted. It is proposed that neuroplastic processes related to dendritic arborization may underlie the treatment resistant depression that occurs in the setting of chronic antidepressant use. Since the prodepressant effect is seen after prolonged antidepressant use, the term tardive dysphoria is proposed.
CONCLUSIONS: Tardive dysphoria, needs to be considered in studies of treatment resistant depression, and should be examined in blinded, randomized antidepressant discontinuation trials.},

	volume = {64},
	issn = {0160-6689},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The possibility that antidepressant drugs, while effectively treating depression, may worsen its course has received inadequate attention.
METHOD: A review of the literature suggesting potential depressogenic effects of long-term treatment with antidepressant drugs was performed. A MEDLINE search was conducted using the keywords tolerance, sensitization, antidepressive agents, and switching. This was supplemented by a manual search of Index Medicus under the heading "antidepressant agents" and a manual search of the literature for articles pointing to paradoxical effects of antidepressants.
RESULTS: A number of reported clinical findings point to the following possibilities: very unfavorable long-term outcome of major depression treated by pharmacologic means, paradoxical (depression-inducing) effects of antidepressant drugs in some patients with mood and anxiety disturbances, antidepressant-induced switching and cycle acceleration in bipolar disorder, occurrence of tolerance to the effects of antidepressants during long-term treatment, onset of resistance upon rechallenge with the same antidepressant drug in a few patients, and withdrawal syndromes following discontinuation of mood-elevating drugs. These phenomena in susceptible individuals may be explained on the basis of the oppositional model of tolerance. Continued drug treatment may recruit processes that oppose the initial acute effects of a drug and may result in loss of clinical effect. When drug treatment ends, these processes may operate unopposed, at least for some time, and increase vulnerability to relapse.
CONCLUSION: The possibility that antidepressant drugs may worsen the course of depression needs to be tested, even though its scientific exploration is likely to encounter considerable methodological and ideological difficulties. The clinical implications of this hypothesis in depression are considerable. Antidepressant drugs are crucial in the treatment of major depressive episodes. However, appraisal of paradoxical effects that may occur in susceptible patients during long-term treatment may lead to more effective use of the drugs.},

	shorttitle = {A study of the safety and harms of antidepressant drugs for older people},
	doi = {10.3310/hta15280},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to establish the relative safety and balance of risks for antidepressant treatment in older people. The study objectives were to (1) determine relative and absolute risks of predefined adverse events in older people with depression, comparing classes of antidepressant drugs [tricyclic and related antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and other antidepressants] and commonly prescribed individual drugs with non-use of antidepressant drugs; (2) directly compare the risk of adverse events for SSRIs with TCAs; (3) determine associations with dose and duration of antidepressant medication; (4) describe patterns of antidepressant use in older people with depression; and (5) estimate costs of antidepressant medication and primary care visits.
DESIGN: A cohort study of patients aged 65 years and over diagnosed with depression.
SETTING: The study was based in 570 general practices in the UK supplying data to the QResearch database.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients diagnosed with a new episode of depression between the ages of 65 and 100 years, from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2007. Participants were followed up until 31 December 2008.
INTERVENTIONS: The exposure of interest was treatment with antidepressant medication. Antidepressant drugs were grouped into the major classes and commonly prescribed individual drugs were identified.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: There were 13 predefined outcome measures: all-cause mortality, sudden cardiac death, suicide, attempted suicide/self-harm, myocardial infarction, stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA), falls, fractures, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, epilepsy/seizures, road traffic accidents, adverse drug reactions and hyponatraemia.
RESULTS: In total, 60,746 patients were included in the study cohort. Of these, 54,038 (89.0\%) received at least one prescription for an antidepressant during follow-up. The associations with the adverse outcomes were significantly different between the classes of antidepressant drugs for seven outcomes. SSRIs were associated with the highest adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for falls [1.66, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.58 to 1.73] and hyponatraemia (1.52, 95\% CI 1.33 to 1.75), and the group of other antidepressants was associated with the highest HRs for all-cause mortality (1.66, 95\% CI 1.56 to 1.77), attempted suicide/self-harm (5.16, 95\% CI 3.90 to 6.83), stroke/TIA (1.37, 95\% CI 1.22 to 1.55), fracture (1.63, 95\% CI 1.45 to 1.83) and epilepsy/seizures (2.24, 95\% CI 1.60 to 3.15) compared with when antidepressants were not being used. TCAs did not have the highest HR for any of the outcomes. There were also significantly different associations between the individual drugs for seven outcomes, with trazodone, mirtazapine and venlafaxine associated with the highest rates for several of these outcomes. The mean incremental cost (for all antidepressant prescriptions) ranged between £51.58 (amitriptyline) and £641.18 (venlafaxine) over the 5-year post-diagnosis period.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found associations between use of antidepressant drugs and a number of adverse events in older people. There was no evidence that SSRIs or drugs in the group of other antidepressants were associated with a reduced risk of any of the adverse outcomes compared with TCAs; however, they may be associated with an increased risk for certain outcomes. Among individual drugs trazodone, mirtazapine and venlafaxine were associated with the highest rates for some outcomes. Indication bias and residual confounding may explain some of the study findings. The risks of prescribing antidepressants need to be weighed against the potential benefits of these drugs.

With prescriptions of stimulants on the rise, it is important to examine the cognitive effects of low and moderate doses of stimulants, rather than only those typical of addicts.

Methods
The present study examined the effects a range of doses (0.005 â€“ 8 mg/kg) of d-amphetamine sulfate on cued and contextual Pavlovian fear conditioning in mice.

Results
In agreement with previous research, subjects administered a moderately high dose of amphetamine (8 mg/kg) pre-training, typical of what addicts might take, displayed impaired memory when tested, off-drug. Alternately, subjects injected with a very low dose of amphetamine (0.005, 0.025, or 0.05 mg/kg), pre-training, similar to the therapeutic doses for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, displayed enhanced memory when tested, off-drug. A control study showed these effects were not due to state-dependent learning.

Conclusions
Thus, dose is a critical determinant of the cognitive effects of psychostimulants.},

	abstract = {Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a chronic and extremely debilitating illness characterized by prolonged fatigue and multiple symptoms with unknown cause, diagnostic test, or universally effective treatment. Inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and CoQ10 deficiency have been well documented in CFS. We conducted an 8-week, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the benefits of oral CoQ10 (200 mg/day) plus NADH (20 mg/day) supplementation on fatigue and biochemical parameters in 73 Spanish CFS patients. This study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02063126). A significant improvement of fatigue showing a reduction in fatigue impact scale total score (p{\textless}0.05) was reported in treated group versus placebo. In addition, a recovery of the biochemical parameters was also reported. NAD+/NADH (p{\textless}0.001), CoQ10 (p{\textless}0.05), ATP (p{\textless}0.05), and citrate synthase (p{\textless}0.05) were significantly higher, and lipoperoxides (p{\textless}0.05) were significantly lower in blood mononuclear cells of the treated group. These observations lead to the hypothesis that the oral CoQ10 plus NADH supplementation could confer potential therapeutic benefits on fatigue and biochemical parameters in CFS. Larger sample trials are warranted to confirm these findings. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 22, 679–685.},

	abstract = {Background
Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is characterised by unexplained fatigue for at least 6 months accompanied by a diverse but consistent set of symptoms. Diet modification and nutritional supplements could be used to improve patient outcomes, such fatigue and quality of life. We reviewed and discussed the evidence for nutritional interventions that may assist in alleviating symptoms of CFS/ME.

Methods
Medline, Cinahl and Scopus were systematically searched from 1994 to May 2016. All studies on nutrition intervention were included where CFS/ME patients modified their diet or supplemented their habitual diet on patient‐centred outcomes (fatigue, quality of life, physical activity and/or psychological wellbeing).

Results
Seventeen studies were included that meet the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14 different interventions were investigated on study outcomes. Many studies did not show therapeutic benefit on CFS/ME. Improvements in fatigue were observed for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride (NADH), probiotics, high cocoa polyphenol rich chocolate, and a combination of NADH and coenzyme Q10.

Conclusions
This review identified insufficient evidence for the use of nutritional supplements and elimination or modified diets to relieve CFS/ME symptoms. Studies were limited by the number of studies investigating the interventions, small sample sizes, study duration, variety of instruments used, and studies not reporting dietary intake method. Further research is warranted in homogeneous CFS/ME populations.},

We targeted 612 metabolites in plasma from 63 biochemical pathways by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization, and tandem mass spectrometry in a single-injection method. Patients with CFS showed abnormalities in 20 metabolic pathways. Eighty percent of the diagnostic metabolites were decreased, consistent with a hypometabolic syndrome. Pathway abnormalities included sphingolipid, phospholipid, purine, cholesterol, microbiome, pyrroline-5-carboxylate, riboflavin, branch chain amino acid, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial metabolism. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve analysis showed diagnostic accuracies of 94\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 84–100\%] in males using eight metabolites and 96\% (95\% CI, 86–100\%) in females using 13 metabolites.

	abstract = {Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating and complex disorder characterized by unexplained fatigue not improved by rest. An area of investigation is the likely connection of CFS with defective mitochondrial function. In a previous work, we investigated the proteomic salivary profile in a couple of monozygotic twins discordant for CFS. Following this work, we analyzed mitochondrial proteins in the same couple of twins. Nano-liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS) was used to study the mitochondria extracted from platelets of the twins. Subsequently, we selected three proteins that were validated using western blot analysis in a big cohort of subjects (n=45 CFS; n=45 healthy), using whole saliva (WS). The selected proteins were as follows: aconitate hydratase (ACON), ATP synthase subunit beta (ATPB) and malate dehydrogenase (MDHM). Results for ATPB and ACON confirmed their upregulation in CFS. However, the MDHM alteration was not confirmed. Thereafter, seeing the great variability of clinical features of CFS patients, we decided to analyze the expression of our proteins after splitting patients according to clinical parameters. For each marker, the values were actually higher in the group of patients who had clinical features similar to the ill twin. In conclusion, these results suggest that our potential markers could be one of the criteria to be taken into account for helping in diagnosis. Furthermore, the identification of biomarkers present in particular subgroups of CFS patients may help in shedding light upon the complex entity of CFS. Moreover, it could help in developing tailored treatments.},

	abstract = {Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating disease characterized by physical and mental exhaustion. The underlying pathogenesis is unknown, but impairments in certain mitochondrial functions have been found in some CFS patients. To thoroughly reveal mitochondrial deficiencies in CFS patients, here we examine the key aspects of mitochondrial function in blood cells from a paired CFS patient-control series. Surprisingly, we discover that in patients the ATP levels are higher and mitochondrial cristae are more condensed compared to their paired controls, while the mitochondrial crista length, mitochondrial size, shape, density, membrane potential, and enzymatic activities of the complexes in the electron transport chain remain intact. We further show that the increased ATP largely comes from non-mitochondrial sources. Our results indicate that the fatigue symptom in this cohort of patients is unlikely caused by lack of ATP and severe mitochondrial malfunction. On the contrary, it might be linked to a pathological mechanism by which more ATP is produced by non-mitochondrial sources.  Journal of Nature and Science (JNSCI), 2(10):e221, 2016},

Metabolic dysfunction is a plausible contributing factor. We hypothesized that changes in serum amino acids may disclose specific defects in energy metabolism in ME/CFS. Analysis in 200 ME/CFS patients and 102 healthy individuals showed a specific reduction of amino acids that fuel oxidative metabolism via the TCA cycle, mainly in female ME/CFS patients. Serum 3-methylhistidine, a marker of endogenous protein catabolism, was significantly increased in male patients. The amino acid pattern suggested functional impairment of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), supported by increased mRNA expression of the inhibitory PDH kinases 1, 2, and 4; sirtuin 4; and PPARδ in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from both sexes. Myoblasts grown in presence of serum from patients with severe ME/CFS showed metabolic adaptations, including increased mitochondrial respiration and excessive lactate secretion. The amino acid changes could not be explained by symptom severity, disease duration, age, BMI, or physical activity level among patients. These findings are in agreement with the clinical disease presentation of ME/CFS, with inadequate ATP generation by oxidative phosphorylation and excessive lactate generation upon exertion., Chronic fatigue syndrome is associated with specific reductions of amino acids fueling tricarboxylic acid cycle and upregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinases, indicating impaired PDH function.},

	abstract = {Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) remains a continuum spectrum disease without biomarkers or simple objective tests, and therefore relies on a diagnosis from a set of symptoms to link the assortment of brain and body disorders to ME/CFS. Although recent studies show various affected pathways, the underlying basis of ME/CFS has yet to be established. In this pilot study, we compare plasma metabolic signatures in a discovery cohort, 17 patients and 15 matched controls, and explore potential metabolic perturbations as the aftermath of the complex interactions between genes, transcripts and proteins. This approach to examine the complex array of symptoms and underlying foundation of ME/CFS revealed 74 differentially accumulating metabolites, out of 361 (P {\textless} 0.05), and 35 significantly altered after statistical correction (Q {\textless} 0.15). The latter list includes several essential energy-related compounds which could theoretically be linked to the general lack of energy observed in ME/CFS patients. Pathway analysis points to a few pathways with high impact and therefore potential disturbances in patients, mainly taurine metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism, combined with primary bile acid metabolism, as well as glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and a few other pathways, all involved broadly in fatty acid metabolism. Purines, including ADP and ATP, pyrimidines and several amino acid metabolic pathways were found to be significantly disturbed. Finally, glucose and oxaloacetate were two main metabolites affected that have a major effect on sugar and energy levels. Our work provides a prospective path for diagnosis and understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ME/CFS.},

To determine whether a signature of serum cytokines could be associated with ME/CFS and correlated with disease severity and fatigue duration, cytokines of 192 ME/CFS patients and 392 healthy controls were measured using a 51-multiplex array on a Luminex system. Each cytokine’s preprocessed data were regressed on ME/CFS severity plus covariates for age, sex, race, and an assay property of newly discovered importance: nonspecific binding. On average, TGF-β was elevated (P = 0.0052) and resistin was lower (P = 0.0052) in patients compared with controls. Seventeen cytokines had a statistically significant upward linear trend that correlated with ME/CFS severity: CCL11 (Eotaxin-1), CXCL1 (GROα), CXCL10 (IP-10), IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17F, leptin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, LIF, NGF, SCF, and TGF-α.

	abstract = {Background
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) studies from our laboratory and others have described cytokine abnormalities. Other studies reported no difference between CFS and controls. However, methodologies varied widely and few studies measured more than 4 or 5 cytokines. Multiplex technology permits the determination of cytokines for a large panel of cytokines simultaneously with high sensitivity and with only 30 ul of plasma per sample. No widely accepted laboratory test or marker is available for the diagnosis or prognosis of CFS. This study screened plasma factors to identify circulating biomarkers associated with CFS.

Methods
Cytokines were measured in plasma from female CFS cases and female healthy controls. Multiplex technology provided profiles of 16 plasma factors including the pro -inflammatory cytokines: tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), lymphotoxin α (LTα), interleukin (IL) - IL-Iα, IL-1β, IL-6; TH1 cytokines: interferon γ (IFNγ), IL-12p70, IL-2, IL-15; TH2: IL-4, IL-5; TH17 cytokines, IL-17 and IL-23; anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10, IL-13; the inflammatory mediator and neutrophil attracting chemokine IL-8 (CXCL8). Analysis by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve assessed the biomarker potential of each cytokine.

Results
The following cytokines were elevated in CFS compared to controls: LTα, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-12. The following cytokines were decreased in CFS: IL-8, IL-13 and IL-15. The following cytokines were not different: TNFα, IFNγ, IL-2, IL-10, IL-23 and IL-17. Applying (ROC) curve analyses, areas under the curves (AUC) for IL-5 (0. 84), LTα (0.77), IL-4 (0.77), IL-12 (0.76) indicated good biomarker potential. The AUC of IL-6 (0.73), IL-15 (0.73), IL-8 (0.69), IL-13 (0.68) IL-1α (0.62), IL-1β (0.62) showed fair potential as biomarkers.

Conclusion
Cytokine abnormalities are common in CFS. In this study, 10 of 16 cytokines examined showed good to fair promise as biomarkers. However, the cytokine changes observed are likely to more indicative of immune activation and inflammation, rather than specific for CFS. As such, they are targets for herapeutic strategies. Newer techniques allow evaluation of large panels of cytokines in a cost effective fashion.},

There are no validated laboratory tests for diagnosis or management despite global efforts to find biomarkers of disease. We considered the possibility that inability to identify such biomarkers reflected variations in diagnostic criteria and laboratory methods as well as the timing of sample collection during the course of the illness. Accordingly, we leveraged two large, multicenter cohort studies of ME/CFS to assess the relationship of immune signatures with diagnosis, illness duration, and other clinical variables. Controls were frequency-matched on key variables known to affect immune status, including season of sampling and geographic site, in addition to age and sex. We report here distinct alterations in plasma immune signatures early in the course of ME/CFS (n = 52) relative to healthy controls (n = 348) that are not present in subjects with longer duration of illness (n = 246). Analyses based on disease duration revealed that early ME/CFS cases had a prominent activation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as dissociation of intercytokine regulatory networks. We found a stronger correlation of cytokine alterations with illness duration than with measures of illness severity, suggesting that the immunopathology of ME/CFS is not static. These findings have critical implications for discovery of interventional strategies and early diagnosis of ME/CFS.
Cytokine alterations are more strongly correlated with illness duration than with measures of illness severity.

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that energy metabolism is disturbed in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients and animal models. Treatment with triheptanoin, the triglyceride of heptanoate, is a promising approach to provide alternative fuel to improve oxidative phosphorylation and aid ATP generation. Heptanoate can be metabolized to propionyl-CoA, which after carboxylation can produce succinyl-CoA and thereby re-fill the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (anaplerosis). Here we tested the hypothesis that treatment with triheptanoin prevents motor neuron loss and delays the onset of disease symptoms in female mice overexpressing the mutant human SOD1G93A (hSOD1G93A) gene. When oral triheptanoin (35\% of caloric content) was initiated at P35, motor neuron loss at 70 days of age was attenuated by 33\%. In untreated hSOD1G93A mice, the loss of hind limb grip strength began at 16.7 weeks. Triheptanoin maintained hind limb grip strength for 2.8 weeks longer (p{\textless}0.01). Loss of balance on the rotarod and reduction of body weight were delayed by 13 and 11 days respectively (both p{\textless}0.01). Improved motor function occurred in parallel with alterations in the expression of genes associated with muscle metabolism. In gastrocnemius muscles, the mRNA levels of pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate and succinate dehydrogenases and methyl-malonyl mutase were reduced by 24–33\% in 10 week old hSOD1G93A mice when compared to wild-type mice, suggesting that TCA cycling in skeletal muscle may be slowed in this ALS mouse model at a stage when muscle strength is still normal. At 25 weeks of age, mRNA levels of succinate dehydrogenases, glutamic pyruvic transaminase 2 and the propionyl carboxylase β subunit were reduced by 69–84\% in control, but not in triheptanoin treated hSOD1G93A animals. Taken together, our results suggest that triheptanoin slows motor neuron loss and the onset of motor symptoms in ALS mice by improving TCA cycling.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A crosstalk between the immune system and depression has been postulated, with monocytes/macrophages and cytokines having a key role in this interaction. In this study, we examined whether vortioxetine, a multimodal anti-depressive drug, was endowed with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activity, leading to immunomodulatory effects on human monocytes and macrophages.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Human monocytes were isolated from buffy coats and used as such or differentiated into M1 and M2 macrophages. Cells were treated with vortioxetine before or after differentiation, and their responsiveness was evaluated. This included oxy-radical and TNFα production, TNFα and PPARγ gene expression and NF-κB translocation.
KEY RESULTS: Vortioxetine significantly reduced the PMA-induced oxidative burst in monocytes and in macrophages (M1 and M2), causing a concomitant shift of macrophages from the M1 to the M2 phenotype, demonstrated by a significant decrease in the expression of the surface marker CD86 and an increase in CD206. Moreover, treatment of monocytes with vortioxetine rendered macrophages derived from this population less sensitive to PMA, as it reduced the oxidative burst, NF-kB translocation, TNFα release and expression while inducing PPARγ gene expression. FACS analysis showed a significant decrease in the CD14+ /CD16+ /CD86+ M1 population.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results demonstrate that in human monocytes/macrophages, vortioxetine has antioxidant activity and anti-inflammatory effects driving the polarization of macrophages towards their alternative phenotype. These findings suggest that vortioxetine, alongside its antidepressive effect, may have immunomodulatory properties.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: A close relationship appears to exist between 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-induced changes in core body temperature and long-term serotonin (5-HT) loss.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether changes in core body temperature affect MDMA metabolism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were treated with MDMA at ambient temperatures of 15, 21.5, or 30 degrees C to prevent or exacerbate MDMA-induced hyperthermia. Plasma concentrations of MDMA and its main metabolites were determined for 6 h. Seven days later, animals were killed and brain indole content was measured.
RESULTS: The administration of MDMA at 15 degrees C blocked the hyperthermic response and long-term 5-HT depletion found in rats treated at 21.5 degrees C. At 15 degrees C, plasma concentrations of MDMA were significantly increased, whereas those of three of its main metabolites were reduced when compared to rats treated at 21.5 degrees C. By contrast, hyperthermia and indole deficits were exacerbated in rats treated at 30 degrees C. Noteworthy, plasma concentrations of MDMA metabolites were greatly enhanced in these animals. Instrastriatal perfusion of MDMA (100 microM for 5 h at 21 degrees C) did not potentiate the long-term depletion of 5-HT after systemic MDMA. Furthermore, interfering in MDMA metabolism using the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor entacapone potentiated the neurotoxicity of MDMA, indicating that metabolites that are substrates for this enzyme may contribute to neurotoxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing a direct relationship between core body temperature and MDMA metabolism. This finding has implications on both the temperature dependence of the mechanism of MDMA neurotoxicity and human use, as hyperthermia is often associated with MDMA use in humans.},

	abstract = {Extension of shelf life and preservation of products are both very important for the food industry. However, just as with other processes, speed and higher manufacturing performance are also beneficial. Although microwave heating is utilized in a number of industrial processes, there are many unanswered questions about its effects on foods. Here we analyze whether the effects of microwave heating with continuous flow are equivalent to those of traditional heat transfer methods. In our study, the effects of heating of liquid foods by conventional and continuous flow microwave heating were studied. Among other properties, we compared the stability of the liquid foods between the two heat treatments. Our goal was to determine whether the continuous flow microwave heating and the conventional heating methods have the same effects on the liquid foods, and, therefore, whether microwave heat treatment can effectively replace conventional heat treatments. We have compared the colour, separation phenomena of the samples treated by different methods. For milk, we also monitored the total viable cell count, for orange juice, vitamin C contents in addition to the taste of the product by sensory analysis. The majority of the results indicate that the circulating coil microwave method used here is equivalent to the conventional heating method based on thermal conduction and convection. However, some results in the analysis of the milk samples show clear differences between heat transfer methods. According to our results, the colour parameters (lightness, red-green and blue-yellow values) of the microwave treated samples differed not only from the untreated control, but also from the traditional heat treated samples. The differences are visually undetectable, however, they become evident through analytical measurement with spectrophotometer. This finding suggests that besides thermal effects, microwave-based food treatment can alter product properties in other ways as well.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Stimulation of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and related compounds such as psilocybin has previously been shown to increase primary process thinking â€“ an ontologically and evolutionary early, implicit, associative, and automatic mode of thinking which is typically occurring during altered states of consciousness such as dreaming. However, it is still largely unknown whether LSD induces primary process thinking under placebo-controlled, standardized experimental conditions and whether these effects are related to subjective experience and 5-HT2A receptor activation. Therefore, this study aimed to test the hypotheses that LSD increases primary process thinking and that primary process thinking depends on 5-HT2A receptor activation and is related to subjective drug effects. Methods: Twenty-five healthy subjects performed an audio-recorded mental imagery task 7 h after drug administration during three drug conditions: placebo, LSD (100 mcg orally) and LSD together with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg orally). The main outcome variable in this study was primary index (PI), a formal measure of primary process thinking in the imagery reports. State of consciousness was evaluated using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) rating scale. Results: LSD, compared with placebo, significantly increased primary index (p {\textless} 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected). The LSD-induced increase in primary index was positively correlated with LSD-induced disembodiment (p {\textless} 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected), and blissful state (p {\textless} 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected) on the 5D-ASC. Both LSD-induced increases in primary index and changes in state of consciousness were fully blocked by ketanserin. Conclusion: LSD induces primary process thinking via activation of 5-HT2A receptors and in relation to disembodiment and blissful state. Primary process thinking appears to crucially organize inner experiences during both dreams and psychedelic states of consciousness.},

Specifically, we propose that Freud’s descriptions of the primary and secondary processes are consistent with self-organized activity in hierarchical cortical systems and that his descriptions of the ego are consistent with the functions of the default-mode and its reciprocal exchanges with subordinate brain systems. This neurobiological account rests on a view of the brain as a hierarchical inference or Helmholtz machine. In this view, large-scale intrinsic networks occupy supraordinate levels of hierarchical brain systems that try to optimize their representation of the sensorium. This optimization has been formulated as minimizing a free-energy; a process that is formally similar to the treatment of energy in Freudian formulations. We substantiate this synthesis by showing that Freud’s descriptions of the primary process are consistent with the phenomenology and neurophysiology of rapid eye movement sleep, the early and acute psychotic state, the aura of temporal lobe epilepsy and hallucinogenic drug states.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease the most common form of dementia in the elderly is a neurodegenerative disease that affects 44 millions of people worldwide. The first treatments against Alzheimer’s disease are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; however, these medications are associated with many side effects. Dichrocephala integrifolia is a traditional herb widely used by indigenous population of Cameroon to treat and prevent Alzheimer disease and for memory improvement. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the decoction prepared from leaves of Dichrocephala integrifolia, on scopolamine-induced memory impairment in mice. Seven groups of six animals were used. The first two groups received distilled water for the distilled water and scopolamine groups. The four test groups received one of the four doses of the decoction of the plant (35, 87.5, 175 or 350 mg/kg p.o) and the positive control group received tacrine (10 mg/kg), a cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, during 10 consecutive days. Scopolamine (1 mg/kg), a cholinergic receptor blocker, administered 30 min after treatments, was used to induce memory impairment to all groups except the distilled water group on day 10 of drug treatment. The behavioral paradigms used to evaluate the effects of the treatment were the elevated plus maze for learning and memory, Y maze for spatial short-term memory, the novel objet recognition for recognition memory and Morris water maze for the evaluation of spatial long-term memory. After behavioral tests, animals were sacrificed and brains of a subset were used for the assessment of some biomarkers of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione levels) and for the evaluation of the acethylcholinesterase activity. From the remaining subset brains, histopathological analysis was performed. The results of this study showed that, D. integrifolia at the doses of 87.5 and 350 mg/kg significantly (p{\textless}0.01) improved spatial short-term and long-term memory, by increasing the percentage of spontaneous alternation in the Y maze and reducing the escape latency in the Morris water maze. Furthermore, the results of histopathological evaluation showed that D. integrifolia attenuated the neuronal death in the hippocampus induced by scopolamine. The main finding of this work is that D. integrifolia improves learning.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Gradual population aging is creating a new set of needs in the general population. Memory capacity decreases with age, and memory deficits are considered an early symptom of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), one of the most prevalent cognitive disorders in older people. Numerous studies have shown that grape polyphenolic compounds (GPs) are able to attenuate cognitive impairment and reduce brain lesions in experimental AD animal models. These GP effects are associated with improvement in brain antioxidant status and prevention of free radical-induced neuronal damage. We designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to investigate the potential beneficial effects of a Vitis vinifera-based dietary supplement on cognitive function and neuropsychological status in healthy older adults. Methods: One-hundred eleven subjects were recruited and randomly divided in two groups: one group received the Vitis vinifera-based dietary supplement Cognigrape® for 12 weeks (250 mg/day) and the second group received placebo over the same period of time. Before and after the end of the supplementation period, cognitive function and neuropsychological status were evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), and Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) evaluations. Results: MMSE scores were significantly improved after supplementation with Cognigrape® in comparison with baseline levels (p {\textless}0.0001) and placebo (r = 0.59, 0.95\% CI 0.11, 1.22; p {\textless}0.0001). Cognigrape® supplementation produced a significant reduction in BDI (-15.8\%) and HARS (-24.9\%) scores with respect to baseline levels (p {\textless}0.0001) and placebo (p {\textless}0.0001 for BDI and p {\textless}0.05 for HARS). RBANS total score was significantly improved by Cognigrape® with respect to baseline levels and placebo (r = 0.55, 0.95\% CI 0.48, 6.07; p {\textless}0.0001). The comparison with the placebo revealed improvements in several parameters among participants receiving Cognigrape®: attention (p {\textless}0.001); language (p {\textless}0.05); immediate memory (p {\textless}0.0001); and delayed memory (p {\textless}0.0001). Visuospatial/constructional abilities were not modified. During the study, no adverse effects were detected. Conclusions: The results show that 12 weeks of Cognigrape® supplementation is safe, can improve physiological cognitive profiles, and can concurrently ameliorate negative neuropsychological status in healthy older adults.},

	abstract = {Prefrontal-subcortical circuits support executive functions which often become dysfunctional in psychiatric disorders. Vortioxetine is a multimodal antidepressant that is currently used in the clinic to treat major depressive disorder. Mechanisms of action of vortioxetine include serotonin (5-HT) transporter blockade, 5-HT1A receptor agonism, 5-HT1B receptor partial agonism, and 5-HT1D, 5-HT3, and 5-HT7 receptor antagonism. Vortioxetine facilitates 5-HT transmission in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), however the impact of this compound on related prefrontal-subcortical circuits is less clear. Thus, the current study examined the impact of systemic vortioxetine administration (0.8 mg/kg, i.v.) on spontaneous spiking and spikes evoked by electrical stimulation of the mPFC in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial shell of the nucleus accumbens (msNAc), and lateral septal nucleus (LSN) in urethane-anesthetized rats. We also examined whether vortioxetine modulated afferent drive in the msNAc from hippocampal fimbria (HF) inputs. Similar studies were performed using the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram (1.6 mg/kg, i.v.) to enable comparisons between the multimodal actions of vortioxetine and SSRI-mediated effects. No significant differences in spontaneous activity were observed in the ACC, msNAc, and LSN across treatment groups. No significant impact of treatment on mPFC-evoked responses was observed in the ACC. In contrast, vortioxetine decreased mPFC-evoked activity recorded in the msNAc as compared to parallel studies in control and escitalopram treated groups. Thus, vortioxetine may reduce mPFC-msNAc afferent drive via a mechanism that, in addition to an SSRI-like effect, requires 5-HT receptor modulation. Recordings in the LSN revealed a significant increase in mPFC-evoked activity following escitalopram administration as compared to control and vortioxetine treated groups, indicating that complex modulation of 5-HT receptors by vortioxetine may offset SSRI-like effects in this region. Lastly, neurons in the msNAc were more responsive to stimulation of the HF following both vortioxetine and escitalopram administration, indicating that elevation of 5-HT tone and 5-HT receptor modulation may facilitate excitatory hippocampal synaptic drive in this region. The above findings point to complex 5-HT receptor-dependent effects of vortioxetine which may contribute to its unique impact on the function of prefrontal-subcortical circuits and the development of novel strategies for treating mood disorders.},

This study investigated the ability of propranolol to potentiate the antinociceptive action of morphine and the possible mechanisms underlying this effect. Antinociception was assessed in three nociceptive tests (thermal, hot plate), (chemical, acetic acid), and (inflammatory, formalin test) in mice and quantified by measuring the percent maximum possible effect, the percent inhibition of acetic acid-evoked writhing response, and the AUC values of number of flinches for treated mice, respectively. The study revealed that propranolol (0.25-20 mg/Kg, IP) administration did not produce analgesia in mice. However, 10 mg/Kg propranolol, enhanced the antinociceptive effect of sub-analgesic doses of morphine (0.2, 1, and 2 mg/Kg, IP) in the three nociceptive tests. It also shifted the dose response curve of morphine to the left. The combined effect of propranolol and morphine was attenuated by haloperidol (D2 receptor antagonist, 1.5 mg/Kg, IP), and bicuculline (GABAA receptor antagonist, 2 mg/Kg, IP). Repeated daily administration of propranolol (10 mg/Kg, IP) did not alter the nociceptive responses in the 3 pain tests, but it significantly potentiated morphine-induced antinociception in the hot plate, acetic acid-evoked writhing, and in the second phase of formalin tests. Together, the data suggest that a cross-talk exists between the opioidergic and adrenergic systems and implicate dopamine and GABA systems in this synergistic effect of morphine-propranolol combination. Propranolol may serve as an adjuvant therapy to potentiate the effect of opioid analgesics.},

	abstract = {It has been found that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is involved in memory encoding of aversive events, such as inhibitory avoidance (IA) training. Dissociable roles have been described for different mPFC subregions regarding various memory processes, wherein the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), prelimbic cortex (PL), and infralimbic cortex (IL) are involved in acquisition, retrieval, and extinction of aversive events, respectively. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that intense training impedes the effects on memory of treatments that typically interfere with memory consolidation. The aim of this work was to determine if there are differential effects on memory induced by reversible inactivation of neural activity of ACC, PL, or IL produced by tetrodotoxin (TTX) in rats trained in IA using moderate (1.0 mA) and intense (3.0 mA) foot-shocks. We found that inactivation of ACC has no effects on memory consolidation, regardless of intensity of training. PL inactivation impairs memory consolidation in the 1.0 mA group, while no effect on consolidation was produced in the 3.0 mA group. In the case of IL, a remarkable amnestic effect in LTM was observed in both training conditions. However, state-dependency can explain the amnestic effect of TTX found in the 3.0 mA IL group. In order to circumvent this effect, TTX was injected into IL immediately after training (thus avoiding state-dependency). The behavioral results are equivalent to those found after PL inactivation. Therefore, these findings provide evidence that PL and IL, but not ACC, mediate LTM of inhibitory avoidance only in moderate training.},

	abstract = {Although pain is a widely known phenomenon and an important clinical symptom that occurs in numerous diseases, its mechanisms are still barely understood. Owing to the scarce information concerning its pathophysiology, particularly what is involved in the transition from an acute state to a chronic condition, pain treatment is frequently unsatisfactory, therefore contributing to the amplification of the chronic pain burden. In fact, pain is an extremely complex experience that demands the recruitment of an intricate set of central nervous system (CNS) components. The mosaic designed encompassesThis includes cortical and /subcortical areas involved in interpretation of the general basic characteristics of noxious stimuli. It also comprises noxious stimuli properti other regions and neural circuits that process the motivational- and affective pain dimensions of pain. Hence, the reward circuitry represents a vital element for pain experience and modulation. This review article focuses on the interpretation of the extensive data available connecting the major components of the reward circuitry to pain suffering, including the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area and the medial prefrontal cortex; with especial particular attentionattention dedicated to the evaluation of neuroplastic changes affecting these structures found in chronic pain syndromes, such as migraine, trigeminal neuropathic pain, chronic back pain (CBP) and fibromyalgia.},

Although use of these methods is increasing rapidly, their effectiveness remains questionable. Notably, cognitive enhancement studies have typically failed to consider participants’ expectations. However, high expectations could easily make brain-training approaches appear more effective than they actually are. We addressed this major gap in the literature by assessing the perceived effectiveness of brain training and NIBS in a series of surveys. Our results suggest that people are optimistic about the possibilities of cognitive enhancement, particularly through brain training. Moreover, reading a brief message implying high or low effectiveness of such methods can raise or lower expectations, respectively, suggesting that perceptions of brain training are malleable—at least in the short term. Measuring expectations in brain training and NIBS is important to determining whether these cognitive enhancement methods truly are effective.},

Tianeptine is an effective antidepressant with a previously unknown mechanism of action. We recently reported that tianeptine is a full agonist at the mu opioid receptor (MOR). Here we demonstrate that the acute and chronic antidepressant-like behavioral effects of tianeptine in mice require MOR. Interestingly, while tianeptine also produces many opiate-like behavioral effects such as analgesia and reward, it does not lead to tolerance or withdrawal. Furthermore, the primary metabolite of tianeptine (MC5), which has a longer half-life, mimics the behavioral effects of tianeptine in a MOR-dependent fashion.

The effect of commonly used medication on subtle impairments in cognitive function may be under-recognized.ObjectiveThe aim of the review was to examine the evidence attributing amnestic or non-amnestic cognitive impairment to the use of medication with anticholinergic, antihistamine, GABAergic or opioid effects.MethodsMEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trials of adults without underlying central nervous system disorders who underwent detailed neuropsychological testing prior to and after oral administration of drugs affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, GABAergic or opioid receptor pathways. Seventy-eight studies were identified, reporting 162 trials testing medication from the four targeted drug classes. Two investigators independently appraised study quality and extracted relevant data on the occurrence of amnestic, non-amnestic or combined cognitive deficits induced by each drug class. Only trials using validated neuropsychological tests were included. Quality of the evidence for each drug class was assessed based on consistency of results across trials and the presence of a dose-response gradient.ResultsIn studies of short-, intermediate- and long-acting benzodiazepine drugs (n = 68 trials), these drugs consistently induced both amnestic and non-amnestic cognitive impairments, with evidence of a dose-response relationship. H1-antihistamine agents (n = 12) and tricyclic antidepressants (n = 15) induced non-amnestic deficits in attention and information processing. Non-benzodiazepine derivatives (n = 29) also produced combined deficits, but less consistently than benzodiazepine drugs. The evidence was inconclusive for the type of cognitive impairment induced by different bladder relaxant antimuscarinics (n = 9) as well as for narcotic agents (n = 5) and antipsychotics (n = 5). Among healthy volunteers {\textgreater}60 years of age, low doses of commonly used medications such as lorazepam 0.5 mg, oxybutynin immediate release 5 mg and oxycodone 10 mg produced combined deficits.ConclusionNon-amnestic mild cognitive deficits are consistently induced by first-generation antihistamines and tricyclic antidepressants, while benzodiazepines provoke combined amnestic and non-amnestic impairments. Risk-benefit considerations should be discussed with patients in order to enable an informed choice about drug discontinuation or substitution to potentially reverse cognitive adverse effects.},

However, biofilm formation of E. faecalis, S. aureus and two CNS strains increased at sub-MICs of NAC. Furthermore, a dose-related decrease in biofilm formation of C. ammoniagenes, M. smegmatis, P. acnes, S. pyogenes, and S. epidermidis was observed.

Apart from oxidants, cigarette smoke contains several precarcinogens, and it is surprising that not every heavy smoker becomes a victim of malignant disease. This points to the interindividual variability in susceptibility to carcinogens and there are several lines of evidence that metabolic factors are involved in such variability. Metabolism of carcinogens and also the subsequent multisteps of carcinogenesis are affected by host factors and governed by the balance between opposite forces, such as metabolic activation and detoxification, formation, and scavenging of radicals and DNA damage and repair. This implies that carcinogenic compounds can initiate tumor growth only in amounts saturating detoxification mechanisms.

	abstract = {Background
Bromelain and N-acetylcysteine are two natural, sulfhydryl-containing compounds with good safety profiles which have been investigated for their benefits and application in health and disease for more than fifty years. As such, the potential values of these agents in cancer therapy have been variably reported in the literature. In the present study, the efficacy of bromelain and N-acetylcysteine in single agent and combination treatment of human gastrointestinal carcinoma cells was evaluated in vitro and the underlying mechanisms of effect were explored.

Methods
The growth-inhibitory effects of bromelain and N-acetylcysteine, on their own and in combination, on a panel of human gastrointestinal carcinoma cell lines, including MKN45, KATO-III, HT29-5F12, HT29-5M21 and LS174T, were assessed by sulforhodamine B assay. Moreover, the influence of the treatment on the expression of a range of proteins involved in the regulation of cell cycle and survival was investigated by Western blot. The presence of apoptosis was also examined by TUNEL assay.

Results
Bromelain and N-acetylcysteine significantly inhibited cell proliferation, more potently in combination therapy. Drug-drug interaction in combination therapy was found to be predominantly synergistic or additive. Mechanistically, apoptotic bodies were detected in treated cells by TUNEL assay. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed diminution of cyclins A, B and D, the emergence of immunoreactive subunits of caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8 and cleaved PARP, withering or cleavage of procaspase-9, overexpression of cytochrome c, reduced expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-survival phospho-Akt, the emergence of the autophagosomal marker LC3-II and deregulation of other autophagy-related proteins, including Atg3, Atg5, Atg7, Atg12 and Beclin 1. These results were more prominent in combination therapy.

Conclusion
We report for the first time to our knowledge the growth-inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of bromelain and N-acetylcysteine, in particular in combination, on a panel of gastrointestinal cancer cell lines with different phenotypes and characteristics. These effects apparently resulted from cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and autophagy. Towards the development of novel strategies for the enhancement of microscopic cytoreduction, our results lay the basis for further evaluation of this formulation in locoregional approaches to peritoneal surface malignancies and carcinomatosis.},

The concept that antioxidants can help fight cancer is deeply rooted in the general population, promoted by the food supplement industry, and supported by some scientific studies. However, clinical trials have reported inconsistent results. We show that supplementing the diet with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and vitamin E markedly increases tumor progression and reduces survival in mouse models of B-RAF– and K-RAS–induced lung cancer. RNA sequencing revealed that NAC and vitamin E, which are structurally unrelated, produce highly coordinated changes in tumor transcriptome profiles, dominated by reduced expression of endogenous antioxidant genes. NAC and vitamin E increase tumor cell proliferation by reducing ROS, DNA damage, and p53 expression in mouse and human lung tumor cells. Inactivation of p53 increases tumor growth to a similar degree as antioxidants and abolishes the antioxidant effect. Thus, antioxidants accelerate tumor growth by disrupting the ROS-p53 axis. Because somatic mutations in p53 occur late in tumor progression, antioxidants may accelerate the growth of early tumors or precancerous lesions in high-risk populations such as smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who receive NAC to relieve mucus production.

Follow me on this journey where I retrace the roots of tea, the world's most widely consumed psychoactive substance, back to its mythical origin in ancient China. The story of how tea made it's way to the West is a story intertwined with recent world history but also shares the characterists with the histories of other legal and/or illegal drugs.

	abstract = {Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), a native herb of Southeast Asia, is widely known for its psychoactive properties. Recent increase in the use of kratom as a recreational drug has increased the risk of its interaction with conventional drugs if taken concomitantly. A few reports are available related to the effects of kratom on the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), but there are no reports of its effects on pregnane X receptor (PXR), a transcription factor that regulates the expression of CYPs and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of a methanolic extract of kratom leaves, an alkaloid rich fraction and its 5 indole and 4 oxindole alkaloids on PXR activation and the resulting changes in the mRNA expression of PXR target genes (CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and P-gp). A significant activation of PXR was observed by the extract (3-fold), alkaloidal fraction (4-fold) and all 9 alkaloids (4- to 6-fold) that was associated with an increased mRNA expression which resulted into an increase in the activity of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and P-gp. These results indicate that high consumption of Mitragyna speciosa extract along with the conventional drugs may lead to potential herb-drug interactions due to its effects on PXR.},

Method: Several databases were accessed for research articles on the effects of amphetamine in the brain of laboratory animals and ADHD diagnosed individuals. Results: In early studies, high doses of amphetamine, comparable to amounts used by addicts, were shown to damage dopaminergic pathways. More recent studies, using therapeutic regimens, appear contradictory. One paradigm shows significant decreases in striatal dopamine and transporter density after oral administration of “therapeutic” doses in primates. Another shows morphological evidence of “trophic” dendritic growth in the brains of adult and juvenile rats given systemic injections mimicking “therapeutic” treatment. Imaging studies of ADHD-diagnosed individuals show an increase in striatal dopamine transporter availability that may be reduced by methylphenidate treatment. Conclusion: Clarification of the neurological consequences of chronic AMPH treatment for ADHD is needed. (J. of Att. Dis. 2007; 11(1) 8-16)},

	abstract = {The prescribed use of methylphenidate (Ritalin) in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has risen dramatically in recent years. The relative roles of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in the therapeutic action of these drugs was assessed by comparing the responses of extracellular nucleus accumbens dopamine and serotonin and hippocampus norepinephrine to the acute administration of low methylphenidate and amphetamine doses. The comparative neurochemical profiles in response to methylphenidate and amphetamine suggest that the norepinephrine effects may play an important role in the therapeutic effects of low doses of psychostimulants. In addition, to assess possible long-term consequences of prolonged exposure to this drug, we examined whether changes in the locomotor response occurred with repeated administration of these stimulant doses. Threshold doses of methylphenidate (0.5–1.0 mg/kg) or amphetamine (0.1–0.25 mg/kg) were administered twice daily, and then animals were tested in response to 2.5 mg/kg methylphenidate or 0.5 mg/kg amphetamine. Our results provide evidence that low-dose stimulant administration can result in the development of behavioral sensitization, which is evident in the subsequent behavioral response to the drug. The relevance of these data to the therapeutic uses of these drugs is discussed within the context of the many variables that can affect the behavioral and neurochemical responses to stimulants.},

However, little is known about their therapeutic mechanisms or about the consequences of their long-term exposure. In the present study we investigated whether repeated exposure of a low dose of amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg) to juvenile rats could induce long-term morphological alterations in the prefrontal cortex. In addition, to assess possible behavioural consequences of prolonged exposure to this drug, we examined whether changes in the motor response to various dopamine agonists occurred after this treatment. We found that this dose of amphetamine promotes plasma concentrations of amphetamine sulphate in juvenile rats to levels corresponding to the clinical range used for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg; s.c.) was administered twice daily during postnatal days 22–34, and then the brains of the animals were evaluated 2 weeks later. This treatment produced an increase in dendritic length and branches of pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex, but not in the nucleus accumbens. These changes were associated with an increase in the expression of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, a highly abundant signalling protein in the postsynaptic densities of excitatory synapses. Interestingly, amphetamine pre-treatment did not alter the motor response to various dopamine agonists, including amphetamine. These data suggest that clinical doses of stimulant drugs may be acting as a trophic support at the glutamatergic synapses, thereby enhancing dopamine–glutamate interactions in the prefrontal cortex.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ntt.2012.01.007},
	abstract = {Previous studies focusing on amphetamine (AMPH), methamphetamine (METH) and methylphenidate (MPH) neurotoxicity have almost exclusively been conducted in rodents during the light cycle, which is when most rodents sleep. There are virtually no studies that have simultaneously compared the effects of these three stimulants on body temperature and also determined serum stimulant levels during exposure. The present study compared the effects of MPH, AMPH and METH treatment on body temperature and neurotoxicity during the waking (dark) cycle of the rat. This was done to more effectively replicate stimulant exposure in waking humans and to evaluate the relative risks of the three stimulants when taken inappropriately or non-therapeutically (e.g., abuse). Four subcutaneous injections (4×), at 2 h intervals, were used to administer each dose of the stimulants tested. Several equimolar doses for the three stimulants were chosen to produce plasma levels ranging from 3 times the highest therapeutic levels (no effect on body temperature) to those only attained by accidental overdose or intentional abuse in humans. Either 4×2.0 mg/kg AMPH or 4×2.2 mg/kg METH administered during the waking cycle resulted in peak serum levels of between 1.5 and 2.5 μM (4 to 5 times over maximum therapeutic levels of METH and AMPH) and produced lethal hyperthermia, 70\% striatal dopamine depletions, and neurodegeneration in the cortex and thalamus. These results show that METH and AMPH are equipotent at producing lethal hyperthermia and neurotoxicity in laboratory animals during the wake cycle. Administration of either 4×2.2 or 4×3.3 mg/kg METH during the sleep cycle produced lower peak body temperatures, minimal dopamine depletions and little neurodegeneration. These findings indicate that administration of the stimulant during the waking cycle compared to sleep cycle may significantly increase the potency of amphetamines to produce hyperthermia, neurotoxicity and lethality. In contrast, body temperature during the waking cycle was only significantly elevated by MPH at 4×22 mg/kg, and the serum levels producing this effect were 2-fold (approximately 4.5 μM) greater on a molar basis than hyperthermic doses of AMPH and METH. Thus, AMPH and METH were equipotent on a mg/kg body weight basis at producing hyperthermia and neurotoxicity while MPH on a mg/kg body weight basis was approximately 10-fold less potent than AMPH and METH. However, the 10-fold lower potency was in large part due to lower plasma levels produced by MPH compared to either AMPH or METH.},

In a previous work, we showed that CB2 expression is a poor prognostic factor in colon cancer patients. Here we report that activation of CB2 with low doses of specific agonists induce cell proliferation and favor the acquisition of aggressive molecular features in colon cancer cells. We show that sub-micromolar concentrations of CB2-specific agonists, JWH-133 and HU-308, promote an increase in cell proliferation rate through the activation of AKT/PKB pathway in colon cancer in vitro and in vivo. AKT activation promotes GSK3β inhibition and thus, a more aggressive cell phenotype with the subsequent elevation of SNAIL levels, E-cadherin degradation and β-catenin delocalization from cell membrane. Taken together, our data show that CB2 activation with sub-micromolar doses of agonists, which could be more similar to endogenous levels of cannabinoids, promote colon cancer progression, implicating that CB2 could have a pro-tumorigenic endogenous role in colon cancer.},

Its anti-oxidant properties were evaluated by DPPH and FRAP scavenging assays. The cytotoxicity of β-caryophyllene was tested against seven human cancer cell lines. The corresponding selectivity index was determined by testing its cytotoxicity on normal cells. The effects of β-caryophyllene were studied on a series of in vitro antitumor-promoting assays using colon cancer cells. Results showed that β-caryophyllene demonstrated selective antibacterial activity against S. aureus (MIC 3 ± 1.0 µM) and more pronounced anti-fungal activity than kanamycin. β-Caryophyllene also displayed strong antioxidant effects. Additionally, β-caryophyllene exhibited selective anti-proliferative effects against colorectal cancer cells (IC50 19 µM). The results also showed that β-caryophyllene induces apoptosis via nuclear condensation and fragmentation pathways including disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Further, β-caryophyllene demonstrated potent inhibition against clonogenicity, migration, invasion and spheroid formation in colon cancer cells. These results prompt us to state that β-caryophyllene is the active principle responsible for the selective anticancer and antimicrobial activities of A. crassnia. β-Caryophyllene has great potential to be further developed as a promising chemotherapeutic agent against colorectal malignancies.},

(family: Polygonaceae), named Hongcao in China, is a Traditional Chinese Medicinal and has long been used for rheumatic arthralgia and rheumatoid arthritis. However, no pharmacological and mechanism study to confirm these clinic effects have been published. In this investigation, the anti-inflammatory, analgesic effects and representative active ingredient compounds of P. orientale have been studied. Methods: Dried small pieces of the stems and leaves of P. orientale were decocted with water and partitioned successively to obtain ethyl acetate and ethyl ether extract of P. orientale (POEa and POEe). Chemical compositions of them were analyzed by UPLC-Q-Exactive HRMS. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of POEa and POEe were evaluated using xylene induced ear edema, carrageenan induced paw edema, Freunds’ complete adjuvant induced arthritis, and formaldehyde induced pain in rat. Their mechanisms of anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects were also studied via assays of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and PGE2 in serum. Results: UPLC-Q-Exactive HRMS analysis showed that POEa and POEe mainly contained flavonoids including orientin, isoorientin, vitexin, luteolin, and quercetin. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory effects of POEa and POEe were evident in xylene induced ear edema. The paw edema in Freund’s complete adjuvant and carrageenan were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05, 0.01) inhibited by POEa (5, 7.5 g/kg). POEe (7.5 g/kg) was significantly (P {\textless} 0.05, 0.01) inhibited Freunds’ complete adjuvant induced paw edema and cotton pellet induced granuloma formation. Similarly, POEe significantly (P {\textless} 0.05, 0.01) inhibited the pain sensation in acetic acid induced writhing test. POEa (5, 7.5 g/kg) significantly (P {\textless} 0.05, 0.01) inhibited formaldehyde induced pain in both phases. POEa (7.5 g/kg) markedly ( P {\textless} 0.05) prolonged the latency period of hot plate test after 30 and 60 min. The concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and PGE2 were significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) decreased by POEa (3.75, 5 g/kg). Conclusion: POEa and POEe have anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, which was mainly relevant to the presence of flavonoids, including orientin, isoorientin, vitexin, luteolin, and quercetin. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of POEa may be to decrease the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and PGE2 in serum.},

	abstract = {Background \& Aims: During fibrosis hepatic stellate cells (HSC) undergo activation, proliferation and senescence but the regulation of these important processes is poorly understood. The adenosine A2A receptor (A2A) is known to be present on HSC, and its activation results in liver fibrosis. In this study, we tested if A2A has a role in the regulation of HSC proliferation, apoptosis, senescence, and the relevant molecular mechanism.Methods: The ability of adenosine to regulate p53 and Rb protein levels, proliferation, apoptosis and senescence was tested in the human HSC cell line LX-2 and rat primary HSC.Results: Adenosine receptor activation down-regulates p53 and Rb protein levels, increases BrdU incorporation and increases cell survival in LX-2 cells and in primary rat HSC. These effects of NECA were reproduced by an adenosine A2A receptor specific agonist (CGS21680) and blocked by a specific antagonist (ZM241385). By day twenty-one of culture primary rat HSC entered senescence and expressed ï�¢-gal which was significantly inhibited by NECA. Furthermore, NECA induced down regulation of p53 and Rb and Rac1, and decreased phosphorylation of p44-42 MAP Kinase in LX-2 cells and primary rat HSC. These effects were reproduced by the cAMP analog 8-Bromo-cAMP, and the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, and were blocked by PKA inhibitors.Conclusions: These results demonstrate that A2A receptor regulates a number of HSC fate decisions and induces greater HSC proliferation, reduces apoptosis and senescence by decreasing p53 and Rb through cAMP-PKA/Rac1/p38 MAPK pathway. This provides a mechanism for adenosine induced HSC regulation and liver fibrosis.},

We review the evidence that LDN may operate as a novel anti-inflammatory agent in the central nervous system, via action on microglial cells. These effects may be unique to low dosages of naltrexone and appear to be entirely independent from naltrexone’s better-known activity on opioid receptors. As a daily oral therapy, LDN is inexpensive and well-tolerated. Despite initial promise of efficacy, the use of LDN for chronic disorders is still highly experimental. Published trials have low sample sizes, and few replications have been performed. We cover the typical usage of LDN in clinical trials, caveats to using the medication, and recommendations for future research and clinical work. LDN may represent one of the first glial cell modulators to be used for the management of chronic pain disorders.},

This is the first complete mapping study in mice for micro-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors after chronic naltrexone exposure. Treatment with naltrexone clearly induced up-regulation of micro- (mean 80\%) and, to a lesser extent, delta-opioid receptors (mean 39\%). The up-regulation of micro- and delta-opioid receptors was evident throughout the brain, although there was variation in the percentage change across brain regions. In contrast, consistent up-regulation of kappa-opioid receptors was observed in cortical structures only and was not so marked as for micro- and delta-opioid receptors. In noncortical regions kappa-opioid receptor expression was unchanged.

Opposing to the acute effects, repeated administration of the KOR agonist, U-6593, potentiates both high-potassium and amphetamine induced DA release in the NAc, suggesting that repeated activation of KOR sensitizes mesolimbic dopaminergic neurotransmission. This study investigated the effect of repeated treatment with U-69593 on basal and stimulated DA and serotonin (5HT) extracellular levels in the rat mPFC. Rats were injected once daily with U-69593 (0.16-0.32 mg/kg) or vehicle for 4 days.

We found that hyperalgesia-inducing treatment with morphine resulted in downregulation of the K+-Cl− co-transporter KCC2, impairing Cl− homeostasis in rat spinal lamina l neurons. Restoring the anion equilibrium potential reversed the morphine-induced hyperalgesia without affecting tolerance. The hyperalgesia was also reversed by ablating spinal microglia. Morphine hyperalgesia, but not tolerance, required μ opioid receptor–dependent expression of P2X4 receptors (P2X4Rs) in microglia and μ-independent gating of the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by P2X4Rs. Blocking BDNF-TrkB signaling preserved Cl− homeostasis and reversed the hyperalgesia. Gene-targeted mice in which Bdnf was deleted from microglia did not develop hyperalgesia to morphine. However, neither morphine antinociception nor tolerance was affected in these mice. Our findings dissociate morphine-induced hyperalgesia from tolerance and suggest the microglia-to-neuron P2X4-BDNF-KCC2 pathway as a therapeutic target for preventing hyperalgesia without affecting morphine analgesia.},

	volume = {23},
	issn = {1671-4083},
	abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of pentadecapeptide BPC 157 on chronic exposure to amphetamine in rats, particularly the changes commonly referred in chronic amphetamine studies as tolerance (lesser grade of stereotyped behavior, without increased excitability) and reverse tolerance (ie, prominent stereotyped behavior and heightened startle response upon late amphetamine challenges).
METHODS: After initial application (initial single dose-regimen), amphetamine (10 mg/kg,ip) was given once daily till d 5 (continuous administration-regimen), and thereafter on d 8, 16, and 46 (intermittent administration regimen). Fo r stereotyped behavior and heightened startle response the observation period was 120 min after amphetamine application, and each animal was observed for 10 s in 5 min intervals. Pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (10 microg/kg or 10 ng/k g, ip) or saline (5.0 mL/kg, ip) were given only at the beginning of the experiment, simultaneously with the initial dose of amphetamine.
RESULTS: In relation to applied initial-single/continuous/intermittent amphetamine applications regimen, the control amphetamine rats throughout the experiment showed the changes in stereotyped behavior and heightened startle response, increment or decrement, commonly explained in chronic amphetamine studies as tolerance and reverse tolerance. After t he initial application of the amphetamine, the higher BPC 157 dosage apparently attenuated the stereotyped behavior, while the lower dosage of BPC 157 did not reach a statistical significance. Considering the forthcoming amphetamine challenges, in the rats initially treated with pentadecapeptide BPC 157, either 10 microg- or 10 ng-dose, at the time of the first application of amphetamine, the stereotyped behavior remains to be attenuated after all additional amphetamine challenges (on d 2-5, 8, 16, and 46). This attenuation was not limited to stereotyped behavior only. After the initial application of the amphetamine the heighten ed startle response was also apparently mitigated in rats receiving the BPC 157 dosage, either higher or lower. Later, confronted with the forthcoming amphetamine challenges, they showed apparently less abnormal excitability at all tested points.
CONCLUSION: In summary, gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (ie, both microg- and ng-BPC 157 regimens) attenuated chronic amphetamine disturbances. This effect was present throughout the observation period at a statistically significant level. Therefore, it seems that this gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 has a modulatory effect on dopamine system, and it could be used in chronic amphetamine disturbances.},

Participants were given measures of emotional functioning, marijuana use symptoms, and reward sensitivity during monitored abstinence.ResultsAll participants (n = 56) completed the protocol, and 69\% of marijuana users (n = 18 of 26) were confirmed abstinent for 28 days, with all users showing decreasing marijuana use. Reductions in subsyndromal depression, positive marijuana use expectancies, and poor sleep quality were observed by the end of the monitored abstinence period (n = 26, p values {\textless} .05). Marijuana users also reported more attentional impulsivity and less responsiveness to reward stimuli during the second week of abstinence compared to controls. Later age of onset of regular marijuana use and more cumulative lifetime use were associated with a greater degree of emotional change and increased recognition of the negative effects of marijuana use.ConclusionsMonitored abstinence programs may be beneficial in reducing marijuana use, subsyndromal emotional distress symptoms, and changing beliefs about marijuana use.

Trauma-focused psychotherapies are more likely than drug treatment to achieve PTSD remission, but have high dropout rates and ineffective for a large percentage of patients. Therefore, research into drugs that might increase the effectiveness of psychotherapy is a logical avenue of investigation. The most promising drug studied as a catalyst to psychotherapy for PTSD thus far is 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as the recreational drug “Ecstasy.” MDMA stimulates the release of hormones and neurochemicals that affect key brain areas for emotion and memory processing. A series of recently completed phase 2 clinical trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD show favorable safety outcomes and large effect sizes that warrant expansion into multi-site phase 3 trials, set to commence in 2018. The nonprofit sponsor of the MDMA drug development program, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), is supporting these trials to explore whether MDMA, administered on only a few occasions, can increase the effectiveness of psychotherapy. Brain imaging techniques and animal models of fear extinction are elucidating neural mechanisms underlying the robust effects of MDMA on psychological processing; however, much remains to be learned about the complexities of MDMA effects as well as the complexities of PTSD itself.},

The present study is the first to examine the impact of both task difficulty and alcohol consumption on IB and primary task performance.ObjectivesOn the basis of alcohol myopia theory, the combined effects of increased task difficulty and alcohol intoxication were predicted to impair task performance and restrict the focus of attention on to task-relevant stimuli. We therefore expected increases in breath alcohol concentration to be associated with poorer primary task performance and higher rates of IB, with these relationships being stronger under hard than easy task conditions.MethodsThis hypothesis was tested in a field study where alcohol drinkers in a local bar were randomly assigned to perform a dynamic IB task with an easy or hard visual tracking and counting task at its core (Simons and Chabris in Perception 28:1059–1074, 1999).ResultsIncreasing the difficulty of the primary task reduced task accuracy but, surprisingly, had no impact on the rate of IB. Higher levels of alcohol intoxication were, however, associated with poorer task performance and an increased rate of IB, but only under easy primary task conditions.ConclusionsResults are consistent with alcohol myopia theory. Alcohol intoxication depletes attentional resources, thus reducing the drinker’s awareness of salient stimuli that are irrelevant to some ongoing primary task. We conclude that this effect was not observed for our hard task because it is more resource intensive, so leaves no spare attentional capacity for alcohol to deplete.},

Antioxidants may offer therapeutic benefits.ObjectivesThe objective of this study is to investigate N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) as a therapeutic antioxidant to reverse schizophrenia-like bio-behavioural changes in rats exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), adolescent methamphetamine (MA) or a combination thereof.MethodsSprague-Dawley offspring prenatally exposed to saline/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) received saline or MA (0.2–6 mg kg−1 twice daily × 16 days) during adolescence and divided into LPS, MA and LPS + MA groups. Vehicle/NAC (150 mg kg−1 × 14 days) was administered following MA/saline exposure on postnatal day 51–64. Social interaction, novel object recognition and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle, as well as regional brain monoamines, lipid peroxidation, plasma reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α; IL-10), were assessed.ResultsNAC reversed LPS, MA and LPS + MA-induced anxiety-like social withdrawal behaviours, as well as MA and LPS + MA-induced deficits in recognition memory. PPI deficits were evident in MA, LPS and LPS + MA models, with NAC reversing that following LPS + MA. NAC reversed LPS, MA and LPS + MA-induced frontal cortical dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) elevations, LPS and LPS + MA-induced frontal cortical 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), serotonin (5-HT) and striatal NA deficits as well as LPS + MA-induced frontal cortical 5-HT turnover. Decreased IL-10 in the LPS, MA and LPS + MA animals, and increased TNF-α in the LPS and MA animals, was reversed with NAC. NAC also reversed elevated lipid peroxidation and ROS in the LPS and LPS + MA animals.ConclusionsPrenatal LPS, LPS + postnatal MA challenge during adolescence, and to a lesser extent MA alone, promotes schizophrenia-like bio-behavioural changes later in life that are reversed by NAC, emphasizing therapeutic potential for schizophrenia and MA-associated psychosis. The nature and timing of the dual-hit are critical.},

	abstract = {RationaleRecent studies have shown that cannabis may disrupt glutamate (Glu) signaling depressing Glu tone in frequent users. Current evidence have also consistently reported lower Glu-levels in various brain regions, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of chronic schizophrenia patients, while findings in early psychosis (EP) are not conclusive. Since cannabis may alter Glu synaptic plasticity and its use is a known risk factor for psychosis, studies focusing on Glu signaling in EP with or without a concomitant cannabis-usage seem crucial.ObjectiveWe investigate the effect of cannabis use on prefrontal Glu-levels in EP users vs. both EP non-users and healthy controls (HC).MethodsMagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure [GlumPFC] of 35 EP subjects (18 of whom were cannabis users) and 33 HC. For correlative analysis, neuropsychological performances were scored by the MATRICS-consensus cognitive battery.Results[GlumPFC] was lower in EP users comparing to both HC and EP non-users (p {\textless} 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively), while no differences were observed between EP non-users and HC. A greater [GlumPFC]-decline with age was observed in EP users (r = âˆ’.46; p = 0.04), but not in EP non-users or HC. Among neuropsychological outcomes, working memory was the only domain that differentiates patients depending on their cannabis use, with users having poorer performances.ConclusionsCannabis use is associated with reduced prefrontal [GlumPFC] and with a stronger Glu-levels decline with age. Glutamatergic abnormalities might influence the cognitive impairment observed in users and have some relevance for the progression of the disease.},

Little is known about the underlying behavioral mechanisms associated with this increased risk, particularly at the adolescent stage.ObjectiveThis study aimed to assess the effects of overnight nicotine abstinence and smoking reinstatement on subjective withdrawal states in adolescent smokers with and without ADHD.MethodsAdolescent daily smokers (27 with ADHD and 17 without ADHD) completed three experimental sessions: (1) a placebo patch followed by smoking a nicotine cigarette, (2) placebo patch followed by smoking a nicotine-free cigarette, and (3) nicotine patch followed by smoking a nicotine-free cigarette. Subjects abstained overnight before each session, and patches were administered 45 min before smoking. The primary outcome measure was a smoking withdrawal symptom questionnaire.ResultsADHD smokers experienced greater difficulty concentrating and impatience/restlessness during abstinence than non-ADHD smokers. Smoking a cigarette improved abstinence-induced difficulty concentrating and restlessness, regardless of its nicotine content, and regardless of whether transdermal nicotine was received or not.ConclusionsThus, sensorimotor aspects of smoking, rather than nicotine itself, appeared to relieve withdrawal. Although ADHD smokers report greater withdrawal symptoms than non-ADHD smokers, they responded strongly to the sensorimotor aspects of smoking during withdrawal. These findings suggest that even lighter, adolescent smokers with ADHD are vulnerable to smoking progression through altered smoking abstinence and withdrawal relief processes.},

	abstract = {Rationale3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) persistently improves symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when combined with psychotherapy. Studies in rodents suggest that these effects can be attributed to enhancement of fear memory extinction. Therefore, MDMA may improve the effects of exposure-based therapy for PTSD, particularly in treatment-resistant patients. However, given MDMA’s broad pharmacological profile, further investigation is warranted before moving to a complex clinical population.ObjectivesWe aimed to inform clinical research by providing a translational model of MDMA’s effect, and elucidating monoaminergic mechanisms through which MDMA enhances fear extinction.MethodsWe explored the importance of monoamine transporters targeted by MDMA to fear memory extinction, as measured by reductions in conditioned freezing and fear-potentiated startle (FPS) in mice. Mice were treated with selective inhibitors of individual monoamine transporters prior to combined MDMA treatment and fear extinction training.ResultsMDMA enhanced the lasting extinction of FPS. Acute and chronic treatment with a 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) inhibitor blocked MDMA’s effect on fear memory extinction. Acute inhibition of dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) transporters had no effect. 5-HT release alone did not enhance extinction. Blockade of MDMA’s effect by 5-HTT inhibition also downregulated 5-HT2A-mediated behavior, and 5-HT2A antagonism disrupted MDMA’s effect on extinction.ConclusionsWe validate enhancement of fear memory extinction by MDMA in a translational behavioral model, and reveal the importance of 5-HTT and 5-HT2A receptors to this effect. These observations support future clinical research of MDMA as an adjunct to exposure therapy, and provide important pharmacological considerations for clinical use in a population frequently treated with 5-HTT inhibitors.},

	abstract = {In the mammalian pineal gland, the rhythm in melatonin biosynthesis depends on the norepinephrine (NE)-driven regulation of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT), the penultimate enzyme of melatonin biosynthesis. A recent study showed that phytocannabinoids like tetrahydrocannabinol reduce AANAT activity and attenuate NE-induced melatonin biosynthesis in rat pineal glands, raising the possibility that an endocannabinoid system is present in the pineal gland. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed cannabinoid (CB) receptors and specific enzymes for endocannabinoid biosynthesis or catabolism in rat pineal glands and cultured pinealocytes. Immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses revealed the presence of CB1 and CB2 receptor proteins, of N-acyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine hydrolyzing phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), an enzyme catalyzing endocannabinoid biosynthesis and of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), an endocannabinoid catabolizing enzyme, in pinealocytes, and in pineal sympathetic nerve fibers identified by double immunofluorescence with an antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase. The immunosignals for the CB2 receptor, NAPE-PLD, and FAAH found in pinealocytes did not vary under a 12 hr light:12 hr dark cycle. The CB1 receptor immunoreaction in pinealocytes was significantly reduced at the end of the light phase [zeitgeber time (ZT) 12]. The immunosignal for NAPE-PLD found in pineal sympathetic nerve fibers was reduced in the middle of the dark phase (ZT 18). Stimulation of cultured pinealocytes with NE affected neither the subcellular distribution nor the intensity of the immunosignals for the investigated CB receptors and enzymes. In summary, the pineal gland comprises indispensable compounds of the endocannabinoid system indicating that endocannabinoids may be involved in the control of pineal physiology.},

Significant dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effects (95.6 ± 3.1\% inhibition of inflammatory pain at 2.5 mg/kg ip and 50.0 ± 15.9\% inhibition of edema formation at 5 mg/kg ip) and acute analgesia (66.1 ± 28.1\% inhibition at 5.0 mg/kg ip) were observed. Moreover, guineensine inhibited proinflammatory cytokine production in endotoxemia. Intriguingly, guineensine and LPS independently induced catalepsy, but in combination this effect was abolished. Both hypothermia and analgesia were blocked by the CB1 receptor inverse agonist rimonabant, but the pronounced hypolocomotion was CB1 receptor-independent. A subsequent screen of 45 CNS-related receptors, ion channels, and transporters revealed apparent interactions of guineensine with the dopamine transporter DAT, 5HT2A, and sigma receptors, uncovering its prospective polypharmacology.

	abstract = {Intracranial/intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a leading cause of death and disability in people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke. No proven drug is available for ICH. Panax notoginseng (total saponin extraction, PNS) is one of the most valuable herb medicines for stroke and cerebralvascular disorders in China. We searched for randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) involving PNS injection to treat cerebral hemorrhage for meta-analysis from various databases including the Chinese Stroke Trials Register, the trials register of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Chinese BioMedical disk, and China Doctorate/Master Dissertations Databases. The quality of the eligible trials was assessed by Jadadâ€™s scale. Twenty (20) of the 24 identified randomized controlled trials matched the inclusive criteria including 984 ICH patients with PNS injection and 907 ICH patients with current treatment (CT). Compared to the CT groups, PNS-treated patients showed better outcomes in the effectiveness rate (ER), neurological deficit score, intracranial hematoma volume, intracerebral edema volume, Barthel index, the number of patients died, and incidence of adverse events. Conclusion: PNS injection is superior to CT for acute ICH. A review of the literature shows that PNS may exert multiple protective mechanisms against ICH-induced brain damage including hemostasis, anti-coagulation, anti-thromboembolism, cerebral vasodilation, invigorated blood dynamics, anti-inflammation, antioxidation, and anti-hyperglycemic effects. Since vitamin C and other brain cell activators (BCA) that are not considered common practice were also used as parts of the CT in several trials, potential PNS and BCA interactions could exist that may have made the effect of PNS therapy less or more impressive than by PNS therapy alone. Future PNS trials with and without the inclusion of such controversial BCAs as part of the CT could clarify the situation. As PNS has a long clinical track record in Asia, it could potentially become a therapy option to treat ICH in the US and Europe. Further clinical trials with better experimental design could determine the long-term effects of PNS treatment for TBI and stroke.},

	abstract = {Sciatic nerve injury is commonly seen in clinical practice predominantly associated with trauma or sports injuries. Recent studies indicated that ginsenoside Rg1 (Gs Rg1), extracted from Chinese herbs, was found to promote regeneration of injured rat sciatic nerve and that nerve growth factor (NGF) may be involved in this process. The aim of this study was to examine the role that NGF may play in ginsenoside Rg1-induced regeneration of rat sciatic nerve following injury. Animals following surgical right sciatic nerve injury were subsequently administered intraperitoneally either saline (sham control) or different doses of 2, 4, 8, or 12 mg/kg daily GsRg1 for 2 to 8 wk. In addition, 100 Î¼g/kg mecobalamin, a drug utilized to treat nerve injuries, was employed as a positive control. After 2, 4, or 8 wk, sciatic functional index (SFI) and mean nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), markers of sciatic nerve function, were assessed to determine whether recovery of injured sciatic nerve occurred. In addition, immunohistochemistry and Western blot methods were used to examine NGF protein expression changes. Results showed that all doses of GsRg1 significantly increased SFI and MNCV in injured sciatic-nerve-damaged rats in a manner similar to that noted with mecobalamin. It is of interest that the intermediate 4- and 8-mg/kg doses were more effective in restoring nerve functions. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot results also demonstrated a similar pattern with enhanced NGF protein expression at all doses, but greater effects were noted at 4 and 8 mg/kg GsRg1. Data suggest that GsRg1 promotes recovery of injured sciatic nerve functions within a specific dose range and that NGF may be involved in this physiological process.},

	abstract = {Red ginseng and its active ingredients have been shown to decrease neuron death after brain ischemia in experimental animals. However, little is known about the effects of orally administered ginseng extract on spinal cord injury. We orally gave red ginseng extract (RGE) to rats with compressed spinal cord injury (SCI). Open-field locomotor scores were measured as indices of motor function. Histopathological changes and cytokine expressions in situ after SCI were evaluated. Compared to vehicle treatment, RGE treatment (350 mg/kg/day) significantly improved locomotor score up to levels close to those pre-SCI, prevented neuron loss, and facilitated the restoration of white matter in the spinal cord at 14 days after SCI. Treatment with RGE caused less aggregation of Iba-1-positive microglia in grey and white matter at 7 days after SCI, upregulated the expression levels of VEGF and Bcl-xL, and reduced IL-1β and TNFα expressions in the spinal cord at 7 and 14 days after SCI. We concluded that oral administration of RGE facilitates almost complete functional recovery from motor and behavioral abnormalities in rats with SCI and prevents neuron death in situ, possibly through inhibition of inflammation and upregulation of neuroprotective factors in the injured spinal cord.},

	abstract = {The putative cannabinoid receptor GPR55 has been shown to play a tumor-promoting role in various cancers, and is involved in many physiological and pathological processes of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. While the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1 ) has been reported to suppress intestinal tumor growth, the role of GPR55 in the development of GI cancers is unclear. We, therefore, aimed at elucidating the role of GPR55 in colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most common cancer worldwide. Using azoxymethane (AOM)- and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-driven CRC mouse models, we found that GPR55 plays a tumor-promoting role that involves alterations of leukocyte populations, i.e. myeloid-derived suppressor cells and T lymphocytes, within the tumor tissues. Concomitantly, expression levels of COX-2 and STAT3 were reduced in tumor tissue of GPR55 knockout mice, indicating reduced presence of tumor-promoting factors. By employing the experimental CRC models to CB1 knockout and CB1 /GPR55 double knockout mice, we can further show that GPR55 plays an opposing role to CB1 . We report that GPR55 and CB1 mRNA expression are differentially regulated in the experimental models and in a cohort of 86 CRC patients. Epigenetic methylation of CNR1 and GPR55 was also differentially regulated in human CRC tissue compared to control samples. Collectively, our data suggest that GPR55 and CB1 play differential roles in colon carcinogenesis where the former seems to act as oncogene and the latter as tumor suppressor.},

	abstract = {In recent years the “dopamine (DA) hypothesis of schizophrenia”, has been modified into a more diversified view where an attenuated glutamatergic neurotransmission is believed to participate in the pathogenesis of the disease. Thus, schizophrenia may be regarded as a glutamate deficiency disorder. Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an endogenous glutamate antagonist with a preferential action at the glycine-site of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) -receptor. Mounting evidence indicates that the compound is significantly involved in basal neurophysiological processes in the brain. Thus, in anaesthetized rats, pharmacologically elevated KYNA concentration (by means of PNU 156561A) was associated with increased firing rate and burst firing activity of midbrain DA neurons. Similar alterations in basal firing characteristics are also observed following systemic administration of PCP or ketamine, indicating per se that elevated levels of brain KYNA is associated with psychotomimetic effects. Indeed, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) level of kynurenic acid was elevated in 28 male first episode schizophrenic patients (1.67 ¡À0.27 nM) as compared to 17 male healthy controls (0.97 ¡À0.07 nM. Elevated brain KYNA concentration was also found to dramatically affect the responsivity of rat midbrain DA neurons to the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine. Thus, whereas clozapine produced increased firing rate and burst firing activity of these neurons in untreated rats, elevation of brain KYNA levels was found to reverse the action of clozapine into a pure inhibitory response. The present study suggests a contribution of KYNA in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and link the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia together with the idea of a deficiency of glutamate function in this disease.},

	abstract = {The effect of dopamine (1 micrograms/kg/min by i.v. infusion) on corticosteroid levels was studied in five patients with cortisol excess caused by increased ACTH secretion. In four of the five subjects dopamine, when compared with placebo infusion, caused plasma concentrations of 11-deoxycorticosterone to rise without affecting levels of cortisol, corticosterone or aldosterone. In a parallel in-vitro study using incubations of bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa cells, dopamine (10(-9) mol/l-10(-5) mol/l) had no effect on basal or ACTH stimulated secretion of aldosterone, cortisol or 11-deoxycorticosterone. However, dopamine (10(-5) mol/l) partially inhibited angiotensin II (10(-7) mol/l) stimulated secretion of aldosterone (4.36 ng/10(6) cells/h +/- 0.28 vs 2.90 +/- 0.20, P less than 0.05) but did not alter 11-deoxycorticosterone secretion i the same incubations. these data suggest that the effect of dopamine on 11-deoxycorticosterone secretion in vivo may not be due to its direct action on the adrenal to inhibit corticosteroidogenesis. An alternative explanation is that dopamine may alter extra-adrenal synthesis of 11-deoxycorticosterone, possibly by increasing substrate availability to tissues capable of 21-hydroxylation reactions.},

	abstract = {Phenibut is clinically used anxiolytic, mood elevator and nootropic drug. R-phenibut is responsible for the pharmacological activity of racemic phenibut, and this activity correlates with its binding affinity for GABAB receptors. In contrast, S-phenibut does not bind to GABAB receptors. In this study, we assessed the binding affinities of R-phenibut, S-phenibut, baclofen and gabapentin (GBP) for the α2-δ subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) using a subunit-selective ligand, radiolabelled GBP. Binding experiments using rat brain membrane preparations revealed that the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kis) for R-phenibut, S-phenibut, baclofen and GBP were 23, 39, 156 and 0.05μM, respectively. In the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure test, we found that at doses up to 100mg/kg, R-phenibut did not affect PTZ-induced seizures. The anti-nociceptive effects of R-phenibut were assessed using the formalin-induced paw-licking test and the chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve model. Pre-treatment with R-phenibut dose-dependently decreased the nociceptive response during both phases of the test. The anti-nociceptive effects of R-phenibut in the formalin-induced paw-licking test were not blocked by the GABAB receptor-selective antagonist CGP35348. In addition, treatment with R- and S-phenibut alleviated the mechanical and thermal allodynia induced by CCI of the sciatic nerve. Our data suggest that the binding affinity of R-phenibut for the α2-δ subunit of the VDCC is 4 times higher than its affinity for the GABAB receptor. The anti-nociceptive effects of R-phenibut observed in the tests of formalin-induced paw licking and CCI of the sciatic nerve were associated with its effect on the α2-δ subunit of the VDCC rather than with its effects on GABAB receptors. In conclusion, our results provide experimental evidence for GBP-like, anti-nociceptive properties of R-phenibut, which might be used clinically to treat neuropathic pain disorders.},

In this review, we summarize the extant results on the origin and evolution of GABA and glutamate, as well as their receptors, and analyze possible evolutionary processes and phylogenetic relationships of various GABAs and glutamate receptors. We further discuss the evolutionary history of Excitatory/Neutral Amino Acid Transporter (EAAT), a transport protein, which plays an important role in the GABA-glutamate "yin and yang" balanced regulation. Finally, based on current advances, we propose several potential directions of future research.},

Homocysteine can be re-methylated to methionine [precursor of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)] via the re-methylation or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate pathway or undergoes transsulfuration to form cysteine by the action of metabolic enzymes and cofactors. Impaired metabolism due to genetic alteration in metabolic enzymes (methionine synthase, methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), cystathionine β-synthase (CβS), and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CγL) or deficiency in cofactors (vitamin B6 , B12 , folate) may lead to acquired metabolic anomaly known as hyperhomocysteinemia. Hcy excess decreases the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent synthesis of catecholamines, viz. dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and noncatecholamine, viz. serotonin (5-HT), due to genetic alteration in key enzyme MTHFR in the homocysteine metabolism pathway that leads to depression. Thus, hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-induced SAM level is influenced by the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) MTHFR C677T. Furthermore, HHcy leads to production of precarious neurotoxic product homocysteic acid (HCA) and cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA) which acts as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist and has neurotoxic effects on dopaminergic neurons. In the current review, an attempt has been made to discuss the neurotoxic effects of HHcy in the pathogenesis of depression.},

For years, it was assumed that stimulants had paradoxical calming effects in ADHD patients, whereas stimulating ‘normal’ individuals and producing locomotor activation in rats. It is now known that low doses of stimulants focus attention and improve executive function in both normal and ADHD subjects. Furthermore, the seminal work of Kuczenski and Segal showed that low, oral doses of methylphenidate reduce locomotor activity in rats as well. Berridge et al have now shown that these low doses produce marked increases in norepinephrine and dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, whereas having only subtle effects on subcortical catecholamine release. ihe prefrontal cortex regulates behavior and attention using representational knowledge, and imaging and neuropsychological studies have shown that the prefrontal cortex is weaker in subjects with ADHD. This cortical area is very sensitive to levels of catecholamines: moderate levels engage postsynaptic α2A-adrenoceptors and D1 receptors and improve prefrontal regulation of behavior and attention, while high levels impair prefrontal function via α1-adrenoceptors and excessive D1 receptor stimulation. Administering low doses of methylphenidate to rats improves the working memory and attentional functions of the prefrontal cortex, while high doses impair working memory and produce a perseverative pattern of errors similar to that seen in patients. The low dose improvement is hiocked by either an α2-adrenoceptor or Dl receptor antagonist, suggesting that both norepinephrine and dopamine contribute to the beneficial actions of stimulant medications.},

	abstract = {Spinal cord injury is a major cause of disability and results in many serious physical, psychological, and social difficulties. Numerous studies have shown that traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCI) lead to neuronal loss and axonal degeneration in and around the injury site that cause partial disability or complete paralysis. An important strategy in the treatment of SCI is to promote neuron survival and axon outgrowth, making possible the recovery of neural connections. Using an in vitro survival assay, we have identified ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1, extracted from ginseng root (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer), as efficient neuroprotective agents for spinal cord neurons. These compounds protect spinal neurons from excitotoxicity induced by glutamate and kainic acid, as well as oxidative stress induced by H(2)O(2). The neuroprotective effects are dose-dependent. The optimal doses are 20-40 microM for ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1. The effects are specific for Rb1 and Rg1, since a third ginsenoside, Re, did not exhibit any activity. Ginseng has been used for thousands of years in the treatment of neurological disorders and other diseases in Asia. Ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1 represent potentially effective therapeutic agents for spinal cord injuries.},

	abstract = {Sciatic nerve injury is commonly seen in clinical practice predominantly associated with trauma or sports injuries. Recent studies indicated that ginsenoside Rg1 (Gs Rg1), extracted from Chinese herbs, was found to promote regeneration of injured rat sciatic nerve and that nerve growth factor (NGF) may be involved in this process. The aim of this study was to examine the role that NGF may play in ginsenoside Rg1-induced regeneration of rat sciatic nerve following injury. Animals following surgical right sciatic nerve injury were subsequently administered intraperitoneally either saline (sham control) or different doses of 2, 4, 8, or 12 mg/kg daily GsRg1 for 2 to 8 wk. In addition, 100 Î¼g/kg mecobalamin, a drug utilized to treat nerve injuries, was employed as a positive control. After 2, 4, or 8 wk, sciatic functional index (SFI) and mean nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), markers of sciatic nerve function, were assessed to determine whether recovery of injured sciatic nerve occurred. In addition, immunohistochemistry and Western blot methods were used to examine NGF protein expression changes. Results showed that all doses of GsRg1 significantly increased SFI and MNCV in injured sciatic-nerve-damaged rats in a manner similar to that noted with mecobalamin. It is of interest that the intermediate 4- and 8-mg/kg doses were more effective in restoring nerve functions. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot results also demonstrated a similar pattern with enhanced NGF protein expression at all doses, but greater effects were noted at 4 and 8 mg/kg GsRg1. Data suggest that GsRg1 promotes recovery of injured sciatic nerve functions within a specific dose range and that NGF may be involved in this physiological process.},

	abstract = {When infants and adults communicate, they exchange social signals of availability and communicative intention such as eye gaze. Previous research indicates that when communication is successful, close temporal dependencies arise between adult speakers’ and listeners’ neural activity. However, it is not known whether similar neural contingencies exist within adult–infant dyads. Here, we used dual-electroencephalography to assess whether direct gaze increases neural coupling between adults and infants during screen-based and live interactions. In experiment 1 (n = 17), infants viewed videos of an adult who was singing nursery rhymes with (i) direct gaze (looking forward), (ii) indirect gaze (head and eyes averted by 20°), or (iii) direct-oblique gaze (head averted but eyes orientated forward). In experiment 2 (n = 19), infants viewed the same adult in a live context, singing with direct or indirect gaze. Gaze-related changes in adult–infant neural network connectivity were measured using partial directed coherence. Across both experiments, the adult had a significant (Granger) causal influence on infants’ neural activity, which was stronger during direct and direct-oblique gaze relative to indirect gaze. During live interactions, infants also influenced the adult more during direct than indirect gaze. Further, infants vocalized more frequently during live direct gaze, and individual infants who vocalized longer also elicited stronger synchronization from the adult. These results demonstrate that direct gaze strengthens bidirectional adult–infant neural connectivity during communication. Thus, ostensive social signals could act to bring brains into mutual temporal alignment, creating a joint-networked state that is structured to facilitate information transfer during early communication and learning.},

	abstract = {Rationale
Social play behavior is a characteristic form of social behavior displayed by juvenile and adolescent mammals. This social play behavior is highly rewarding, and of major importance for social and cognitive development. Social play is known to be modulated by neurotransmitter systems involved in reward and motivation. Interestingly, psychostimulant drugs, such as amphetamine and cocaine, profoundly suppress social play, but the neural mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be elucidated.

Objective
In this study we investigated the pharmacological underpinnings of amphetamine- and cocaine-induced suppression of social play behavior in rats.

Results
The play-suppressant effects of amphetamine were antagonized by the alpha-2 adrenoreceptor antagonist RX821002 but not by the dopamine receptor antagonist alpha-flupenthixol. Remarkably, the effects of cocaine on social play were not antagonized by alpha-2 noradrenergic, dopaminergic or serotonergic receptor antagonists, administered either alone or in combination. The effects of a subeffective dose of cocaine were enhanced by a combination of subeffective doses of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, the dopamine reuptake inhibitor GBR12909 and the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine.

Conclusions
Amphetamine, like methylphenidate, exerts its play-suppressant effect through alpha-2 noradrenergic receptors. On the other hand, cocaine reduces social play by simultaneous increases in dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin neurotransmission. In conclusion, psychostimulant drugs with different pharmacological profiles suppress social play behavior through distinct mechanisms. These data contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanisms of social behavior during an important developmental period, and of the deleterious effects of psychostimulant exposure thereon.},

Over the same exposure period, cocaine neither impaired neuronal function nor altered dopamine cell survival. To test whether a longer exposure period to cocaine would alter dopamine function, we added cocaine (100 microM) to the cultures once daily for either 8 or 11 days and examined changes in dopamine uptake, cell survival and morphology 24 h after the last administration.

CASE REPORT: A 44-year-old female with history of cocaine and alcohol abuse presented with massive stroke in the emergency department. CT scan revealed extensive left internal carotid artery dissection extending into the left middle and anterior cerebral arteries resulting in a massive left hemispheric infarct, requiring urgent decompressive craniectomy. The patient had a stormy hospital course with multiple episodes of torsades de pointes in the first 4 days requiring aggressive management. She survived all events and was discharged to a nursing home with residual right hemiplegia and aphasia.
CONCLUSION: The combination of ethanol and cocaine has been associated with a significant increase in the incidence of neurological and cardiac emergencies including cerebral infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrhythmias. The alteration of cocaine pharmacokinetics and the formation of cocaethylene have been implicated, at least partially, in the increased toxicity of this drug combination.},

	abstract = {Preconditioning has emerged as a valid strategy against different neurotoxic insults. Although the mechanisms underlying preconditioning are not fully understood, the activation of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels has been proposed to play a pivotal role in neuronal preconditioning. In the present work we examine whether minoxidil a KATP channel activator protects against the long-term toxicity caused by the amphetamine derivative 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in rats. Our data show that intrastriatal administration of minoxidil prevents MDMA-induced long-term indole depletions in the rat striatum. This effect was not related to an effect on core temperature, as pre-treatment with minoxidil did not significantly alter MDMA-induced hyperthermia. Taking into account that minoxidil opens both sarcolemmal and mitochondrial KATP channels, we examined the role of each type of channels in the protective effects of minoxidil using specific inhibitors. The administration of HMR-1098, a blocker of the sarcolemmal KATP channels, along with minoxidil did not affect the protection afforded by the latter. On the contrary the selective mitochondrial KATP channel blocker 5-hydroxydecanoic acid completely reversed the protection afforded by minoxidil, thereby implicating the involvement of mitochondrial (but not sarcolemmal) KATP channels. Furthermore our data show the participation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinases in minoxidil-afforded protection. Intrastriatal administration of wortmannin or PD98059 (inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated protein kinase, respectively), along with minoxidil abolished the protective effect of minoxidil against the serotonergic toxicity caused by MDMA. These results demonstrate that minoxidil by opening mitochondrial KATP channels completely prevents MDMA toxicity and that Akt and MAP kinases are involved in minoxidil-afforded neuroprotection.},

In this sense salvinorin A (SA), the main diterpene of the medicinal plant Salvia divinorum is an important antinociceptive compound, which acts as a potent agonist of kappa opioid receptor (KOR) and cannabinoid CB1 receptors.
METHODS: We evaluated nociceptive responses in a neuropathic pain model induced by the sciatic nerve ligature (SNL) in the right hind paw, after the microinjection of SA, Salvinorin B (SB), KOR and CB1 antagonists directly in the insular cortex (IC) in male wistar rats.
RESULTS: We found a potent antinociceptive effect with the administration of SA. Moreover, this effect was blocked by the administration of a KOR antagonist as well as the administration of a CB1 antagonist.
CONCLUSION: Salvinorin A has a potent antinociceptive effect when is administered centrally in the IC by the interaction with KOR and CB1 receptors.
SIGNIFICANCE: We show evidence on the effectiveness of the administration of salvinorin A in the IC in a rodent model of neuropathic pain. These results support the use of novel compounds like SA as a therapeutic alternative for neuropathic pain relief.},

	abstract = {Background: Increased locomotor activity in response to the same stimulus is an index of behavioral sensitization observed in preclinical models of drug addiction and compulsive behaviors. Repeated administration of quinpirole, a D2/D3 dopamine agonist, induces locomotor sensitization. This effect is potentiated and accelerated by co-administration of U69593, a kappa opioid receptor agonist. The mechanism underlying kappa opioid receptor potentiation of quinpirole-induced locomotor sensitization remains to be elucidated.
Methods: Immunofluorescence anatomical studies were undertaken in mice brain slices and rat presynaptic synaptosomes to reveal kappa opioid receptor and D2R pre- and postsynaptic colocalization in the nucleus accumbens. Tonic and phasic dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens of rats repeatedly treated with U69593 and quinpirole was assessed by microdialysis and fast scan cyclic voltammetry.
Results: Anatomical data show that kappa opioid receptor and D2R colocalize postsynaptically in medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens and the highest presynaptic colocalization occurs on the same dopamine terminals. Significantly reduced dopamine levels were observed in quinpirole, and U69593-quinpirole treated rats, explaining sensitization of D2R. Presynaptic inhibition induced by kappa opioid receptor and D2R of electrically evoked dopamine release was faster in U69593-quinpirole compared with quinpirole-repeatedly treated rats.
Conclusions: Pre- and postsynaptic colocalization of kappa opioid receptor and D2R supports a role for kappa opioid receptor potentiating both the D2R inhibitory autoreceptor function and the inhibitory action of D2R on efferent medium spiny neurons. Kappa opioid receptor co-activation accelerates D2R sensitization by contributing to decrease dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens.},

	abstract = {Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) is widely distributed in the central nervous system, in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and in astrocytes. CB1R agonists impair cognition and prevent long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission, but the inﬂuence of endogenously formed cannabinoids (eCBs) on hippocampal LTP remains ambiguous. Based on the knowledge that eCBs are released upon high frequency neuronal firing, we hypothesized that the influence of eCBs upon LTP could change according to the paradigm of LTP induction. We thus tested the influence of eCBs on hippocampal LTP using two θ -burst protocols that induce either a weak or a strong LTP. LTP induced by a weak-θ-Burstburst protocol is facilitated while preventing the endogenous activation of CB1Rs. In contrast, the same procedures lead to inhibition of LTP induced by the Strongstrong-θ-Burstburst protocol, suggestive of a facilitatory action of eCBs upon strong LTP. Accordingly, an inhibitor of the metabolism of the predominant eCB in the hippocampus, 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), facilitates strong LTP. The facilitatory action of endogenous CB1R activation does not require the activity of inhibitory A1 adenosine receptors, is not affected by inhibition of astrocytic metabolism, but involves inhibitory GABAergic transmission. The continuous activation of CB1Rs via exogenous cannabinoids, or by drugs known to prevent metabolism of the non-prevalent hippocampal eCB, anandamide, inhibited LTP. We conclude that endogenous activation of CB1Rs by physiologically formed eCBs exert a fine-tune homeostatic control of LTP in the hippocampus, acting as a high-pass filter, therefore likely reducing the signal to noise ratio of synaptic strengthening.},

However, there is growing evidence that the oxytocin (OT)/vasopressin system can modulate some the effects of MDMA. In this study, MDMA (2.5–10 mg/kg), DOB (0.5 mg/kg), or PMA (0.005, 0.1, or 0.25 mg/kg) were administered intramuscularly to adult zebra fish, alone or in combination with the V1a vasopressin antagonist, SR49059 (0.01–1 ng/kg), before carrying out conditioned place preference (CPP), social preference, novel tank diving, and light–dark tests in order to evaluate subsequent rewarding, social, and emotional-like behavior. The combination of SR49059 and each drug progressively blocked: (1) rewarding behavior as measured by CPP in terms of time spent in drug-paired compartment; (2) prosocial effects measured on the basis of the time spent in the proximity of a nacre fish picture; and (3) anxiolytic effects in terms of the time spent in the upper half of the novel tank and in the white compartment of the tank used for the light–dark test. Antagonism was obtained at SR49059 doses which, when given alone, did not change motor function. In comparison with a control group, receiving vehicle alone, there was a three to five times increase in the brain release of isotocin (the analog of OT in fish) after treatment with the most active doses of MDMA (10 mg/kg), DOB (0.5 mg/kg), and PMA (0.1 mg/kg) as evaluated by means of bioanalytical reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Taken together, these findings show that the OT/vasopressin system is involved in the rewarding, prosocial, and anxiolytic effects of MDMA, DOB, and PMA in zebra fish and underline the association between this system and the behavioral alterations associated with disorders related to substance abuse.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Oxidative stress and neurotrophic factors are involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD). Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a naturally occurring compound with strong antioxidant properties. The present study investigated ALA effects in an amphetamine-induced model of mania.
METHODS: In the reversal protocol, adult mice were first given d-amphetamine (AMPH) 2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.) or saline for 14 days. Between days 8 and 14, the animals received ALA 50 or 100 mg/kg orally, lithium (Li) 47.5 mg/kg i.p., or saline. In the prevention paradigm, mice were pretreated with ALA, Li, or saline prior to AMPH. Locomotor activity was assessed in the open-field task. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, reduced glutathione (GSH), and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) levels were evaluated in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HC), and striatum (ST). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were measured in the HC.
RESULTS: ALA and Li prevented and reversed the AMPH-induced increase in locomotor activity. PREVENTION MODEL: ALA and Li co-administration with AMPH prevented the decrease in SOD activity induced by AMPH in the HC and ST, respectively; ALA and Li prevented GSH alteration in the HC and TBARS formation in all brain areas studied. REVERSAL MODEL: ALA reversed the decrease in SOD activity in the ST. TBARS formation was reversed by ALA and Li in all brain areas. Furthermore, ALA reversed AMPH-induced decreases in BDNF and GSH in the HC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that ALA, similarly to Li, is effective in reversing and preventing AMPH-induced behavioral and neurochemical alterations, providing a rationale for the design of clinical trials investigating ALA's possible antimanic effect.},

	abstract = {Cocaine abuse disrupts dopamine system function, and reduces cocaine inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT), which results in tolerance. Although tolerance is a hallmark of cocaine addiction and a DSM-V criterion for substance abuse disorders, the molecular adaptations producing tolerance are unknown, and testing the impact of DAT changes on drug taking behaviors has proven difficult. In regard to treatment, amphetamine has shown efficacy in reducing cocaine intake; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects have not been explored. The goals of this study were twofold; we sought to (1) identify the molecular mechanisms by which cocaine exposure produces tolerance and (2) determine whether amphetamine-induced reductions in cocaine intake are connected to these mechanisms. Using cocaine self-administration and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in male rats, we show that low-dose, continuous amphetamine treatment, during self-administration or abstinence, completely reversed cocaine tolerance. Amphetamine treatment also reversed escalated cocaine intake and decreased motivation to obtain cocaine as measured in a behavioral economics task, thereby linking tolerance to multiple facets of cocaine use. Finally, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging, we found that cocaine tolerance is associated with the formation of DAT-DAT complexes, and that amphetamine disperses these complexes. In addition to extending our basic understanding of DATs and their role in cocaine reinforcement, we serendipitously identified a novel therapeutic target: DAT oligomer complexes. We show that dispersion of oligomers is concomitant with reduced cocaine intake, and propose that pharmacotherapeutics aimed at these complexes may have potential for cocaine addiction treatment.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Tolerance to cocaine's subjective effects is a cardinal symptom of cocaine addiction and a DSM-V criterion for substance abuse disorders. However, elucidating the molecular adaptions that produce tolerance and determining its behavioral impact have proven difficult. Using cocaine self-administration in rats, we link tolerance to cocaine effects at the dopamine transporter (DAT) with aberrant cocaine-taking behaviors. Further, tolerance was associated with multi-DAT complexes, which formed after cocaine exposure. Treatment with amphetamine deconstructed DAT complexes, reversed tolerance, and decreased cocaine seeking. These data describe the behavioral consequence of cocaine tolerance, provide a putative mechanism for its development, and suggest that compounds that disperse DAT complexes may be efficacious treatments for cocaine addiction.},

The existence of the D1-D2 heteromer in the striatum of rat and monkey was established using in situ PLA, in situ FRET and co-immunoprecipitation. In rat, D1-D2 receptor heteromer activation led to place aversion and abolished cocaine CPP and locomotor sensitization, cocaine intravenous self-administration and reinstatement of cocaine seeking, as well as inhibited sucrose preference and abolished the motivation to seek palatable food. Selective disruption of this heteromer by a specific interfering peptide induced reward-like effects and enhanced the above cocaine-induced effects, including at a subthreshold dose of cocaine. The D1-D2 heteromer activated Cdk5/Thr75-DARPP-32 and attenuated cocaine-induced pERK and ΔFosB accumulation, together with inhibition of cocaine-enhanced local field potentials in NAc, blocking thus the signaling pathway activated by cocaine: D1R/cAMP/PKA/Thr34-DARPP-32/pERK with ΔFosB accumulation. In conclusion, our results show that the D1-D2 heteromer exerted tonic inhibitory control of basal natural and cocaine reward, and therefore initiates a fundamental physiologic function that limits the liability to develop cocaine addiction.},

	abstract = {The neurodegenerative disorder Huntington’s disease (HD) is typically characterized by extensive loss of striatal neurons and the midlife onset of debilitating and progressive chorea, dementia, and psychological disturbance. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, translating to an elongated glutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. The pathogenic mechanism resulting in cell dysfunction and death beyond the causative mutation is not well defined. To further delineate the early molecular events in HD, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on striatal tissue from a cohort of 5-y-old OVT73-line sheep expressing a human CAG-expansion HTT cDNA transgene. Our HD OVT73 sheep are a prodromal model and exhibit minimal pathology and no detectable neuronal loss. We identified significantly increased levels of the urea transporter SLC14A1 in the OVT73 striatum, along with other important osmotic regulators. Further investigation revealed elevated levels of the metabolite urea in the OVT73 striatum and cerebellum, consistent with our recently published observation of increased urea in postmortem human brain from HD cases. Extending that finding, we demonstrate that postmortem human brain urea levels are elevated in a larger cohort of HD cases, including those with low-level neuropathology (Vonsattel grade 0/1). This elevation indicates increased protein catabolism, possibly as an alternate energy source given the generalized metabolic defect in HD. Increased urea and ammonia levels due to dysregulation of the urea cycle are known to cause neurologic impairment. Taken together, our findings indicate that aberrant urea metabolism could be the primary biochemical disruption initiating neuropathogenesis in HD.},

	abstract = {A more selective oxytocin receptor agonist
Oxytocin is clinically used to induce labor, and there is interest in using this peptide to treat social disorders. However, oxytocin triggers adverse cardiovascular side effects because it activates the vasopressin receptor and the oxytocin receptor. Muttenthaler et al. generated ligands based on oxytocin with subtle modifications, yielding a lead compound that was more selective for the oxytocin receptor than for the vasopressin receptors. It reduced social fear in mice and induced contractile activity in human myometrial strips without affecting cultured cardiomyocytes. Given the cross-talk between oxytocin, vasopressin, and their receptors, this compound will also be helpful in identifying effects that are solely mediated by the oxytocin receptor.
Oxytocin and vasopressin mediate various physiological functions that are important for osmoregulation, reproduction, cardiovascular function, social behavior, memory, and learning through four G protein–coupled receptors that are also implicated in high-profile disorders. Targeting these receptors is challenging because of the difficulty in obtaining ligands that retain selectivity across rodents and humans for translational studies. We identified a selective and more stable oxytocin receptor (OTR) agonist by subtly modifying the pharmacophore framework of human oxytocin and vasopressin. [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH displayed similar potency to oxytocin but improved selectivity for OTR, an effect that was retained in mice. Centrally infused [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH potently reversed social fear in mice, confirming that this action was mediated by OTR and not by V1a or V1b vasopressin receptors. In addition, [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH produced a more regular contraction pattern than did oxytocin in a preclinical labor induction and augmentation model using myometrial strips from cesarean sections. [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH had no activity in human cardiomyocytes, indicating a potentially improved safety profile and therapeutic window compared to those of clinically used oxytocin. In conclusion, [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH is a novel probe for validating OTR as a therapeutic target in various biological systems and is a promising new lead for therapeutic development. Our medicinal chemistry approach may also be applicable to other peptidergic signaling systems with similar selectivity issues.
An oxytocin derivative that may not trigger adverse side effects has been generated.

However, comparative data on the effects of methylphenidate and modafinil on negative emotions in healthy subjects have been partially missing. The aim of this study was to compare the acute effects of methylphenidate and modafinil on the neural correlates of fearful face processing using 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine as a positive control.
Methods: Using a double-blind, within-subject, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, 60 mg methylphenidate, 600 mg modafinil, and 125 mg 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine were administrated to 22 healthy subjects while performing an event-related fMRI task to assess brain activation in response to fearful faces. Negative mood states were assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and subjective ratings.
Results: Relative to placebo, modafinil, but not methylphenidate or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, increased brain activation within a limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuit during fearful face processing. Modafinil but not methylphenidate also increased amygdala responses to fearful faces compared with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Furthermore, activation in the middle and inferior frontal gyrus in response to fearful faces correlated positively with subjective feelings of fearfulness and depressiveness after modafinil administration.
Conclusions: Despite the cognitive enhancement effects of 600 mg modafinil in healthy people, potential adverse effects on emotion processing should be considered.},

	abstract = {Drug addiction is a complex neurological dysfunction induced by recurring drug intoxication. Strategies to prevent and treat drug addiction constitute a topic of research interest. Early-stage romantic love is characterized by some characteristics of addiction, which gradually disappear as the love relationship progresses. Therefore, comparison of the concordance and discordance between romantic love and drug addiction may elucidate potential treatments for addiction. This focused review uses the evidences from our recent studies to compare the neural alterations between romantic love and drug addiction, moreover we also compare the behavioral and neurochemical alterations between romantic love and drug addiction. From the behavioral comparisons we find that there are many similarities between the early stage of romantic love and drug addiction, and this stage romantic love is considered as a behavioral addiction, while significant differences exist between the later stage of romantic love and drug addiction, and this stage of romantic love eventually developed into a prosocial behavior. The neuroimaging comparisons suggest that romantic love and drug addiction both display the functional enhancement in reward and emotion regulation network. Except the similar neural changes, romantic love display special function enhancement in social cognition network, while drug addiction display special dysfunction in cognitive control network. The neurochemical comparisons show that there are many similarities in the dopamine (DA) system, while significant differences in oxytocin (OT) system for romantic love and drug addiction. These indicate that the functional alterations in reward and emotion regulation network and the DA system may be the neurophysiological basis of romantic love as a behavioral addiction, and the functional alterations in social cognition network and the OT system may be the neurophysiological basis of romantic love as a prosocial behavior. It seems that the OT system is a critical factor for the development of addiction. So we then discuss strategies to treat drug addiction with OT, and suggest that future research should further investigate OT system interventions aiming to improve cognitive control and/or social cognition functions, in order to develop strategies designed to more effectively treat drug addiction.},

	abstract = {Two baselines involving a repeated acquisition task were used to assess the effects of bretazenil, imidazenil, and triazolam. The first baseline was a multiple schedule of repeated acquisition and performance of conditional discriminations. In the first component, the subject acquired a four-response chain by responding sequentially on three keys in the presence of different combinations of colors and geometric forms displayed on a center key. Acquisition of the discrimination was defined by a decrease in errors as the session progressed. In the performance component, the four-response chain was the same each session. Incorrect responses in either component produced a 5s time out during which responding had no programmed consequence. The second procedure, which has been used to evaluate the effects of drugs on memory, involved the acquisition of a discrimination, followed by a 1h delay and a retest of the same discrimination to assess retention. Triazolam (0.32 and 0.56mg/kg) administered alone, produced dose-related decreases in response rate in each component. In addition, triazolam also produced a dose-related increase in percentage errors in acquisition with no effect in performance. Triazolam (0.32mg/kg) eliminated retention (0 percent savings) in the memory task. Bretazenil (0.1-5.6mg/kg) or imidazenil (0.1-1.8mg/kg) administered alone had little or no effect on either rate of responding or accuracy in either component. Furthermore, bretazenil but not imidazenil disrupted retention at the higher doses tested. The combination of imidazenil or bretazenil with triazolam produced dose-related attenuation of the disruptive effects of triazolam on both behavioral baselines. These data suggest that the disruptive effects of benzodiazepines on learning and memory may be a function of the intrinsic efficacy of these compounds at different GABA(A) receptor subtypes.},

In humans, however, safety and tolerability studies showed that there was pronounced sedation at a dose of 2 mg, resulting in a maximal tolerated dose of 1 mg. This 2 mg dose corresponded to a C(max) plasma concentration of 28 ng/mL, which, based on the rodent plasma EC(50) for occupancy of 115 ng/mL, suggested that sedation in humans occurs at low levels of occupancy. This was confirmed in human positron emission tomography studies, in which [(11)C]flumazenil uptake following a single dose of 1 mg MRK-409 was comparable to that of placebo, indicating that occupancy of GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine binding sites by MRK-409 was below the limits of detection (i.e. {\textless}10\%). Taken together, these data show that MRK-409 causes sedation in humans at a dose (2 mg) corresponding to levels of occupancy considerably less than those predicted from rodent models to be required for anxiolytic efficacy (∼35-65\%). Thus, the preclinical non-sedating anxiolytic profile of MRK-409 did not translate into humans and further development of this compound was halted.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the pharmacologic effects and abuse liability of bretazenil, a partial benzodiazepine agonist, and compare them to the short-term effects of diazepam and alprazolam over a range of doses.
METHODS: This was a placebo, within-subject, randomized, double-blind study conducted in 28 male volunteers. They were experienced but nondependent users of central nervous system depressants who had the ability to reliably distinguish 150 mg secobarbital from placebo and to report positive subjective effects. Subjects randomly received placebo and the two middle doses of diazepam, bretazenil, and alprazolam for the first 7 days of the study and, depending on their clinical response, received either the highest or the lowest dose of each drug for the remaining 3 days. Pharmacologic effects were assessed by use of objective tests (e.g., psychomotor performance), subject-rated questionnaires (e.g., Profile of Mood States), and observer-rated scales.
RESULTS: All three drugs were clearly distinguishable from placebo on most measures. Diazepam and alprazolam produced dose-related psychomotor and memory impairment, whereas bretazenil produced a flatter slope. Both alprazolam and diazepam produced dose-dependent increases in subject and observer-rated sedation and liking, whereas bretazenil showed increases compared with placebo, but these effects were not dose dependent.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from the study supported the view that bretazenil may have a partial agonist pharmacologic profile. Scores on subjective effects scales considered important for abuse liability assessment suggest a lower abuse liability of bretazenil than diazepam and alprazolam.},

The present study utilized modulation of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding and enhancement of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake to further assess Ro 16-6028's partial agonist profile in vitro. Ro 16-6028 was the most potent benzodiazepine examined, exhibiting an IC50 (concentration at which half-maximal inhibition of specific [35S]TBPS binding occurs) of 6.1 nM, compared to clonazepam (7.9 nM), flunitrazepam (13.6 nM) and diazepam (91.1 nM). The rank order of potency for inhibition of [35S]TBPS binding was identical to that for inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam binding. However, Ro 16-6028 was less efficacious in that it produced 27\% inhibition of specific [35S]TBPS binding, compared to clonazepam (34\%), flunitrazepam (41\%) or diazepam (49\%). Ro 16-6028 antagonized the inhibition of [35S]TBPS binding produced by 10 microM diazepam. Ro 16-6028 was also more potent and less efficacious than diazepam in potentiating GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake. These results provide further evidence that Ro 16-6028 is acting as a partial agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor in modulating function of the GABAA receptor complex.},

There were no consistent indications for synergistic, supra-additive pharmacodynamic interactions between alcohol and bretazenil or diazepam. 6. Bretazenil with or without alcohol, and diazepam+alcohol had marked effects. Because subjects were often too sedated to perform the adaptive tracking test and the eye movement tests adequately, ceiling effects may have affected the outcome of these tests. 7. No significant pharmacokinetic interactions were found. 8.

Safety and tolerability were evaluated by changes in vital signs, incidence and severity of adverse reactions and biochemical and haematological screening. Drug effects were estimated utilizing a bipolar visual analogue scale (poles: 'sleepy'-'alert') and a psychomotor task, the digit symbol substitution task. The pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses were also determined in the multiple dose study. 3. Abecarnil was generally well tolerated. In the single dose study the most frequently reported side effects associated with abecarnil at high doses (20 and 40 mg) were dizziness, unsteady gait, and lack of concentration. A decrement in performance on the digit symbol substitution task was also observed in the two high dosage groups 20 mg and 40 mg. Evaluation of visual analogue scale ratings did not reveal a sedative effect even at higher doses. 4.

Since it was not clear whether this sedation was                     mediated via the α2/α3 or α1 GABAA subtype(s), we                     characterized the properties of TPA023B, a high-affinity imidazotriazine which,                     like MRK-409, has partial agonist efficacy at the α2 and α3 subtype                     but is an antagonist at the α1 subtype, at which MRK-409 has weak partial                     agonism. TPA023B gave dose- and time-dependent occupancy of rat brain                         GABAA receptors as measured using an in vivo                     [3H]flumazenil binding assay, with 50\% occupancy                     corresponding to a respective dose and plasma drug concentration of                     0.09 mg/kg and 19 ng/mL, the latter of which was similar to that                     observed in mice (25 ng/mL) and comparable to values obtained in baboon                     and man using [11C]flumazenil PET (10 and 5.8 ng/mL,                     respectively). TPA023B was anxiolytic in rodent and primate (squirrel monkey)                     models of anxiety (elevated plus maze, fear-potentiated startle, conditioned                     suppression of drinking, conditioned emotional response) yet had no significant                     effects in rodent or primate assays of ataxia and/or myorelaxation (rotarod,                     chain-pulling, lever pressing), up to doses (10 mg/kg) corresponding to                     occupancy of greater than 99\%.

Evolution of the understanding of the biochemical basis for BZ effects in the 1980s and 1990s, coupled with regulatory emphasis on collection of data used in legal scheduling decisions, made possible a targeted search for drugs that would provide effective treatment for anxiety disorders in the absence of abuse liability or dependence potential. Compounds that have selective efficacy at subtypes of the Î³-aminobutyric acid type A receptor, are active in preclinical anxiolytic screens, but negative in preclinical studies of behavior relevant to evaluation of abuse liability appear to be one promising means for achieving this end.},

For both compounds, preclinical data suggested efficacy as nonsedating anxiolytics. Self-injection of TPA123 (0.0032-0.1 mg/kg) and TPA023 (0.0032-0.32 mg/kg) was compared with lorazepam (0.01-0.32 mg/kg) in baboons. TPA123 and lorazepam maintained self-injection higher than vehicle at two or more doses in each baboon; peak rate of self-injection of lorazepam was higher than TPA123. Self-injected lorazepam and TPA123 also increased rates of concurrently occurring food-maintained behavior. After the availability of self-administered TPA123 doses ended, an effect consistent with a mild benzodiazepine-like withdrawal syndrome occurred. In contrast with lorazepam and TPA123, TPA023 did not maintain self-administration. Positron emission tomography studies showed that TPA023 produced a dose-dependent inhibition in the binding of [(11)C]flumazenil to the benzodiazepine binding site in the baboon, which was essentially complete (i.e., 100\% occupancy) at the highest TPA023 dose (0.32 mg/kg). In a physical dependence study, TPA023 (32 mg/kg/24 h) was delivered as a continuous intragastric drip. Neither flumazenil at 14 days nor stopping TPA023 after 30 to 31 days resulted in the marked withdrawal syndrome characteristic of benzodiazepines in baboons.

	abstract = {Wake and sleep states have long been known to be implemented by distinct synchronized neural oscillations. Changes in the pattern of neural oscillations have recently been recognized to be largely due to the impact of GABAergic regulation. Inhibitory interneurons are the main players in sculpting neuronal rhythms, controlling spike timing, selecting network assemblies and implementing brain states. A rich diversity of GABAergic interneurons imprints its activity, mediated through a comparably rich diversity of GABAA receptors. Pharmacologically, there is a clear division of labor among GABAA receptor subtypes. Sedation, a common denominator of GABAA receptor-related hypnotics, is mediated via α1GABAA receptors. However, the hypnotic EEG finger print of diazepam is largely linked to α2GABAA receptors, pointing to two distinct receptor systems for sleep regulation. Anxiety is a major impairment of sleep, which can be selectively controlled by α2 GABAA receptor modulators. Chronic pain, another frequent sleep impediment can be alleviated by α2/GABAA receptor modulators. Chronic pain, another frequent sleep impediment can be alleviated by α2/α3GABAA receptor modulators. Finally, cognitive deficits can be pharmacologically addressed by partial inverse agonists of α5GABAA receptors. Thus, in the future, it is conceivable that disease-specific hypnotics could be developed by combining the modulation of suitable GABAA receptor subtypes. GABAB receptors play a pharmacological role as target of γ-hydroxybutyrate, which is frequently used in the treatment of narcolepsy. Thus, as our understanding of GABAergic deficits in sleep disturbances increases, the strategic targeting of GABA receptor subtypes may represent a new approach for the personalized pharmacological management of sleep disorders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Since its market release, gabapentin has been presumed to have no abuse potential and subsequently has been prescribed widely off-label, despite increasing reports of gabapentin misuse. This review estimates and describes the prevalence and effects of, motivations behind and risk factors for gabapentin misuse, abuse and diversion.
METHODS: Databases were searched for peer-reviewed papers demonstrating gabapentin misuse, characterized by taking a larger dosage than prescribed or taking gabapentin without a prescription, and diversion. All types of studies were considered; grey literature was excluded. Thirty-three papers met inclusion criteria, consisting of 23 case studies and 11 epidemiological reports. Published reports came from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Finland, India, South Africa and France, and two analyzed websites not specific to a particular country.
RESULTS: Prevalence of gabapentin misuse in the general population was reported to be 1\%, 40-65\% among individuals with prescriptions and between 15 and 22\% within populations of people who abuse opioids. An array of subjective experiences reminiscent of opioids, benzodiazepines and psychedelics were reported over a range of doses, including those within clinical recommendations. Gabapentin was misused primarily for recreational purposes, self-medication or intentional self-harm and was misused alone or in combination with other substances, especially opioids, benzodiazepines and/or alcohol. Individuals with histories of drug abuse were most often involved in its misuse.
CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological and case report evidence suggests that the anti-epileptic and analgesic medication gabapentin is being misused internationally, with substance abuse populations at special risk for misuse/abuse.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify case reports and studies regarding patients who abused, became dependent on, or experienced withdrawal from gabapentin.
DATA SOURCES: A PubMed literature search (1993 to October 2015) was performed using the search terms gabapentin, withdrawal, dependence, and addiction. Additional references were identified from a review of literature citations.
STUDY SELECTION: All English-language case reports and studies were evaluated.
DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 18 case reports or case series were identified regarding addiction to or withdrawal from gabapentin. All the cases of addiction were in patients who had a previous history of alcohol, cocaine, or opioid abuse. On average, the patients were taking more than 3000 mg/d (600-8000 mg/d). Two surveys reported that the misuse of gabapentin was 1.1\% in the general population and 22\% in drug abuse treatment centers. Withdrawal, when reported, occurred within 12 hours to 7 days of discontinuation of the medication.
CONCLUSION: There have been numerous documented cases of gabapentin abuse, dependence, and withdrawal. Even though gabapentin is sometimes considered as a treatment option for alcohol and substance abuse, it is important to monitor for drug-seeking behaviors. A history of alcohol or substance abuse appears to be an important part of a patient's medical history when evaluating their risk for addiction and dependence behaviors. Health care providers need to be aware of this risk in their patients and monitor their patients for signs of abuse and dependence along with withdrawal symptoms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gabapentinoid (pregabalin and gabapentin) abuse is increasingly being reported.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent of gabapentinoid abuse, characteristics of typical abusers, patterns of abuse, and potential harms in order to bring this trend to providers' attention.
METHODS: A systematic review of MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and US FDA data, indexed through 28 July 2016, utilizing the following searches: pregabalin OR gabapentin OR gabapentinoid AND one of the following: abuse, misuse, overdose, or substance-related disorders[MESH], was conducted. Additional studies were identified through review of references. English-language epidemiological studies, clinical studies, and case reports/series of gabapentinoid abuse/misuse/overdose were included. The authors reached consensus regarding study inclusion after full-text review. The body of literature was assessed for bias qualitatively.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine studies were included in this systematic review (24 epidemiological, three clinical abuse liability, 16 abuse/misuse/dependence case reports/series, 17 acute overdose case reports/series-one included both an epidemiological study and case series and was included in both counts). Analysis of these studies indicates increasing numbers of patients are self-administering higher than recommended doses to achieve euphoric highs. In the general population, a 1.6\% prevalence of gabapentinoid abuse was observed, whereas prevalence ranged from 3\% to 68\% among opioid abusers. An international adverse event database identified 11,940 reports of gabapentinoid abuse from 2004-2015, with {\textgreater}75\% reported since 2012. Risk factors include a history of substance abuse, particularly opioids, and psychiatric co-morbidities. While effects of excessively high doses are generally non-lethal, gabapentinoids are increasingly being identified in post-mortem toxicology analyses.
CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests gabapentinoids possess potential for abuse, particularly in individuals with a history of opioid abuse, and reports of such abuse are increasingly being documented. Prescribers should be aware of high-risk populations and monitor for signs of abuse.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic assessment of the abuse potential/prevalence of gabapentin in a large sample.
DATA SOURCE: Truven Health MarketScan® Commercial Claims and Encounters database, years 2013-2015.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Patients with two or more claims for one or more abusable drugs and ≥12 months' continuous enrollment were sampled for Lorenz curve analysis. Prevalence analysis was limited to those with ≥120 days of therapy.
METHODS: Abuse potential was measured as Lorenz-1 (consumption of drug supply by top 1\% of users) of ≥15\%. Dose thresholds were morphine milligram equivalent (MME) standards for opioids, and maximum labeled doses in milligrams (mg) for other drugs.
RESULTS: Lorenz-1 values were 37\% opioids, 19\% gabapentin, 15\% pregabalin, 14\% alprazolam, and 13\% zolpidem. The top 1\% gabapentin users filled prescriptions for a mean (median) 11,274 (9534) mg/day, more than three times the recommended maximum (3600 mg). Of these, one-quarter used or diverted ≥12,822 mg/day. The top 1\% opioid and pregabalin users filled prescriptions for a mean (median) 180 (127) MMEs and 2474 (2219) mg/day, respectively. Of patients using opioids + gabapentin simultaneously, 24\% had three or more claims exceeding the dose threshold within 12 months.
LIMITATIONS: Established threshold criteria for gabapentinoid abuse are uncertain. Indications for gabapentinoid use (e.g. hot flashes, restless legs syndrome) were not measured.
CONCLUSION: Gabapentin use patterns are similar to those of other abusable medications. High daily doses pose safety and/or diversion concerns, and investigation of the medical consequences of gabapentin abuse is needed.},

	abstract = {Gabapentin is an antiepileptic drug with an unknown mechanism of action apparently dissimilar to that of other antiepileptic agents, and possessing some desirable pharmacokinetic traits. The drug is not protein bound, is not metabolised and does not induce liver enzymes, diminishing the likelihood of drug interactions with other antiepileptic agents and drugs such as oral contraceptives. Although gabapentin is a structural analogue of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, gabapentin penetrates into the CNS and its activity is seemingly distinct from GABA-related effects. Present clinical evaluation is largely restricted to proof of efficacy trials of gabapentin as add-on therapy in patients with partial epilepsy resistant to conventional treatment. Gabapentin (usually 600 to 1800 mg/day) provides notable benefit, reducing seizure frequency by {\textgreater} or = 50\% in 18 to 28\% of patients with refractory partial seizures, as shown in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Overall, seizure frequency decreased by 18 to 32\% during 3-month treatment periods. Patients with complex partial seizures, and partial seizures secondarily generalised, are particularly likely to respond to gabapentin. Current experience with the drug in other seizure types, and as monotherapy, is limited. Mild adverse events, commonly somnolence, fatigue, ataxia and dizziness, have been reported in about 75\% of gabapentin recipients. While the drug has been well tolerated when administered to a few patients for periods of up to 5 years, its long term tolerability profile has yet to be fully expounded. Thus, with its favourable pharmacokinetic profile, and efficacy in some refractory patients, gabapentin is poised to fill a niche as an adjunct to the treatment of partial epilepsy. Promising results obtained thus far warrant further work to clarify its long term tolerability, its possible efficacy in other seizure types, its position relative to other agents and its use as monotherapy. In the meantime, gabapentin is likely to provide a much-needed option in a therapeutic area requiring complex management.},

Pregabalin is approved in US and Europe for adjunctive therapy of partial seizures in adults, and also has been approved for the treatment of pain from diabetic neuropathy or post-herpetic neuralgia in adults. Recently, it has been approved for treatment of anxiety disorders in Europe. Pregabalin is structurally related to the antiepileptic drug gabapentin and the site of action of both drugs is similar, the alpha2-delta (alpha2-delta) protein, an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. Pregabalin subtly reduces the synaptic release of several neurotransmitters, apparently by binding to alpha2-delta subunits, and possibly accounting for its actions in vivo to reduce neuronal excitability and seizures. Several studies indicate that the pharmacology of pregabalin requires binding to alpha2-delta subunits, including structure-activity analyses of compounds binding to alpha2-delta subunits and pharmacology in mice deficient in binding at the alpha2-delta Type 1 protein. The preclinical findings to date are consistent with a mechanism that may entail reduction of abnormal neuronal excitability through reduced neurotransmitter release. This review addresses the preclinical pharmacology of pregabalin, and also the biology of the high affinity binding site, and presumed site of action.},

Distribution volume image data were analyzed by means of statistical parametric mapping.RESULTS: Lower distribution volumes were found in the prefrontal cortex (Brodmannâ€™s area 9) of PTSD patients than in comparison subjects.CONCLUSIONS: These findings of lower values for the benzodiazepine receptor binding measure of distribution volume are consistent with fewer benzodiazepine receptors and/or reduced affinity of receptor binding in the medial prefrontal cortex in patients with PTSD.

Animal data have shown alterations in the GABA(A) receptor complex by uncontrollable stressors. SPECT imaging with benzodiazepine ligands showed lower distribution volumes of the benzodiazepine-GABA(A) receptor in the prefrontal cortex of patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in one, but not in another study. The objective of the present study was to assess differences in the benzodiazepine-GABA(A) receptor complex in veterans with and without PTSD using [(11)C]flumazenil and positron emission tomography (PET). Nine drug naive male Dutch veterans with deployment related PTSD and seven male Dutch veterans without PTSD were recruited, and matched for age, region and year of deployment. Each subject received a [(11)C]flumazenil PET scan and a structural magnetic resonance imaging scan. Dynamic 3D PET scans with a total duration of 60 min were acquired, and binding in template based and manually defined regions of interest (ROI) was quantified using validated plasma input and reference tissue models. In addition, parametric binding potential images were compared on a voxel-by-voxel basis using statistical parametric mapping (SPM2). ROI analyses using both template based and manual ROIs showed significantly reduced [(11)C]flumazenil binding in PTSD subjects throughout the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus. SPM analysis confirmed these results. The observed global reduction of [(11)C]flumazenil binding in patients with PTSD provides circumstantial evidence for the role of the benzodiazepine-GABA(A) receptor in the pathophysiology of PTSD and is consistent with previous animal research and clinical psychopharmacological studies.},

	abstract = {Benzodiazepines of natural origin (NBZDs) have been found in human blood and brains as well as in medicinal plants and foods. In plasma and brain tissue there are i.e. diazepam and nordiazepam equal to commercial drugs but there are also other benzodiazepine-like compounds termed "endozepines", which act as agonists at the benzodiazepine receptors of central type (CBR). A synthetic pathway for the production of NBZDs has not yet been found, but it has been suggested that micro-organisms may synthesize molecules with benzodiazepine-like structures. Hence NBZDs could be of both endogenous and exogenous source and be considered as natural anxyolitic and sedative. Interestingly there are also natural compounds, such as the polypeptide Diazepam Binding Inhibitor (DBI) acting as an "inversive agonist" implicated in fair and panic disorders. It has been suggested that NBZDs may play a role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Multidirectional studies evaluated NBZDs levels (1) in the blood of normal subjects, of cirrhotic with or without HE and in commercial benzodiazepine consumers; (2) in the blood of cirrhotic treated or not with a non-absorbable antibiotic; (3) in several constituents of our diet. In conclusion, NBZDs increase sometime in cirrhotics with or without HE but they reach concentrations not higher than those found in commercial benzodiazepines consumers. Hence NBZDs must be considered as occasional precipitating factor of HE and benzodiazepine antagonists only symptomatic drugs. The finding that NBZDs may be in part synthesized by intestinal bacterial flora and in part constituent of our diet underlines the importance to feed cirrhotic patients with selected food.},

	abstract = {Reduced cognitive abilities are often characterized by an impairment of flexibility, i.e. the ability to switch from learned rules or categories that were important in certain contexts to different new modalities that rule the task. Drugs targeting the dopamine transporter (DAT) are widely used for their potential to enhance cognitive abilities. However commercially available drugs are of limited specificity for DAT, blocking also noradrenaline and serotonine transporters, that can lead to unwanted side effects in healthy subjects. Therefore, we tested a newly synthetized compound (CE-123) with higher specificity for DAT in male rats in an attentional set-shifting task (ASST), that proves for cognitive flexibility and a 5-choice serial-reaction time task (5-CSRTT) assessing visuospatial attention and impulsivity. Treated rats at a dose of 0.3 and 1.0 but not 0.1 mg/kg bodyweight showed reduced extradimensional shifts in the ASST compared to controls indicating increased cognitive flexibility. Rats treated with R-Modafinil, a commercially available DAT inhibitor at a dose of 10 mg/kg bodyweight showed increased premature responses, an indicator of increased impulsivity, during a 10s but not a 2.5 s, 5 s or 7.5 s intertrial interval when compared to vehicle treated rats in the 5-CSRTT. This was not found in rats treated with CE-123 at the same dose as for R-Modafinil. Visuospatial attention, except premature responses, did not differ between R-Modafinil and CE-123 treated rats and their respective controls. Thus, CE-123 increased cognitive flexibility with diminished impulsivity.},

It can also correlate with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-homocarnosine interaction, with possible anticonvulsive effects. We investigated 31 children with autistic spectrum disorders in an 8-week, double-blinded study to determine if 800 mg L-carnosine daily would result in observable changes versus placebo. Outcome measures were the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale, the Expressive and Receptive One-Word Picture Vocabulary tests, and Clinical Global Impressions of Change. Children on placebo did not show statistically significant changes. After 8 weeks on L-carnosine, children showed statistically significant improvements on the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (total score and the Behavior, Socialization, and Communication subscales) and the Receptive One-Word Picture Vocabulary test (all P {\textless} .05). Improved trends were noted on other outcome measures. Although the mechanism of action of L-carnosine is not well understood, it may enhance neurologic function, perhaps in the enterorhinal or temporal cortex.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose Synthetic cannabinoids (often sold as Spice or K2) have become a very popular alternative to cannabis due to their easy access and portrayed safety. Controlled studies on the behavioural effects of synthetic cannabinoids are currently lacking, which hampers risk assessments of these compounds. Experimental Approach This is a first attempt to assess the influence of a synthetic cannabinoid, JWH-018, on neurocognition and subjective experience in humans after controlled administration. JWH-018, 2 and 3 mg, was administered to six healthy cannabis-experienced volunteers in a placebo-controlled, cross-over study following an escalating dosing schedule. Participants were monitored for 12 h after drug administration, and several neurocognitive measures and subjective questionnaires were taken. Key Results Serum concentrations of JWH-018 were highest after the 2 mg dose but generally low after administration of both doses. Both doses of JWH-018 were well tolerated, and no serious side effects were reported. Participants reported feeling more ‘high’ at 1 and 2 h after administration, particularly after the 2 mg dose. Behavioural impairments also emerged despite the low serum concentrations of JWH-018. The low dose of JWH-018 impaired performance on the tracking, divided attention and stop signal task. Conclusion and Implications JWH-018 dosing in the present study resulted in drug concentrations that were generally low and not fully representative of common use. Yet initial impairments of neurocognitive function and subjective feelings of high did emerge despite low levels of JWH-018 in serum. Higher doses are needed to obtain a more representative risk profile of JWH-018.},

	abstract = {Excessive ethanol (EtOH) intake, especially to prenatal exposure, can significantly affect cognitive function and cause permanent learning and memory injures in children. As a result, how to protect children from EtOH neurotoxicity has gained increasing attention in recent years. Piracetam (Pir) is a nootropic drug derived from c-aminobutyric acid and can manage cognition impairments in multiple neurological disorders. Studies have shown that Pir can exert therapeutic effects on EtOH-induced memory impairments, but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. In this study, we found that Pir inhibited ethanol-induced memory deficit by mediating multiple pathways. Treatment with EtOH could cause cognitive deficit in juvenile rats, and triggered the alteration of synaptic plasticity. Administration with Pir significantly increased long-term potentiation and protected hippocampus neurons from EtOH neurotoxicity. Pir intervention ameliorated EtOH-induced cell apoptosis and inhibited the activation of Caspase-3 in vitro, suggesting that Pir protected neurons by anti-apoptotic effects. Pir could decrease the expression of LC3-II and Beclin-1 induced by EtOH, and increase the phosphorylation of mTOR and reduce the phosphorylation of Akt, which suggested that the protective effect of Pir was involved in regulation of autophagic process and mTOR/Akt pathways. In conclusion, we speculate that Pir reduces EtOH-induced neuronal damage by regulation of apoptotic action and autophagic action, and our research offers preclinical evidence for the application of Pir in ethanol toxicity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alcohol disturbances, NO stimulation (by the NO-precursor L-arginine), and/or NO-synthesis blockade (by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, i.e. L-NAME) were challenged with stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, which inhibits both acute alcohol intoxication and alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
MATERIAL/METHODS: Mice received intraperitoneally (i.p.) BPC 157 (10 microg/kg), L-NAME (10 mg/kg), and L-arginine (400 mg/kg), alone or in combination, 5 minutes before or after acute ethanol (4 g/kg i.p.) intoxication or after 0, 3, or 7 hours of withdrawal after drinking 20\% alcohol for 13 days.
RESULTS: BPC 157 rapidly opposes the strongest disturbance presentations in acute intoxication (sustained ethanol anesthesia, complete loss of righting reflex, no reaction to external stimuli, hypothermia, 25\% mortality) and withdrawal (prominent seizures). NO-agents: Aggravation of acute alcohol intoxication and opposition to withdrawal are common, but the later intervals affected by L-arginine and the action throughout the experiment by L-NAME are distinctive. Given together, L-arginine and L-NAME counteract each other, while either the "L-NAME presentation" (acute intoxication) or the "L-arginine presentation" (withdrawal) predominates. BPC157+NO-agent: In acute intoxication (L-NAME predominating in NO-system functioning to aggravate intoxication), both BPC157+L-NAME and BPC157+L-arginine follow the presentation of L-NAME, but without worsened mortality. In withdrawal (L-arginine predominating in NO-system functioning to oppose disturbance symptoms), BPC157+L-NAME follows the presentation of L-NAME, while BPC 157+L-arginine imitates that of L-arginine.
CONCLUSIONS: The relationships among pentadecapeptide BPC 157, the NO-system, acute alcohol intoxication, and opposed withdrawal may be important, presenting pentadecapeptide BPC 157 as a suitable alcohol antagonist.},

	volume = {29},
	issn = {0145-6008},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous research has implicated the alpha5-containing GABAA receptors of the hippocampus in the reinforcing properties of alcohol. In the present study, a selective GABAA alpha5 benzodiazepine inverse agonist (e.g., RY 023) was used in a series of in vivo and in vitro studies to determine the significance of the alpha5-receptor in the neurobehavioral actions of alcohol.
METHODS: In experiment one, systemic injections of RY 023 (1 to 10 mg/kg IP) dose-dependently reduced ethanol-maintained responding by 52\% to 86\% of controls, whereas bilateral hippocampal infusions (0.3 to 20 microg) reduced responding by 66\% to 84\% of controls. Saccharin responding was reduced only with the highest intraperitoneal (e.g., 10 mg) and microinjected (e.g., 20 microg) doses. In experiment two, RY 023 (3.0 to 15 mg/kg IP) reversed the motor-impairing effects of a moderate dose of alcohol (0.75 g/kg) on an oscillating bar task in the absence of intrinsic effects. In the open field, RY 023 (3.0 to 7.5 mg/kg) produced intrinsic effects alone but attenuated the suppression of the 1.25 g/kg ethanol dose. Because the diazepam-insensitive receptors (e.g., alpha4 and alpha6) have been suggested to play a role in alcohol motor impairing and sedative actions, experiment three compared the efficacy of RY 023 with Ro 15-4513 and two prototypical benzodiazepine antagonists (e.g., flumazenil and ZK 93426) across the alpha4beta3gamma2-, alpha5beta3gamma2-, and alpha6beta3gamma2-receptor subtypes in Xenopus oocytes.
RESULTS: RY 023 produced classic inverse agonism at all receptor subtypes, whereas Ro15-4513 and the two antagonists displayed a neutral or agonistic profile at the diazepam-insensitive receptors.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results extend our previous findings by demonstrating that an alpha5-subtype ligand is capable of attenuating not only the rewarding action of alcohol but also its motor impairing and sedative effects. We propose that these actions are mediated in part by the alpha5-receptors of the hippocampus. The hippocampal alpha5-receptors could represent novel targets in understanding the neuromechanisms regulating the neurobehavioral actions of alcohol in humans.},

In order to elucidate changes in the cortical-limbic circuitry associated with PSD and its treatment, we examined a novel mouse model of persistent PSD. Focal endothelin-1-induced ischemia of the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in male C57BL6 mice resulted in a chronic anxiety and depression phenotype. Here, we show severe cognitive impairment in spatial learning and memory in the stroke mice. The behavioral and cognitive phenotypes were reversed by chronic (4-week) treatment with fluoxetine, alone or with voluntary exercise (free-running wheel), but not by exercise alone. To assess chronic cellular activation, FosB+ cells were co-labeled for markers of glutamate/pyramidal (VGluT1-3/CaMKIIα), γ-aminobutyric acid (GAD67), and serotonin (TPH). At 6 weeks poststroke versus sham (or 4 days poststroke), left mPFC stroke induced widespread FosB activation, more on the right (contralesional) than on the left side. Stroke activated glutamate cells of the mPFC, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and raphe serotonin neurons. Chronic fluoxetine balanced bilateral neuronal activity, reducing total FosB and FosB/CamKII+ cells (mPFC, nucleus accumbens), and unlike exercise, increasing FosB/GAD67+ cells (septum, amygdala) or both (hippocampus, raphe). In summary, chronic antidepressant but not exercise mediates recovery in this unilateral ischemic PSD model that is associated with region-specific reversal of stroke-induced pyramidal cell hyperactivity and increase in γ-aminobutyric acidergic activity. Targeted brain stimulation to restore brain activity could provide a rational approach for treating clinical PSD.},

Here we used ’connectome-harmonic decomposition’, a novel method to investigate the dynamical changes in brain states. We found that LSD alters the energy and the power of individual harmonic brain states in a frequency-selective manner. Remarkably, this leads to an expansion of the repertoire of active brain states, suggestive of a general re-organization of brain dynamics given the non-random increase in co-activation across frequencies. Interestingly, the frequency distribution of the active repertoire of brain states under LSD closely follows power-laws indicating a re-organization of the dynamics at the edge of criticality. Beyond the present findings, these methods open up for a better understanding of the complex brain dynamics in health and disease.},

	abstract = {IntroductionMental fatigue is a psychobiological state caused by prolonged periods of demanding cognitive activity that has negative implications on many aspects in daily life. Caffeine and carbohydrate ingestion have been shown to be able to reduce these negative effects of mental fatigue. Intake of these substances might however be less desirable in some situations (e.g., restricted caloric intake, Ramadan). Rinsing caffeine or glucose within the mouth has already been shown to improve exercise performance. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the effect of frequent caffeine-maltodextrin (CAF-MALT) mouth rinsing on mental fatigue induced by a prolonged cognitive task.MethodsTen males (age 23 ± 2 years, physical activity 7.3 ± 4.3 h/week, low CAF users) performed two trials. Participants first completed a Flanker task (3 min), then performed a 90-min mentally fatiguing task (Stroop task), followed by another Flanker task. Before the start and after each 12.5\% of the Stroop task (eight blocks), subjects received a CAF-MALT mouth rinse (MR: 0.3 g/25 ml CAF: 1.6g/25 ml MALT) or placebo (PLAC: 25 ml artificial saliva).ResultsSelf-reported mental fatigue was lower in MR (p = 0.017) compared to PLAC. Normalized accuracy (accuracy first block = 100\%) was higher in the last block of the Stroop in MR (p = 0.032) compared to PLAC. P2 amplitude in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) decreased over time only in PLAC (p = 0.017).ConclusionFrequent mouth rinsing during a prolonged and demanding cognitive task reduces mental fatigue compared to mouth rinsing with artificial saliva.},

In a rat model, our lab has shown that testosterone decreases preference for a large/uncertain reward in probability discounting. Other studies have shown that androgens decrease dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell, a region important for decision-making behavior in probability discounting. Thus, we attempted to restore selection of the large/uncertain reward in testosterone-treated rats by administering the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole or the D1 receptor agonist SKF81297 and testing probability discounting.MethodsAdolescent male Long-Evans rats were treated chronically with high-dose testosterone (7.5 mg/kg) or vehicle (13\% cyclodextrin in water), and tested for probability discounting after injections of saline, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg of quinpirole or SKF81297. Rats chose between a small/certain reward (1 sugar pellet, 100\% probability) and a large/uncertain reward (4 pellets, decreasing probability: 100, 75, 50, 25, 0\%).ResultsTestosterone-treated rats selected the large/uncertain reward significantly less than vehicle-treated controls after saline injection. However, acute injection with 0.1 mg/kg quinpirole increased large/uncertain reward preference in testosterone-treated rats only, indicated by a testosterone Ã— quinpirole interaction. At 0.5 mg/kg, quinpirole increased large/uncertain reward preference in all rats. Acute injection with SKF81297 at 0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg rescued large/uncertain reward preference in testosterone-treated rats by eliminating the difference between groups.ConclusionsIt appears that altered probability discounting behavior in testosterone-treated rats is due to both decreased D1 and D2 receptor function.},

	abstract = {Cognitive enhancement is perhaps one of the most intriguing and controversial topics in neuroscience today. Currently, the main classes of drugs used as potential cognitive enhancers include psychostimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamine), but wakefulness-promoting agents (modafinil) and glutamate activators (ampakine) are also frequently used. Pharmacologically, substances that enhance the components of the memory/learning circuits - dopamine, glutamate (neuronal excitation), and/or norepinephrine - stand to improve brain function in healthy individuals beyond their baseline functioning. In particular, non-medical use of prescription stimulants such as methylphenidate and illicit use of psychostimulants for cognitive enhancement have seen a recent rise among teens and young adults in schools and college campuses. However, this enhancement likely comes with a neuronal, as well as ethical, cost. Altering glutamate function via the use of psychostimulants may impair behavioral flexibility, leading to the development and/or potentiation of addictive behaviors. Furthermore, dopamine and norepinephrine do not display linear effects; instead, their modulation of cognitive and neuronal function maps on an inverted-U curve. Healthy individuals run the risk of pushing themselves beyond optimal levels into hyperdopaminergic and hypernoradrenergic states, thus vitiating the very behaviors they are striving to improve. Finally, recent studies have begun to highlight potential damaging effects of stimulant exposure in healthy juveniles. This review explains how the main classes of cognitive enhancing drugs affect the learning and memory circuits, and highlights the potential risks and concerns in healthy individuals, particularly juveniles and adolescents. We emphasize the performance enhancement at the potential cost of brain plasticity that is associated with the neural ramifications of nootropic drugs in the healthy developing brain.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Research in both animals and humans indicates that cannabidiol (CBD) has antipsychotic properties. The authors assessed the safety and effectiveness of CBD in patients with schizophrenia.
METHOD: In an exploratory double-blind parallel-group trial, patients with schizophrenia were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive CBD (1000 mg/day; N=43) or placebo (N=45) alongside their existing antipsychotic medication. Participants were assessed before and after treatment using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS), the Global Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF), and the improvement and severity scales of the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI-I and CGI-S).
RESULTS: After 6 weeks of treatment, compared with the placebo group, the CBD group had lower levels of positive psychotic symptoms (PANSS: treatment difference=-1.4, 95\% CI=-2.5, -0.2) and were more likely to have been rated as improved (CGI-I: treatment difference=-0.5, 95\% CI=-0.8, -0.1) and as not severely unwell (CGI-S: treatment difference=-0.3, 95\% CI=-0.5, 0.0) by the treating clinician. Patients who received CBD also showed greater improvements that fell short of statistical significance in cognitive performance (BACS: treatment difference=1.31, 95\% CI=-0.10, 2.72) and in overall functioning (GAF: treatment difference=3.0, 95\% CI=-0.4, 6.4). CBD was well tolerated, and rates of adverse events were similar between the CBD and placebo groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CBD has beneficial effects in patients with schizophrenia. As CBD's effects do not appear to depend on dopamine receptor antagonism, this agent may represent a new class of treatment for the disorder.},

	abstract = {3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “ecstasy”) enhances desire to socialize and feelings of empathy, which are thought to be related to increased oxytocin levels. Thus, variation in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) may influence responses to the drug. Here, we examined the influence of a single OXTR nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on responses to MDMA in humans. Based on findings that carriers of the A allele at rs53576 exhibit reduced sensitivity to oxytocin-induced social behavior, we hypothesized that these individuals would show reduced subjective responses to MDMA, including sociability. In this three-session, double blind, within-subjects study, healthy volunteers with past MDMA experience (N = 68) received a MDMA (0, 0.75 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg/kg) and provided self-report ratings of sociability, anxiety, and drug effects. These responses were examined in relation to rs53576. MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) did not increase sociability in individuals with the A/A genotype as it did in G allele carriers. The genotypic groups did not differ in responses at the lower MDMA dose, or in cardiovascular or other subjective responses. These findings are consistent with the idea that MDMA-induced sociability is mediated by oxytocin, and that variation in the oxytocin receptor gene may influence responses to the drug.},

	abstract = {Purpose To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) in acute ischaemic stroke and its impact on the recurrence of vascular events.
Methods We conducted a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open label, blinded, controlled clinical trial enrollingpatients with an onset of acute stroke within 7 days from five hospitals in China Jiangsu Province. Participants were assigned to the GBE group (450 mg GBE with 100 mg aspirin daily) or the control group (100 mg aspirin daily) for 6 months. The primary outcome was the decline in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were other neuropsychological tests of cognitive and neurological function, the the incidence of adverse events and vascular events.
Results 348 patients were enrolled: 179 in the GBE group and 169 in the control group. With 18 patients lost to follow-up, the dropout rate was 5.17\%. Admission data between two groups were similar, but in the GBE group there was a marked slow down in the decline in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (−2.77±0.21 vs −1.99±0.23, P=0.0116 (30 days); −3.34±0.24 vs −2.48±0.26, P=0.0165 (90 days); −4.00±0.26 vs −2.71±0.26, P=0.0004 (180 days)) compared with controls. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores at 12 and 30 days, the modified Rankin Scale scores for independent rate at 30, 90 and 180 days, and the Barthel Index scores at 30, 90 and 180 days in the GBE group were significantly improved compared with controls. Improvements were also observedin GBE groups for Mini-Metal State Examination scores of 30, 90 and 180 days, Webster’s digit symbol test scores at 30 days and Executive Dysfunction Index scores at 30 and 180 days. No significant differences were seen in the incidence of adverse events or vascular events.
Conclusions We conclude that GBE in combination with aspirin treatment alleviated cognitive and neurological deficits after acute ischaemic stroke without increasing the incidence of vascular events.

	abstract = {Vitamin C (Vit C) is considered to be a vital antioxidant molecule in the brain. Intracellular Vit C helps maintain integrity and function of several processes in the central nervous system (CNS), including neuronal maturation and differentiation, myelin formation, synthesis of catecholamine, modulation of neurotransmission and antioxidant protection. The importance of Vit C for CNS function has been proven by the fact that targeted deletion of the sodium-vitamin C co-transporter in mice results in widespread cerebral hemorrhage and death on post-natal day one. Since neurological diseases are characterized by increased free radical generation and the highest concentrations of Vit C in the body are found in the brain and neuroendocrine tissues, it is suggested that Vit C may change the course of neurological diseases and display potential therapeutic roles. The aim of this review is to update the current state of knowledge of the role of vitamin C on neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic sclerosis, as well as psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. The particular attention is attributed to understanding of the mechanisms underlying possible therapeutic properties of ascorbic acid in the presented disorders.},

The neuroprotective and anti-aging potentials of EOs and their possible mechanism of actions were evaluated by numerous researchers around the globe. Several clinically important EOs and their components from Nigella sativa, Acorus gramineus, Lavandula angustifolia, Eucalyptus globulus, Mentha piperita, Rosmarinus officinalis, Jasminum sambac, Piper nigrum and so many other plants are reported for neuroprotective effects. This review article was aimed to summarize the current finding on EOs tested against neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia. The effects of EOs on pathological targets of AD and dementia including amyloid deposition (AÎ²), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), cholinergic hypofunction, oxidative stress and glutamatergic abnormalities were focused. Furthermore, effects of EOs on other neurological disorders including anxiety, depression, cognitive hypofunction epilepsy and convulsions were also evaluated in detail. In conclusion, EOs were effective on several pathological targets and have improved cognitive performance in animal models and human subjects. Thus, EOs can be developed as multi-potent agents against neurological disorders with better efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness.},

	abstract = {The G protein-coupled serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2A receptor is primarily recognized for its role in brain neurotransmission, where it mediates a wide variety of functions, including certain aspects of cognition. However, there is significant expression of this receptor in peripheral tissues, where its importance is largely unknown. We have now discovered that activation of 5-HT2A receptors in primary aortic smooth muscle cells provides a previously unknown and extremely potent inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-mediated inflammation. 5-HT2A receptor stimulation with the agonist (R)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane [(R)-DOI] rapidly inhibits a variety of TNF-α-mediated proinflammatory markers, including intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and interleukin (IL)-6 gene expression, nitric-oxide synthase activity, and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κB, with IC50 values of only 10 to 20 pM. It is significant that proinflammatory markers can also be inhibited by (R)-DOI hours after treatment with TNF-α. With the exception of a few natural toxins, no current drugs or small molecule therapeutics demonstrate a comparable potency for any physiological effect. TNF-α-mediated inflammatory pathways have been strongly implicated in a number of diseases, including atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, type II diabetes, depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. Our results indicate that activation of 5-HT2A receptors represents a novel, and extraordinarily potent, potential therapeutic avenue for the treatment of disorders involving TNF-α-mediated inflammation. Note that because (R)-DOI can significantly inhibit the effects of TNF-α many hours after the administration of TNF-α, potential therapies could be aimed not only at preventing inflammation but also treating inflammatory injury that has already occurred or is ongoing.},

	abstract = {Classical psychedelics are psychoactive substances, which, besides their psychopharmacological activity, have also been shown to exert significant modulatory effects on immune responses by altering signaling pathways involved in inflammation, cellular proliferation, and cell survival via activating NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Recently, several neurotransmitter receptors involved in the pharmacology of psychedelics, such as serotonin and sigma-1 receptors, have also been shown to play crucial roles in numerous immunological processes. This emerging field also offers promising treatment modalities in the therapy of various diseases including autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions, infections, and cancer. However, the scarcity of available review literature renders the topic unclear and obscure, mostly posing psychedelics as illicit drugs of abuse and not as physiologically relevant molecules or as possible agents of future pharmacotherapies. In this paper, the immunomodulatory potential of classical serotonergic psychedelics, including N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine will be discussed from a perspective of molecular immunology and pharmacology. Special attention will be given to the functional interaction of serotonin and sigma-1 receptors and their cross-talk with toll-like and RIG-I-like pattern-recognition receptor-mediated signaling. Furthermore, novel approaches will be suggested feasible for the treatment of diseases with chronic inflammatory etiology and pathology, such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease.},

	abstract = {Despite its pharmacological relevance, the mechanism of the development of tolerance to the action of benzodiazepines is essentially unknown. The acute sedative action of diazepam is mediated via alpha1-GABA(A) receptors. Therefore, we tested whether chronic activation of these receptors by diazepam is sufficient to induce tolerance to its sedative action. Knock-in mice, in which thealpha1-,alpha2-,alpha3-, oralpha(5)-GABA(A) receptors had been rendered insensitive to diazepam by histidine-arginine point mutation, were chronically treated with diazepam (8 d; 15 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and tested for motor activity. Wild-type, alpha2(H101R), and alpha3(H126R) mice showed a robust diminution of the motor-depressant drug action. In contrast, alpha5(H105R) mice failed to display any sedative tolerance. alpha1(H101R) mice showed no alteration of motor activity with chronic diazepam treatment. Autoradiography with [3H]flumazenil revealed no change in benzodiazepine binding sites. However, a decrease in alpha5-subunit radioligand binding was detected selectively in the dentate gyrus with specific ligands. This alteration was observed only in diazepam-tolerant animals, indicating that the manifestation of tolerance to the sedative action of diazepam is associated with a downregulation of alpha5-GABA(A) receptors in the dentate gyrus. Thus, the chronic activation of alpha(5)-GABA(A) receptors is crucial for the normal development of sedative tolerance to diazepam, which manifests itself in conjunction with alpha1-GABA(A) receptors.},

	abstract = {Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the primary pharmacological treatment for depression, but SSRIs are effective in only half of the patients and typically take several weeks to relieve symptoms. The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine exerts a rapid antidepressant action, but has troubling side effects. We hypothesized that negative allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors would exert similar effects on brain activity as ketamine, but would not exert as many side effects if targeted only to GABAA receptors containing α5 subunits, which are enriched in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Here, we show that the α5-selective negative modulator L-655,708 reversed the alterations in hedonic behavior in the sucrose preference and social interaction tests produced by two different chronic stress paradigms in rats within 24 h of systemic administration. Similar effects were observed with another α5-selective negative modulator, MRK-016. L-655,708 had no effect on hedonic or open-field behavior in unstressed animals. Within 24 h, L-655,708 injection also restored the strength of pathologically weakened excitatory synaptic transmission at the stress-sensitive temporoammonic-CA1 synapse, measured electrophysiologically, and increased levels of the GluA1 subunit of the AMPA receptor, measured with western blotting. We suggest that the ability of L-655,708 to restore excitatory synaptic strength rapidly may underlie its ability to restore stress-induced behavioral alterations rapidly, supporting evidence that dysfunction of multiple excitatory synapses in cortico-mesolimbic reward pathways contributes, in part, to the genesis of depression. Negative allosteric modulators of α5 subunit-containing GABAA receptors represent a promising novel class of fast-acting and clinically viable antidepressant compounds.},

	abstract = {It has been recently proposed that α5-subunit containing GABAA receptors (α5-GABAA receptors) that mediate tonic inhibition might be involved in pain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the contribution of α5-GABAA receptors in the loss of GABAergic inhibition and in formalin-, Complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA)- and L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation-induced long-lasting hypersensitivity. Formalin or CFA injection and L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation produced long-lasting allodynia and hyperalgesia. Moreover, formalin injection impaired the rate-dependent depression (RDD) of the Hofmann reflex. Peripheral and intrathecal pre-treatment or post-treatment with the α5-GABAA receptor antagonist, L-655,708 (0.15–15 nmol) prevented and reversed, respectively, these long-lasting behaviors. Formalin injection increased α5-GABAA receptors mRNA expression in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) mainly at 3 days. α5-GABAA receptors were localized in the dorsal spinal cord and DRG co-labeling with NeuN, CGRP and IB4 suggesting their presence in peptidergic and non-peptidergic neurons. These receptors were found mainly in small- and medium-size neurons. Formalin injection enhanced α5-GABAA receptors fluorescence intensity in spinal cord and DRG at 3 and 6 days. Intrathecal administration of L-655,708 (15 nmol) prevented and reversed formalin-induced impairment of RDD. These results suggest that α5-GABAA receptors play a role in the loss of GABAergic inhibition and contribute to long-lasting secondary allodynia and hyperalgesia.},

attention to five disease states: cognitive dysfunction and Down syndrome,

bidirectional modulation of tonic inhibition,
α5-subunit-containing GABAA receptors permit the
bidirectional modulation of cognitive processes, and a partial inverse agonist
acting at the α5-subunit-containing GABAA receptor

disorders, the viability of nonsedative anxiolytics based on the modulation of
α2- and α3-subunit-containing

depression offers new options for antidepressant drug development, cognitive
symptoms in schizophrenia are attributed to a cortical GABAergic deficit, and
dysfunctional GABAergic inhibition is increasingly understood to contribute to
the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders.},

Often, it is seen that the primary site of infection is quite remote from the brain, but an eventual involvement of the cerebral tissue is seen to occur that becomes the cause of death of the majority of the patients. In the absence of a clear preferential reason for targeting the brain, chemicals produced by the nervous system, which have miniature concentrations in the blood, appear to set up a chemical attraction that eventually causes them to migrate to the neural tissue. We studied the possible chemicals of neural origin that can lure the parasite toward the brain, enabling them to cause meningoencephalitis. The identification of these chemicals could be of enormous prophylactic significance as blocking the chemotaxis of neurotropic parasite by antagonist drugs and chemicals can prevent cerebral infection and provide ample time to eradicate the parasites at the primary site of infection.},

	abstract = {PNU-151774E [(S)-(+)-2-(4-(3-fluorobenzyloxy)benzylamino)propanamide methanesulfonate], a new anticonvulsant that displays a wide therapeutic window, has a potency comparable or superior to that of most classic anticonvulsants. PNU-151774E is chemically unrelated to current antiepileptics. In animal seizure models it possesses a broad spectrum of action. In the present study, the action mechanism of PNU-151774E has been investigated using electrophysiological and biochemical assays. Binding studies performed with rat brain membranes show that PNU-151774E has high affinity for binding site 2 of the sodium channel receptor, which is greater than that of phenytoin or lamotrigine (IC50, 8 microM versus 47 and 185 microM, respectively). PNU-151774E reduces sustained repetitive firing in a use-dependent manner without modifying the first action potential in hippocampal cultured neurons. In the same preparation PNU-151774E inhibits tetrodotoxin-sensitive fast sodium currents and high voltage-activated calcium currents under voltage-clamp conditions. These electrophysiological activities of PNU-151774E correlate with its ability to inhibit veratrine and KCl-induced glutamate release in rat hippocampal slices (IC50, 56.4 and 185.5 microM, respectively) and calcium inward currents in mouse cortical neurons. On the other hand, PNU-151774E does not affect whole-cell gamma-aminobutryic acid- and glutamate-induced currents in cultured mouse cortical neurons. These results suggest that PNU-151774E exerts its anticonvulsant activity, at least in part, through inhibition of sodium and calcium channels, stabilizing neuronal membrane excitability and inhibiting transmitter release. The possible relevance of these pharmacological properties to its antiepileptic potential is discussed.},

This study examined whether low doses of flumazenil would improve event-related brain potential (ERP) indicators of selective attention and induce feelings of activation and anxiety in healthy men. Data from 11 men (24-30 years) who received intravenous flumazenil (0.2 mg, plus 0.3 mg 30 minutes later) and placebo were analyzed according to a double-blind crossover design. ERPs were recorded while subjects performed an auditory selective attention task. Mismatch negativity (MMN), processing negativity (PN), and the P3 component were extracted from the ERP as markers of preattentive mismatch processing, selective attention, and stimulus processing within working memory, respectively. Counting accuracy and performance on a letter cancellation test were used as behavioral indicators of attention. Mood was assessed by an adjective checklist and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Flumazenil significantly increased PN over frontocortical areas, indicating improved selective attention (p {\textless} 0.05). Increases in the P3 amplitude and MMN after drug treatment remained nonsignificant. Subjects felt more activated and extraverted after flumazenil treatment than after placebo (p {\textless} 0.05). Anxiety was not increased. The findings of this study confirm the concept that flumazenil administered at a low dose in humans exerts effects opposite to those of benzodiazepines.

	abstract = {Mu-opioid receptor agonists represent mainstays of pain management. However, the therapeutic use of these agents is associated with serious side effects, including potentially lethal respiratory depression. Accordingly, there is a longstanding interest in the development of new opioid analgesics with improved therapeutic profiles. The alkaloids of the Southeast Asian plant Mitragyna speciosa, represented by the prototypical member mitragynine, are an unusual class of opioid receptor modulators with distinct pharmacological properties. Here we describe the first receptor-level functional characterization of mitragynine and related natural alkaloids at the mu-, kappa-, and delta-opioid receptors. These results show that mitragynine and the oxidized analog 7-hydroxymitragynine, are partial agonists of the human mu-opioid receptor and competitive antagonists at the kappa- and delta-opioid receptors. We also show that mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are G-protein-biased agonists of the mu-opioid receptor, which do not recruit β-arrestin following receptor activation. Therefore, the Mitragyna alkaloid scaffold represents a novel framework for the development of functionally biased opioid modulators, which may exhibit improved therapeutic profiles. Also presented is an enantioselective total synthesis of both (-)-mitragynine and its unnatural enantiomer, (+)-mitragynine, employing a proline-catalyzed Mannich-Michael reaction sequence as the key transformation. Pharmacological evaluation of (+)-mitragynine revealed its much weaker opioid activity. Likewise, the intermediates and chemical transformations developed in the total synthesis allowed the elucidation of previously unexplored structure-activity relationships (SAR) within the Mitragyna scaffold. Molecular docking studies, in combination with the observed chemical SAR, suggest that Mitragyna alkaloids adopt a binding pose at the mu-opioid receptor that is distinct from that of classical opioids.,},

	abstract = {Current antitussive medications have limited efficacy and often contain the opiate-like agent dextromethorphan (DEX). The mechanism whereby DEX inhibits cough is ill defined. DEX displays affinity at both NMDA and sigma receptors, suggesting that the antitussive activity may involve central or peripheral activity at either of these receptors. This study examined and compared the antitussive activity of DEX and various putative sigma receptor agonists in the guinea-pig citric-acid cough model.
            
            
              Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of DEX (30 mg kg−1) and the sigma-1 agonists SKF-10,047 (1–5 mg kg−1), Pre-084 (5 mg kg−1), and carbetapentane (1–5 mg kg−1) inhibited citric-acid-induced cough in guinea-pigs. Intraperitoneal administration of a sigma-1 antagonist, BD 1047 (1–5 mg kg−1), reversed the inhibition of cough elicited by SKF-10,047. In addition, two structurally dissimilar sigma agonists SKF-10,047 (1 mg ml−1) and Pre-084 (1 mg ml−1) inhibited cough when administered by aerosol.
            
            
              Aerosolized BD 1047 (1 mg ml−1, 30 min) prevented the antitussive action of SKF-10,047 (5 mg kg−1) or DEX (30 mg kg−1) given by i.p. administration and, likewise, i.p. administration of BD 1047 (5 mg kg−1) prevented the antitussive action of SKF-10,047 given by aerosol (1 mg ml−1).
            
            
              These results therefore support the argument that antitussive effects of DEX may be mediated via sigma receptors, since both systemic and aerosol administration of sigma-1 receptor agonists inhibit citric-acid-induced cough in guinea-pigs. While significant systemic exposure is possible with aerosol administration, the very low doses administered (estimated {\textless}0.3 mg kg−1) suggest that there may be a peripheral component to the antitussive effect.},

	abstract = {Excessive or persistent proinflammatory cytokine production plays a central role in autoimmune diseases. Acute activation of the sympathetic nervous system attenuates the innate immune response. However, both the autonomic nervous system and innate immune system are regarded as systems that cannot be voluntarily influenced. Herein, we evaluated the effects of a training program on the autonomic nervous system and innate immune response. Healthy volunteers were randomized to either the intervention (n = 12) or control group (n = 12). Subjects in the intervention group were trained for 10 d in meditation (third eye meditation), breathing techniques (i.a., cyclic hyperventilation followed by breath retention), and exposure to cold (i.a., immersions in ice cold water). The control group was not trained. Subsequently, all subjects underwent experimental endotoxemia (i.v. administration of 2 ng/kg Escherichia coli endotoxin). In the intervention group, practicing the learned techniques resulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in profoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels. In the intervention group, plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased more rapidly after endotoxin administration, correlated strongly with preceding epinephrine levels, and were higher. Levels of proinflammatory mediators TNF-Î±, IL-6, and IL-8 were lower in the intervention group and correlated negatively with IL-10 levels. Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group. In conclusion, we demonstrate that voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system results in epinephrine release and subsequent suppression of the innate immune response in humans in vivo. These results could have important implications for the treatment of conditions associated with excessive or persistent inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases.},

Mice withdrawn from chronic treatment with diazepam showed a time-related evolution of anxiety, muscle rigidity, and seizures between days 4 and 21 after treatment discontinuation. A period between withdrawal days 1 and 3 was symptom-free. Surprisingly, during this "silent phase" the susceptibility of mice to alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-tert-butyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (ATPA) and kainate seizures and the magnitude of monosynaptic reflexes mediated by non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) mechanisms were enhanced. In apparent contrast, the "active phase", between withdrawal days 4 and 21, was characterized by increased susceptibility to NMDA seizures and enhanced magnitude of polysynaptic reflexes, which are NMDA dependent. Treatment of mice with alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) antagonists 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466) or 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo(f)quinoxaline but not with the NMDA antagonist 3-[(+/-)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl]-propyl-1-phosphonate (CPP) during the silent phase prevented signs of dependence. In contrast, treatment with CPP but not with GYKI 52466 during the active phase prevented the symptoms. The development of tolerance to and dependence on diazepam was prevented by concurrent treatment of mice with CPP but was not prevented by GYKI 52466. These data indicate that NMDA-dependent mechanisms contribute to the development of tolerance to diazepam and to the expression of signs of dependence in mice after termination of long-term treatment with diazepam. Nevertheless, the non-NMDA-mediated silent phase is essential for triggering the symptoms. Therefore, AMPA antagonists may offer a therapeutic approach for preventing dependence on benzodiazepines that is an alternative to NMDA antagonism.},

Salvinorin A is the main constituent and the responsible for the psychoactive effects attributed to this herb. Both S. divinorum and salvinorin A have become controlled drugs in various countries, but they are not listed in the Schedules of the United Nations Drug Conventions. Regarding the effects of the consumption of S. divinorum, almost all studies are based on in vivo or on survey-based studies and there are no studies on its toxicity in vitro. Furthermore, all studies are focused in the acute toxicological effects promoted by this plant. So, it is of utmost importance to further investigate the effects of S. divinorum and salvinorin A, particularly on in vitro models, after a prolonged time exposure. In this context, the present work evaluated the toxicity in vitro induced by S. divinorum or salvinorin A in six cell lines, through MTT assays and LC50 determination. Overall, results showed that both S. divinorum and salvinorin A are cytotoxic, dose- and time-dependent. Also, Hep G2, and, in a lesser extent, Caco 2 cells showed lower sensitivity to S. divinorum and salvinorin A, comparing to the other cells. To our knowledge, this is the first work focused on in vitro toxicity of S. divinorum and salvinorin A using a variety of cell lines, extensively described in literature and widely used in a variety of in vitro studies.},

It has been observed that chronic exposure to drugs of abuse produces molecular and cellular adaptations in ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons, mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These BDNF-induced adaptations in the VTA are associated with the establishment of aversive withdrawal motivation that leads to a drug-dependent state. Growing evidence suggests that 5-HT2A receptor signaling can regulate the expression of BDNF in the brain. In this study, we observed that a single systemic or intra-VTA administration of a 5-HT2A agonist in rats and mice blocks both the aversive conditioned response to drug withdrawal and the mechanism responsible for switching from a drug-naive to a drug-dependent motivational system. Our results suggest that 5-HT2A agonists could be used as therapeutic agents to reverse a drug dependent state, as well as inhibiting the aversive effects produced by drug withdrawal.},

To determine the safety and feasibility of psilocybin as an adjunct to tobacco smoking cessation treatment we conducted an open-label pilot study administering moderate (20mg/70kg) and high (30mg/70kg) doses of psilocybin within a structured 15-week smoking cessation treatment protocol. Participants were 15 psychiatrically healthy nicotine-dependent smokers (10 males; mean age of 51 years), with a mean of 6 previous lifetime quit attempts, and smoking a mean of 19 cigarettes per day for a mean of 31 years at intake. Biomarkers assessing smoking status, and self-report measures of smoking behavior demonstrated that 12 of 15 participants (80\%) showed seven-day point prevalence abstinence at 6-month follow-up. The observed smoking cessation rate substantially exceeds rates commonly reported for other behavioral and/or pharmacological therapies (typically {\textless}35\%). Although the open-label design does not allow for definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of psilocybin, these findings suggest psilocybin may be a potentially efficacious adjunct to current smoking cessation treatment models. The present study illustrates a framework for future research on the efficacy and mechanisms of hallucinogen-facilitated treatment of addiction.},

These results raised the proposal that these drugs may act as 5-HT2 antagonists.
            
            
              To test this hypothesis, Xenopus laevis oocytes were microinjected with the rat clones for 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors. The above-mentioned PEAs and its 4-H analog (2C-H) blocked the 5-HT-induced currents at 5-HT2A, but not at the 5-HT2C receptor, revealing 5-HT2 receptor subtype selectivity. The 5-HT2A receptor antagonism required a 2-min preincubation to attain maximum inhibition.
            
            
              All PEAs tested shifted the 5-HT concentration–response curves to the right and downward. Their potencies varied with the nature of the C(4) substituent; the relative rank order of their 5-HT2A receptor antagonist potency was 2C-I{\textgreater}2C-B{\textgreater}2C-D{\textgreater}2C-H.
            
            
              The present results demonstrate that in X. laevis oocytes, a series of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-substituted PEAs blocked the 5-HT2A but not the 5-HT2C receptor-mediated responses. As an alternative hypothesis, we suggest that the psychostimulant activity of the PEAs may not be exclusively associated with partial or full 5-HT2A receptor agonism.},

It produces serious adverse effects, but its pharmacological profile is not well recognized. In vitro data have shown that 5-MeO-DIPT acts as a potent serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibitor and displays high affinity at serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors. In this study, using microdialysis in freely moving rats, we examined the effect of 5-MeO-DIPT on dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and glutamate release in the rat striatum, nucleus accumbens, and frontal cortex. In search of a possible neurotoxic effect of 5-MeO-DIPT, we measured DA and 5-HT tissue content in the above rat brain regions and also determined the oxidative DNA damage with the comet assay. Moreover, we tested drug-elicited head-twitch response and a forepaw treading induced by 8-OH-DPAT. 5-MeO-DIPT at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg increased extracellular DA, 5-HT, and glutamate level but the differences in the potency were found between brain regions. 5-MeO-DIPT increased 5-HT and decreased 5-HIAA tissue content which seems to result from SERT inhibition. On the other hand, a decrease in DA, DOPAC, and HVA tissue contents suggests possible adaptive changes in DA turnover or damage of DA terminals by 5-MeO-DIPT. DNA single and double-strand breaks persisted up to 60 days after the treatment, indicating marked neurotoxicity of 5-MeO-DIPT. The induction of head-twitch response and potentiation of forepaw treading induced by 8-OH-DPAT indicate that hallucinogenic activity seems to be mediated through the stimulation of 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors by 5-MeO-DIPT.},

Diazepam (1 nM-1 mM) in the presence of GABA (1 microM) modulated [(3)H]TBOB binding to control and flumazenil pretreated cells according to a two-site model. No significant differences between the groups were observed in either the potency or efficacy of diazepam to modulate [(3)H]TBOB binding, as evidenced by a lack of significant changes between their IC(50) and I(max) values.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to further elucidate the mechanisms involved in adaptive changes of GABA(A) receptors following prolonged exposure to flumazenil, the antagonist of benzodiazepine binding sites on GABA(A) receptors. The effects of prolonged flumazenil treatment were studied on recombinant alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A) receptors stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells. Using radioligand binding experiments we found enhancement in the maximum number of [(3)H]muscimol labeled binding sites in different preparations of HEK 293 cells. The parallel increase of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding sites in the membranes was reduced in the presence of actinomycin D and cycloheximide, inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis, respectively. Chronic flumazenil also raised the steady-state level of mRNA encoding alpha(1) receptor subunit. The results suggest that the up-regulation of GABA(A) receptors, observed after prolonged flumazenil treatment is at least partly due to increased de novo synthesis of receptor proteins at both transcriptional and translational level.},

Although safe, tolerance develops rapidly to their sedative activity and more slowly to their anticonvulsant activity. In animals anxiolytic tolerance has also been measured. Abrupt cessation of benzodiazepine treatment leads to symptoms of withdrawal. The mechanisms responsible for these phenomena are not known. Benzodiazepines act via GABA(A) receptors, but do not appear to produce tolerance and dependence by simple downregulation of receptor number. GABA(A) receptors are hetero-oligomers comprised of multiple subunits encoded by a multigene family. The molecular effects of long-term benzodiazepine exposure are reviewed and a model is presented that draws on results from a number of research groups working in this area.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose:
Illegal ‘ecstasy' tablets frequently contain 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-like compounds of unknown pharmacological activity. Since monoamine transporters are one of the primary targets of MDMA action in the brain, a number of MDMA analogues have been tested for their ability to inhibit [3H]noradrenaline uptake into rat PC12 cells expressing the noradrenaline transporter (NET) and [3H]5-HT uptake into HEK293 cells stably transfected with the 5-HT transporter (SERT).

Experimental approach:
Concentration–response curves for the following compounds at both NET and SERT were determined under saturating substrate conditions: 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-hydroxyamphetamine (MDOH), 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenylethylamine (2CB), 3,4-dimethoxymethamphetamine (DMMA), 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-butanamine (BDB), 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-N-methyl-2-butanamine (MBDB) and 2,3-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (2,3-MDMA).

Key results:
2,3-MDMA was significantly less potent than MDMA at SERT, but equipotent with MDMA at NET. 2CB and BDB were both significantly less potent than MDMA at NET, but equipotent with MDMA at SERT. MBDB, DMMA, MDOH and the MDMA metabolites HMA and HMMA, were all significantly less potent than MDMA at both NET and SERT.

Conclusions and implications:
This study provides an important insight into the structural requirements of MDMA analogue affinity at both NET and SERT. It is anticipated that these results will facilitate understanding of the likely pharmacological actions of structural analogues of MDMA.},

Higher doses of ALEPH-2, in the range exhibiting anxiolytic properties (4mg/kg), elicited significant hypothermia in mice. The affinity of the drug for 5-HT2A/2C receptors ([3H]ketanserin sites) was in the nanomolar range (Ki = 173 nM), whereas for 5-HT1A, benzodiazepine sites, and GABAA receptors, the affinity was micromolar of lower.

Addictive drugs increase the levels of dopamine and also trigger long-lasting synaptic adaptations in the mesolimbic reward system that ultimately may induce the pathological behavior. The neural basis for the addictive nature of benzodiazepines however remains elusive. Here we show that benzodiazepines increase firing of dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area through the positive modulation of GABAA receptors in nearby interneurons. Such disinhibition, which relies on α1-containing GABAARs expressed in these cells, triggers drug-evoked synaptic plasticity in excitatory afferents onto dopamine neurons and underlies drug reinforcement. Taken together, our data provide evidence that benzodiazepines share defining pharmacological features of addictive drugs through cell type-specific expression of α1-containing GABAARs in the ventral tegmental area. The data also suggest that subunitselective benzodiazepines sparing α1 may be devoid of addiction liability.},

A prolonged and combined use of these substances can alter normal brain wiring in different ways depending on the consumed cocktail mixture. Brain connectivity alterations and their change with time can be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) because of its spatial and temporal content. Here, we estimated dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) as derived from fMRI data to investigate the effects of single or combined use of alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis. Data from 534 samples were grouped according to their substance use combination as controls (CTR), smokers (SMK), drinkers (DRN), smoking-and-drinking subjects (SAD), marijuana users (MAR), smoking-and-marijuana users (SAM), marijuana-and-drinking users (MAD), and users of all three substances (ALL). The DRN group tends to exhibit decreased connectivity mainly in areas of sensorial and motor control, a result supported by the dFNC outcome and the alcohol use disorder identification test. This trend dominated the SAD group and in a weaker manner MAD and ALL. Nicotine consumers were characterized by an increment of connectivity between dorsal striatum and sensorimotor areas. Where possible, common and separate effects were identified and characterized by the analysis of dFNC data. Results also suggest that a combination of cannabis and nicotine have more contrasting effects on the brain than a single use of any of these substances. On the other hand, marijuana and alcohol might follow an additive effect trend. We concluded that all of the substances have an impact on brain connectivity, but the effect differs depending on the dFNC state analyzed.},

Although it is known that METH dysregulates both dopamine transmission and dopamine reuptake, the specific mechanism of action remains obscure. One promising target of METH is the sigma receptor, a chaperone protein located on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, we show that METH-enhancement of evoked dopamine release and basal efflux is dependent on sigma receptor activation. METH-induced activation of sigma receptors results in oxidation of a cysteine residue on VMAT2, which decreases transporter function. Unilateral injections of the sigma receptor antagonist BD-1063 prior to METH administration increased dopamine-related ipsilateral circling behavior, indicating the involvement of sigma receptors. These findings suggest that interactions between METH and the sigma receptor lead to oxidative species (most likely superoxide) that in turn oxidize VMAT2. Altogether, these findings show that the sigma receptor has a key role in METH dysregulation of dopamine release and dopamine-related behaviors.},

	abstract = {Introduction: It is a basic principle of the ‘psychedelic’ treatment model that the quality of the acute experience mediates long-term improvements in mental health. In the present paper we sought to test this using data from a clinical trial assessing psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In line with previous reports, we hypothesized that the occurrence and magnitude of Oceanic Boundlessness (OBN) (sharing features with mystical-type experience) and Dread of Ego Dissolution (DED) (similar to anxiety) would predict long-term positive outcomes, whereas sensory perceptual effects would not. Material and Methods: Twenty patients with treatment resistant depression underwent treatment with psilocybin (two separate sessions: 10mg and 25mg psilocybin). The Altered States of Consciousness (ASC) questionnaire was used to assess the quality of experiences in the 25mg psilocybin session. From the ASC, the dimensions OBN and DED were used to measure the mystical-type and challenging experiences, respectively. The Self-Reported Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR) at 5 weeks served as the endpoint clinical outcome measure, as in later time points some of the subjects had gone on to receive new treatments, thus confounding inferences. In a repeated measure ANOVA, Time was the within-subject factor (independent variable), with QIDS-SR as the within-subject dependent variable in baseline, 1-day, 1-week, 5-weeks. OBN and DED were independent variables. OBN-by-time and DED-by-time interactions were the primary outcomes of interest. Results: For the interaction of OBN and DED with Time (QIDS-SR as dependent variable), the main effect and the effects at each time point compared to baseline were all significant (p = 0.002 and p = 0.003, respectively, for main effects), confirming our main hypothesis. Furthermore, Pearson’s correlation of OBN with QIDS-SR (5 weeks) was specific compared to perceptual dimensions of the ASC (p {\textless} 0.05). Discussion: This report further bolsters the view that the quality of the acute psychedelic experience is a key mediator of long-term changes in mental health. More specifically, future therapeutic work with psychedelics may consider investigating ways which enhance mystical-type experience and reduce anxiety, given the growing evidence that this serves the efficacy of the treatment model.},

	abstract = {The vast majority of states have enacted full or partial medical marijuana (MMJ) programs, causing the number of patients seeking certification for MMJ use to increase dramatically in recent years. Despite increased use of MMJ across the nation, no studies thus far have examined the specific impact of MMJ on cognitive function and related brain activation. In the present study, MMJ patients seeking treatment for a variety of documented medical conditions were assessed prior to initiating MMJ treatment and after three months of treatment as part of a larger longitudinal study. In order to examine the effect of MMJ treatment on task-related brain activation, MMJ patients completed the Multi-Source Interference Test (MSIT) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We also collected data regarding conventional medication use, clinical state, and health-related measures at each visit. Following three months of treatment, MMJ patients demonstrated improved task performance accompanied by changes in brain activation patterns within the cingulate cortex and frontal regions. Interestingly, after MMJ treatment, brain activation patterns appeared more similar to those exhibited by healthy controls from previous studies than at pre-treatment, suggestive of a potential normalization of brain function relative to baseline. These findings suggest that MMJ use may result in different effects relative to recreational MJ use, as recreational consumers have been shown to exhibit decrements in task performance accompanied by altered brain activation. Moreover, patients in the current study also reported improvements in clinical state and health-related measures as well as notable decreases in prescription medication use, particularly opiates and benzodiapezines after three months of treatment. Further research is needed to clarify the specific neurobiologic impact, clinical efficacy and unique effects of MMJ for a range of indications and how it compares to recreational MJ use.},

Finally, in a recently developed model of anxiety and memory, the elevated T-maze, the doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg ALEPH-2 did not change inhibitory avoidance of the open arms. Nevertheless, the highest dose had an amnestic effect on this task, repeated 72 h later in the absence of drug. In addition, this dose significantly increased the latency to escape from the open arms and had an amnestic effect measured 72 h later. Overall, these results indicate that ALEPH-2 possesses anxiolytic, amnestic as well as sedative and/or motor depressant actions.},

A double-blind randomized trial compared the efficacy of Passiflora incarnata extract with oxazepam in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Methods: The study was performed on 36 out-patients diagnosed with GAD using DSM IV criteria. Patients were allocated in a random fashion: 18 to the Passiflora extract 45 drops/day plus placebo tablet group, and 18 to oxazepam 30 mg/day plus placebo drops for a 4-week trial. Results: Passiflora extract and oxazepam were effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. No significant difference was observed between the two protocols at the end of trial. Oxazepam showed a rapid onset of action. On the other hand, significantly more problems relating to impairment of job performance were encountered with subjects on oxazepam. Conclusion: The results suggest that Passiflora extract is an effective drug for the management of generalized anxiety disorder, and the low incidence of impairment of job performance with Passiflora extract compared to oxazepam is an advantage. A large-scale trial is justified.},

Apigenin is the result of post-harvest processes converting apigenin 7-glycoside and its derivatives into the aglycone. The different apigenin/apigenin 7-glycoside ratios reported in the literature for various chamomile samples can easily be explained as the result of different post-harvest conditions. The accumulation of free apigenin in chamomile flowers must be ascribed to the enzymatic degradation of apigenin 7-glycoside and other glycosidic derivatives of apigenin. Thus, the selection of chamomile types yielding large amounts of apigenin seems to be based on a degradation product.},

Aim. To test the effectiveness of administering oxytocin in a case of treatment-resistant anorgasmia.
Methods. The patient underwent a biopsychosocial evaluation by a psychiatrist trained in sexual medicine and sex therapy for male orgasmic disorder, acquired type. Medical conditions, effect of substances, and psychological issues were ruled out. The patient was properly consented to using oxytocin as an off-label trial. Oxytocin was administered using a nasal spray intracoitally because of its ultra-short half-life.
Results. Oxytocin was effective in restoring ejaculation.
Conclusions. A case of treatment-resistant male anorgasmia was successfully treated with intracoital administration of intranasal oxytocin. Ishak WW, Berman DS, and Peters A. Male anorgasmia treated with oxytocin. J Sex Med 2008;5:1022â€“1024.},

	abstract = {Objective This study aimed to longitudinally investigate whether ever having used a psychedelic drug can have a protective effect on incidence of suicidality among marginalised women.
Design Longitudinal community-based cohort study.
Setting Data were drawn from a prospective, community-based cohort of marginalised women in Metro Vancouver, Canada.
Participants 766 women completed the baseline questionnaire between January 2010 and August 2014. Participants who did not report suicidality at baseline and who completed at least one follow-up visit were included.
Main outcome measure Extended Cox regression was used to model predictors of new suicidality (suicide ideation or attempts) over 54-month follow-up.
Results Nearly half (46\%; n=355) of participants reported prior suicidality and were thus excluded from the present analyses. Of 290 women eligible at baseline, 11\% (n=31) reported recent suicidality during follow-up, with an incidence density of 4.42 per 100 person-years (95\% CI 3.10 to 6.30). In multivariable analysis, reported lifetime psychedelic drug use was associated with a 60\% reduced hazard for suicidality (adjusted HR (AHR) 0.40; 95\% CI 0.17 to 0.94). Crystal methamphetamine use (AHR 3.25; 95\% CI 1.47 to 7.21) and childhood abuse (AHR 3.54; 95\% CI 1.49 to 8.40) remained independent predictors of suicidality.
Conclusion The high rate of suicidality identified in this study is of major concern. Alongside emerging evidence on the potential of psychedelic-assisted therapy to treat some mental illness and addiction issues, our findings demonstrate that naturalistic psychedelic drug use is independently associated with reduced suicidality, while other illicit drug use and childhood trauma predispose women to suicidality. While observational, this study supports calls for further investigation of the therapeutic utility of psychedelic drugs in treating poor mental health and promoting mental wellness.},

	abstract = {Many patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) experience inadequate symptom relief from available treatments. Ketamine is a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist with a potentially novel mechanism of action for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Therefore, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 18 adults with DSM-5 SAD and compared the effects between intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) and placebo (normal saline) on social phobia symptoms. Ketamine and placebo infusions were administered in a random order with a 28-day washout period between infusions. Ratings of anxiety were assessed 3-h post-infusion and followed for 14 days. We used linear mixed models to assess the impact of ketamine and placebo on anxiety symptoms. Outcomes were blinded ratings on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and self-reported anxiety on a visual analog scale (VAS-Anxiety). We also used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the proportion of treatment responders. Based on prior studies, we defined response as a greater than 35\% LSAS reduction and 50\% VAS-Anxiety reduction. We found ketamine resulted in a significantly greater reduction in anxiety relative to placebo on the LSAS (Time × Treatment: F9,115=2.6, p=0.01) but not the VAS-Anxiety (Time × Treatment: F10,141=0.4, p=0.95). Participants were significantly more likely to exhibit a treatment response after ketamine infusion relative to placebo in the first 2 weeks following infusion measured on the LSAS (33.33\% response ketamine vs 0\% response placebo, Wilcoxon signed-rank test z=2.24, p=0.025) and VAS (88.89\% response ketamine vs 52.94\% response placebo, Wilcoxon signed-rank test z=2.12, p=0.034). In conclusion, this proof-of-concept trial provides initial evidence that ketamine may be effective in reducing anxiety.},

How exercise intensity and concomitant effective changes affect central opioidergic responses is unknown. We studied the effects of acute physical exercise on the cerebral μ-opioid receptors (MOR) of 22 healthy recreationally active males using positron emission tomography (PET) and the MOR-selective radioligand [11C]carfentanil. MOR binding was measured in three conditions on separate days: after a 60-min aerobic moderate-intensity exercise session, after a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session, and after rest. Mood was measured repeatedly throughout the experiment. HIIT significantly decreased MOR binding selectively in the frontolimbic regions involved in pain, reward, and emotional processing (thalamus, insula, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex). Decreased binding correlated with increased negative emotionality. Moderate-intensity exercise did not change MOR binding, although increased euphoria correlated with decreased receptor binding. These observations, consistent with endogenous opioid release, highlight the role of the μ-opioid system in mediating affective responses to high-intensity training as opposed to recreational moderate physical exercise.},

Although men are more likely to endorse past month cannabis use and are more frequently diagnosed with Cannabis Use Disorder relative to women, a growing proportion of medical cannabis users are reported to be women. The increased popularity of cannabis for medical purposes and the narrowing gap in prevalence of use between men and women raises questions regarding sex-dependent effects related to therapeutic efficacy and negative health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids. The objective of this review is to provide a translational perspective on the sex-dependent effects of cannabis and cannabinoids by synthesizing findings from preclinical and clinical studies focused on sex comparisons of their therapeutic potential and abuse liability, two specific areas that are of significant public health relevance. Hormonal and pharmacological mechanisms that may underlie sex differences in the effects of cannabis and cannabinoids are highlighted.},

There has been growing attention in recent years on its potential therapeutic efficacy as municipalities and legislative bodies in the United States, Canada, and other countries grapple with enacting policy to facilitate the use of cannabis or its constituents for medical purposes. There are {\textgreater}550 chemical compounds and {\textgreater}100 phytocannabinoids isolated from cannabis, including Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is thought to produce the main psychoactive effects of cannabis, while CBD does not appear to have similar effects. Studies conflict as to whether CBD attenuates or exacerbates the behavioral and cognitive effects of THC. This includes effects of CBD on THC-induced anxiety, psychosis, and cognitive deficits. In this article, we review the available evidence on the pharmacology and behavioral interactions of THC and CBD from preclinical and human studies, particularly with reference to anxiety and psychosis-like symptoms. Both THC and CBD, as well as other cannabinoid molecules, are currently being evaluated for medicinal purposes, separately and in combination. Future cannabis-related policy decisions should include consideration of scientific findings, including the individual and interactive effects of CBD and THC.},

The current state of pharmacology research for CUD highlights the need to consider particular characteristics of patients, such as gender, impulsivity, and severity of cannabis use, when selecting a medication in the off-label treatment of CUD or cannabis withdrawal. As a field, the body of work also exposes some areas in need of improvement in study design, selection of outcome measures, interpretation of results, and the overall process of evaluating candidate medications. Coming to a consensus as a field and addressing these gaps in future research will likely lend itself to further advances in improving the lives of patients with CUD.},

We found that the mitochondrial genome was down-regulated after acute cocaine injection. Hydroperoxide and lipid peroxide generation was correlated with an increase in mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide generation and with a reduced functioning of mitochondrial complex I in response to cocaine. As judged from the measurement of caspase-3 activity and TUNEL labeling, neither acute nor chronic cocaine treatment has been found to induce apoptosis in any of the structures examined. This differs dramatically from what has been described for methamphetamine. Cocaine-induced radical formation was accompanied by the induction of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, after both acute and chronic cocaine treatment. In addition, proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity was enhanced following a single cocaine injection in both cortex and striatum. It is proposed that the compensatory mechanisms to oxidative stress occurring in response to cocaine were effective in scavenging reactive oxygen species and in preventing subsequent cellular damage, thus explaining why no significant cell death was found in these brain structures.},

Physiological concentrations of zinc were inhibitory to mu receptor binding, whereas the delta and kappa receptors were relatively insensitive to this inhibition. Scatchard analysis, using these opioid agonists, revealed curvilinear plots; concentrations of zinc equal to or less than the IC50 (the concentration of cation which caused 50\% inhibition of the binding of opioid ligand to its receptor), increased the KD (the dissociation constant) of all three subtypes of receptor, with no effect on the Bmax (the maximum number of binding sites) and abolished the high affinity sites of the delta and kappa receptors. Copper, cadmium and mercury also inhibited the binding of these ligands to their receptors. Histidine was most effective in preventing the inhibitory effects of zinc and copper, whereas it was less effective on cadmium and without any effect on the inhibition caused by mercury. Magnesium and manganese were stimulatory to opioid receptor binding, whereas cobalt and nickel had dual (stimulatory and inhibitory) effects. Non-inhibitory concentrations of zinc significantly decreased the stimulatory effects of magnesium and manganese on the mu and delta receptors, suggesting that part of the effect of zinc was through prevention of the actions of stimulatory cations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Thus, it has been suggested that analgesic actions of morphine are produced via the mu opioid receptor, despite its ability to bind to kappa and delta receptors in vitro. However, it is not clear whether the results of these studies reflect the effect of morphine in the spinal cord. In the present study, we report study of the analgesic actions of spinally-administered morphine and other opioid receptor agonists in mu opioid receptor knockout and wild type mice. Morphine produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect in the tail flick test in the knockout mice, although higher doses were needed to produce antinociception than in wild type mice. The antinociceptive effect of morphine was completely blocked by naloxone (a non-selective opioid antagonist) and nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI, a selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist), but not by naltrindole (a selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist). U-50,488H (a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist) also produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect in knockout mice but presented lower analgesic potency in knockout mice than in wild type mice. Analgesic effects of [d-Pen2,d-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE, a selective delta-opioid receptor agonist) were observed in wild type mice but abolished in knockout mice. SNC80 (a selective delta-opioid receptor agonist) was not antinociceptive even in wild type mice. The present study demonstrated that morphine can produce thermal antinociception via the kappa opioid receptor in the spinal cord in the absence of the mu opioid receptor. Lower potency of U50,488H in mu opioid receptor knockout mice suggests interaction between kappa and mu opioid receptors at the spinal level.},

	abstract = {Morphine and several other opioids are important drugs for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Opioid-induced analgesia is predominantly mediated by the μ-opioid receptor (MOR). When administered to humans, complex metabolic pathways lead to generation of many metabolites, nine of which may be considered major metabolites. While the properties of the two main compounds, morphine-6-glucuronide and morphine-3-glucuronide, are well described, the activity of other morphine metabolites is largely unknown. Here we performed an extensive pharmacological characterization by comparing efficacies and potencies of morphine and its nine major metabolites for the two main signaling pathways engaged by the human MOR, which occur via G(i)-protein activation and β-arrestins, respectively. We used radioligand binding studies and FRET-based methods to monitor MOR-mediated G(i)-protein activation and β-arrestin recruitment in single intact 293T cells. This approach identified two major groups of morphine metabolites, which we classified into "strong" and "weak" receptor ligands. Strong partial agonists morphine, morphine-6-glucuronide, normorphine, morphine-6-sulfate, 6-acetylmorphine and 3-acetylmorphine showed efficacies in the nanomolar range, while the weak metabolites morphine-N-oxide, morphine-3-sulfate, morphine-3-glucuronide and pseudomorphine activated MOR pathways only in the micromolar range. Interestingly, three metabolites, normorphine, 6-acetylmorphine and morphine-6-glucuronide, had lower potencies for Gi-protein activation but higher potencies and efficacies for β-arrestin recruitment than morphine itself, suggesting that they are biased towards β-arrestin pathways.},

	abstract = {How do antidepressants elicit an antidepressant response? Here, we review accumulating evidence that the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serves as a transducer, acting as the link between the antidepressant drug and the neuroplastic changes that result in the improvement of the depressive symptoms. Over the last decade several studies have consistently highlighted BDNF as a key player in antidepressant action. An increase in hippocampal and cortical expression of BDNF mRNA parallels the antidepressant-like response of conventional antidepressants such as SSRIs. Subsequent studies showed that a single bilateral infusion of BDNF into the ventricles or directly into the hippocampus is sufficient to induce a relatively rapid and sustained antidepressant-like effect. Importantly, the antidepressant-like response to conventional antidepressants is attenuated in mice where the BDNF signaling has been disrupted by genetic manipulations. Low dose ketamine, which has been found to induce a rapid antidepressant effect in patients with treatment-resistant depression, is also dependent on increased BDNF signaling. Ketamine transiently increases BDNF translation in hippocampus, leading to enhanced synaptic plasticity and synaptic strength. Ketamine has been shown to increase BDNF translation by blocking NMDA receptor activity at rest, thereby inhibiting calcium influx and subsequently halting eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase leading to a desuppression of protein translation, including BDNF translation. The antidepressant-like response of ketamine is abolished in BDNF and TrkB conditional knockout mice, eEF2 kinase knockout mice, in mice carrying the BDNF met/met allele, and by intra-cortical infusions of BDNF-neutralizing antibodies. In summary, current data suggests that conventional antidepressants and ketamine mediate their antidepressant-like effects by increasing BDNF in forebrain regions, in particular the hippocampus, making BDNF an essential determinant of antidepressant efficacy.},

	abstract = {Clandestine chemists synthesize novel stimulant drugs by exploiting structural templates known to target monoamine transporters for dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin (DAT, NET, and SERT, respectively). 4-Methylamphetamine (4-MA) is an emerging drug of abuse that interacts with transporters, but limited structureâ€“activity data are available for its analogs. Here we employed uptake and release assays in rat brain synaptosomes, voltage-clamp current measurements in cells expressing transporters, and calcium flux assays in cells coexpressing transporters and calcium channels to study the effects of increasing N-alkyl chain length of 4-MA on interactions at DAT, NET, and SERT. In addition, we performed intracranial self-stimulation in rats to understand how the chemical modifications affect abuse liability. All 4-MA analogs inhibited uptake at DAT, NET, and SERT, but lengthening the amine substituent from methyl to ethyl, propyl, and butyl produced a stepwise decrease in potency. N-methyl 4-MA was an efficacious substrate-type releaser at DAT that evoked an inward depolarizing current and calcium influx, whereas other analogs did not exhibit these effects. N-methyl and N-ethyl 4-MA were substrates at NET, whereas N-propyl and N-butyl 4-MA were not. All analogs acted as SERT substrates, though N-butyl 4-MA had very weak effects. Intracranial self-stimulation in rats showed that elongating the N-alkyl chain decreased abuse-related effects in vivo that appeared to parallel reductions in DAT activity. Overall, converging lines of evidence show that lengthening the N-alkyl substituent of 4-MA reduces potency to inhibit transporters, eliminates substrate activity at DAT and NET, and decreases abuse liability of the compounds.},

	abstract = {3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) increases sociality in humans and animals. Release of serotonin (5-HT) is thought to have an important role in the increase in social behaviors, but the mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. Despite the advantages of nonhuman primate models, no studies have examined the mechanisms of the social effects of MDMA in nonhuman primates. The behavior and vocalizations of four group-housed squirrel monkeys were examined following administration of MDMA, its enantiomers, and methamphetamine. 5-HT receptor antagonists and agonists were given as drug pretreatments. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. MDMA and its enantiomers increased affiliative social behaviors and vocalizations, whereas methamphetamine had only modest effects on affiliative behaviors. Pretreatment with a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist and a 5-HT2C receptor agonist attenuated the MDMA-induced increase in social behaviors, while a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist did not alter affiliative vocalizations and increased MDMA-induced social contact. Nonhuman primates show MDMA-specific increases in affiliative social behaviors following MDMA administration, in concordance with human and rodent studies. MDMA-induced increases in social behaviors are 5-HT2A, but not 5-HT1A, receptor dependent. Understanding the neurochemical mechanisms mediating the prosocial effects of MDMA could help in the development of novel therapeutics with the unique social effects of MDMA but fewer of its limitations.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose:
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, accumulates in adipose tissue where it is stored for long periods of time. Here we investigated whether conditions that promote lipolysis can liberate THC from adipocytes to yield increased blood levels of THC.

Experimental approach:
In vitro studies involved freshly isolated rat adipocytes that were incubated with THC before exposure to the lipolytic agent adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). A complementary in vivo approach examined the effects of both food deprivation and ACTH on blood levels of THC in rats that had been repeatedly injected with THC (10 mg·kg−1) for 10 consecutive days. Lipolysis promoted by ACTH or food deprivation was indexed by measurement of glycerol levels.

Key results:
ACTH increased THC levels in the medium of THC-pretreated adipocytes in vitro. ACTH also enhanced THC release from adipocytes in vitro when taken from rats repeatedly pretreated with THC in vivo. Finally, in vivo ACTH exposure and 24 h food deprivation both enhanced the levels of THC and its metabolite, (-)-11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) in the blood of rats that had been pre-exposed to repeated THC injections.

Conclusions and implications:
The present study shows that lipolysis enhances the release of THC from fat stores back into blood. This suggests the likelihood of ‘reintoxication’ whereby food deprivation or stress may raise blood THC levels in animals chronically exposed to the drug. Further research will need to confirm whether this can lead to functional effects, such as impaired cognitive function or ‘flashbacks’.},

For all subjects, the mean excretion time was 27 days. Subject excretion patterns were clearly biphasic, with initial higher rates of excretion not sustained. During the subsequent period of leveling off, most subjects had one or more separate sequences of cannabinoid-negative urine test results, lasting a mean of 3 days each and followed by at least one positive result.

The main analytes for cannabis testing include the primary psychoactive constituent, Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), equipotent 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) and inactive 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THCCOOH). Eleven adult chronic frequent cannabis smokers resided on a closed research unit with unlimited access to 5.9\% THC cannabis cigarettes from 12:00 to 23:00 during two ad libitum smoking phases, followed by a 5-day abstinence period in seven participants. A single cigarette was smoked under controlled topography on the last day of the smoking and abstinence phases. Plasma cannabinoids were quantified by two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Median plasma maximum concentrations (Cmax) were 28.3 (THC), 3.9 (11-OH-THC) and 47.0 μg/L (THCCOOH) 0.5 h after controlled single cannabis smoking. Median Cmax 0.2-0.5 h after ad libitum smoking was higher for all analytes: 83.5 (THC), 14.2 (11-OH-THC) and 155 μg/L (THCCOOH). All 11 participants' plasma samples were THC and THCCOOH-positive, 58.3\% had THC ≥5 μg/L and 79.2\% were 11-OH-THC-positive 8.1-14 h after last cannabis smoking. Cannabinoid detection rates in seven participants 106-112 h (4-5 days) after last smoking were 92.9 (THC), 35.7 (11-OH-THC) and 100\% (THCCOOH), with limits of quantification of 0.5 μg/L for THC and THCCOOH, and 1.0 μg/L for 11-OH-THC. These data greatly expand prior research findings on cannabinoid excretion profiles in chronic frequent cannabis smokers during ad libitum smoking. Smoking multiple cannabis cigarettes led to higher Cmax and AUC compared with smoking a single cigarette. The chronic frequent cannabis smokers exhibited extended detection windows for plasma cannabinoids, reflecting a large cannabinoid body burden.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cannabis and caffeine are two of the most widely used psychoactive substances. Δ(9) -Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, induces deficits in short-term memory. Caffeine, a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist, attenuates some memory deficits, but there have been few studies addressing the effects of caffeine and THC in combination. Here, we evaluate the effects of these drugs using a rodent model of working memory.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rats were given THC (0, 1 and 3 mg·kg(-1) , i.p.) along with caffeine (0, 1, 3 and 10 mg·kg(-1) , i.p.), the selective adenosine A(1) -receptor antagonist CPT (0, 3 and 10 mg·kg(-1) ) or the selective adenosine A(2A) -receptor antagonist SCH58261 (0 and 5 mg·kg(-1) ) and were tested with a delayed non-matching-to-position procedure in which behaviour during the delay was automatically recorded as a model of memory rehearsal.
KEY RESULTS: THC alone produced memory deficits at 3 mg·kg(-1) . The initial exposure to caffeine (10 mg·kg(-1) ) disrupted the established pattern of rehearsal-like behaviour, but tolerance developed rapidly to this effect. CPT and SCH58261 alone had no significant effects on rehearsal or memory. When a subthreshold dose of THC (1 mg·kg(-1) ) was combined with caffeine (10 mg·kg(-1) ) or CPT (10 mg·kg(-1) ), memory performance was significantly impaired, even though performance of the rehearsal-like pattern was not significantly altered.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Caffeine did not counteract memory deficits induced by THC but actually exacerbated them. These results are consistent with recent findings that adenosine A(1) receptors modulate cannabinoid signalling in the hippocampus.

	abstract = {Maladaptive plasticity can be defined as behavioral loss or even development of disease symptoms resulting from aberrant plasticity changes in the human brain. Hyperkinetic movement disorders, either in the neurological or psychiatric realms, have been associated with maladaptive neural plasticity that can be expressed by functional changes such as an increase in transmitter release, receptor regulation and synaptic plasticity or anatomical modifications such as axonal regeneration, sprouting, synaptogenesis and neurogenesis. Recent evidence from human and animal models provided support to the hypothesis that these phenomena likely depend upon altered dopamine turnover induced by long-term drug treatment. However, it is still unclear how and where these altered mechanisms of cortical plasticity may be localized. The current article will provide an up-to-date overview of these issues together with some reflections on future studies in the field, particularly focusing on two specific disorders (levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients and tardive dyskinesias in schizophrenic patients) where the modern neuroimaging approaches have recently provided new fundamental insights.},

	abstract = {Trace amines (TAs), endogenous amino acid metabolites that are structurally similar to the biogenic amines, are endogenous ligands for trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a GPCR that modulates dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic activity. Selective TAAR1 full and partial agonists exhibit similar pro-cognitive, antidepressant- and antipsychotic-like properties in rodents and non-human primates, suggesting TAAR1 as a novel target for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We previously reported that TAAR1 partial agonists are wake-promoting in rats and mice, and that TAAR1 knockout (KO) and overexpressing mice exhibit altered sleep-wake and EEG spectral composition. Here, we report that locomotor and EEG spectral responses to the psychostimulants modafinil and caffeine are attenuated in TAAR1 KO mice. TAAR1 KO mice and WT littermates were instrumented for EEG and EMG recording and implanted with telemetry transmitters for monitoring locomotor activity (LMA) and core body temperature (Tb). Following recovery, mice were administered modafinil (25, 50, 100 mg/kg), caffeine (2.5, 10, 20 mg/kg) or vehicle p.o. at ZT6 in balanced order. In WT mice, both modafinil and caffeine dose-dependently increased LMA for up to 6 h following dosing, whereas only the highest dose of each drug increased LMA in KO mice, and did so for less time after dosing. This effect was particularly pronounced following caffeine, such that total LMA response was significantly attenuated in KO mice compared to WT at all doses of caffeine and did not differ from Vehicle treatment. Tb increased comparably in both genotypes in a dose-dependent manner. TAAR1 deletion was associated with reduced wake consolidation following both drugs, but total time in wakefulness did not differ between KO and WT mice. Furthermore, gamma band EEG activity following both modafinil and caffeine treatment was attenuated in TAAR1 KO compared to WT mice. Our results show that TAAR1 is a critical component of the behavioral and cortical arousal associated with two widely-used psychostimulants with very different mechanisms of action. Together with our previous findings, these data suggest that TAAR1 is a previously-unrecognized component of an endogenous wake-modulating system.},

	abstract = {The serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptor is the primary molecular target of serotonergic hallucinogens, which trigger large-scale perturbations of the cortex. Our understanding of how 5-HT2A activation may cause the effects of hallucinogens has been hampered by the receptor unselectivity of most of the drugs of this class. Here we used 25CN-NBOH (N-(2-hydroxybenzyl)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyanophenylethylamine), a newly developed selective 5-HT2A agonist, and tested it with regard to the head-twitch-response (HTR) model of 5-HT2A activity and effects on locomotion. 25CN-NBOH evoked HTRs with an inverted u-shape-like dose-response curve and highest efficacy at 1.5 mg/kg, i.p. HTR occurrence peaked within five minutes after agonist injection, and exponentially decreased to half-maximal frequency at {\textasciitilde}11 minutes. Thorough habituation to the experimental procedures (including handling, saline injection, and exposure to the observational boxes one day before the experiment) facilitated the animals’ response to 25CN-NBOH. 25CN-NBOH (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced HTRs were blocked by the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (0.75 mg/kg, 30 min pre), but not by the 5-HT2C antagonist SB-242084 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min pre). SB-242084 instead slightly increased the number of HTRs occurring at a 3.0-mg/kg dose of the agonist. Apart from HTR induction, 25CN-NBOH also modestly increased locomotor activity of the mice. Repeated once-per-day injections (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) led to reduced occurrence of 25CN-NBOH induced HTRs. This intermediate tolerance was augmented when a second (higher) dose of the drug (3.0 mg/kg) was interspersed. Short-interval tolerance (i.e., tachyphylaxis) was observed when the drug was injected twice at intervals of 1.0 and 1.5 hours at either dose tested (1.5 mg/kg and 0.75 mg/kg, respectively). Inducing ketanserin-sensitive HTRs, which are dependent on environmental valences and which show signs of tachyphylaxis and tolerance, 25CN-NBOH shares striking features common to serotonergic hallucinogens. Given its distinct in vitro selectivity for 5-HT2A over non5-HT2 receptors and its behavioral kinetics, 25CN-NBOH appears to be a powerful tool for dissection of receptor-specific cortical circuit dynamics, including 5-HT2A related psychoactivity.},

Although the mechanisms underlying this sensitivity are thought to involve an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory activity throughout the brain, the underlying neural network properties associated with hypersensitivity to pain stimuli are largely unknown. In network science, explosive synchronization (ES) was introduced as a mechanism of hypersensitivity in diverse biological and physical systems that display explosive and global propagations with small perturbations. We hypothesized that ES may also be a mechanism of the hypersensitivity in FM brains. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) of 10 FM patients. First, we examined theoretically well-known ES conditions within functional brain networks reconstructed from EEG, then tested whether a brain network model with ES conditions identified in the EEG data is sensitive to an external perturbation. We demonstrate for the first time that the FM brain displays characteristics of ES conditions, and that these factors significantly correlate with chronic pain intensity. The simulation data support the conclusion that networks with ES conditions are more sensitive to perturbation compared to non-ES network. The model and empirical data analysis provide convergent evidence that ES may be a network mechanism of FM hypersensitivity.},

	abstract = {RationaleThe effect of LSD in humans has been described as occurring in two temporal phases. The behavioral effects in rats also occur in two temporal phases: an initial suppression of exploration followed by increased locomotor activity.ObjectivesWe decided to investigate this phenomenon from the perspective that the pharmacology might have relevance to the neurochemical mechanisms underlying psychosis.MethodsTwenty-five male Spragueâ€“Dawley rats were trained to discriminate LSD (186 nmol/kg, 0.08 mg/kg, i.p.) with a 30-min preinjection time (LSD-30, N=12) and LSD (372 nmol/kg, 0.16 mg/kg, i.p.) with a 90-min preinjection time (LSD-90, N=13) from saline, using a two-lever, food-reinforced operant conditioning task.ResultsLSD (186 or 372 nmol/kg, 0.08 or 0.16 mg/kg) given 30 min prior to training produced a cue that was completely antagonized by 5-HT2A antagonists and lasted no longer than 1 h. LSD (372 nmol/kg, 0.16 mg/kg) injected 90 min before training produced a cue that was not fully blocked by 5-HT2A antagonists, but instead was significantly inhibited by haloperidol. In these rats, substitution no longer occurred with the 5-HT2 agonists DOI or LSD (30 min preinjection), but full substitution was obtained with the D2 agonists apomorphine, N-propyldihydrexidine, and quinelorane.ConclusionThe discriminative stimulus effect of LSD in rats occurs in two phases, and these studies provide evidence that the later temporal phase is mediated by D2 dopamine receptor stimulation. A second temporal phase that involves dopaminergic pathways would be consistent with the widespread belief that excessive dopaminergic activity may be an underlying cause of paranoid psychosis.},

	abstract = {RationaleCannabinoids have been shown to alter time perception, but existing literature has several limitations. Few studies have included both time estimation and production tasks, few control for subvocal counting, most had small sample sizes, some did not record subjects’ cannabis use, many tested only one dose, and used either oral or inhaled administration of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), leading to variable pharmacokinetics, and some used whole-plant cannabis containing cannabinoids other than THC. Our study attempted to address these limitations.ObjectivesThis study aims to characterize the acute effects of THC and frequent cannabis use on seconds-range time perception. THC was hypothesized to produce transient, dose-related time overestimation and underproduction. Frequent cannabis smokers were hypothesized to show blunted responses to these alterations.MethodsIV THC was administered at doses from 0.015 to 0.05 mg/kg to 44 subjects who participated in several double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover, placebo-controlled studies. Visual time estimation and production tasks in the seconds range were presented to subjects three times on each test day.ResultsAll doses induced time overestimation and underproduction. Chronic cannabis use had no effect on baseline time perception. While infrequent/nonsmokers showed temporal overestimation at medium and high doses and temporal underproduction at all doses, frequent cannabis users showed no differences. THC effects on time perception were not dose related.ConclusionsA psychoactive dose of THC increases internal clock speed as indicated by time overestimation and underproduction. This effect is not dose related and is blunted in chronic cannabis smokers who did not otherwise have altered baseline time perception.},

Although some aspects of memory functions are known to be acutely impaired by Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC; the main active constituent of marijuana), effects on other aspects of memory are not known and the time course of functional impairments is unclear.Objective. The present study aimed to detail the acute and residual cognitive effects of Δ9-THC in infrequent cannabis users.Methods. A balanced, double-blind cross-over design was used to compare the effects of 7.5 mg and 15 mg Δ9-THC with matched placebo in 15 male volunteers. Participants were assessed pre and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24 and 48 h post-drug.Results. Δ9-THC 15 mg impaired performance on two explicit memory tasks at the time of peak plasma concentration (2 h post-drug). At the same time point, performance on an implicit memory task was preserved intact. The higher dose of Δ9-THC resulted in no learning whatsoever occurring over a three-trial selective reminding task at 2 h. Working memory was generally unaffected by Δ9-THC. In several tasks, Δ9-THC increased both speed and error rates, reflecting "riskier" speed-accuracy trade-offs. Subjective effects were also most marked at 2 h but often persisted longer, with participants rating themselves as "stoned" for 8 h. Participants experienced a strong drug effect, liked this effect and, until 4 h, wanted more oral Δ9-THC. No effects of Δ9-THC were found 24 or 48 h following ingestion indicating that the residual effects of oral Δ9-THC are minimal.Conclusions. These data demonstrate that oral Δ9-THC impairs episodic memory and learning in a dose-dependent manner whilst sparing perceptual priming and working memory.},

	abstract = {Introduction. Sexual desire is controlled by brain systems involved in sexual excitation and inhibition. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) may result from hypofunctional excitation, hyperfunctional inhibition, or some mix of the two. Aim. This study aimed to identify neurochemical and neuroanatomical systems involved in sexual excitation and inhibition, their role during normal, and hypoactive sexual expressions. Methods. A comprehensive review of the human and animal literature is made, and a theory surrounding the ways that HSDD can be manifested and treated is presented. Main Outcome Measures. Drug effects and neural systems derived largely from rat studies that are involved in the stimulation of sexual desire (excitatory system) vs. the stimulation of sexual reward, sedation, and satiety (inhibitory system). Results. Brain dopamine systems (incertohypothalamic and mesolimbic) that link the hypothalamus and limbic system appear to form the core of the excitatory system. This system also includes melanocortins, oxytocin, and norepinephrine. Brain opioid, endocannabinoid, and serotonin systems are activated during periods of sexual inhibition, and blunt the ability of excitatory systems to be activated. Conclusions. Drugs that stimulate the activation of hypothalamic dopamine or that blunt endocannabinoid or serotonin release and/or postsynaptic binding may be effective in stimulating sexual desire in animals and humans. The characterization of how those drugs work will help generate a rational approach to drug development in the treatment of HSDD. Pfaus JG. Pathways of sexual desire. J Sex Med 2009;6:1506â€“1533.},

When a large population of male rats is tested on sexual activity during a number of successive tests, over time individual rats display a very stable sexual behavior that is either slow, normal or fast as characterized by the number of ejaculations performed. These sexual endophenotypes are postulated as rat counterparts of premature (fast rats) or retarded ejaculation (slow rats). Psychopharmacology in these endophenotypes helps to delineate the underlying mechanisms and pathology. This is illustrated by the effects of serotonergic antidepressants and serotonergic compounds on sexual and ejaculatory behavior of rats. These preclinical studies and models contribute to a better understanding of the neurobiology of ejaculation and boost the development of novel drug targets to treat ejaculatory disorders such as premature and retarded ejaculation.},

However, none of these proposed models adequately represents human ejaculatory disorders. Based on the “ejaculation distribution theory”, which postulates that the intravaginal ejaculation latency time in men is represented by a biological continuum, we have developed an animal model for the research of premature and delayed ejaculation. In this model, a large number of male Wistar rats are investigated during 4–6 weekly sexual behavioural tests. Based on the number of ejaculations during 30 min tests, rapid and sluggish ejaculating rats are distinguished, each representing approximately 10\% at both ends of a Gaussian distribution. Together with other parameters, such as ejaculation latency time, these rats at either side of the spectrum resemble men with premature and delayed ejaculation, respectively. Comparable to the human situation, in a normal population of rats, endophenotypes exist with regard to basal sexual (ejaculatory) performance.},

The endocannabinoid system is involved in the central effects of many psychoactive compounds and of stress. Whether caffeine alters the cannabinoid system and interferes with stress-induced synaptic alterations is however unknown. We have studied electrophysiologically the sensitivity of cannabinoid receptors modulating synaptic transmission in the striatum of mice exposed to caffeine in their drinking solution. Chronic caffeine assumption sensitized GABAergic synapses to the presynaptic effect of cannabinoid CB1 receptor stimulation by exo- and endocannabinoids. Caffeine was conversely unable to affect the sensitivity of cannabinoid receptors modulating glutamate transmission. The synaptic effects of caffeine were slowly reversible after its removal from the drinking solution. Furthermore, although exposure to caffeine for only 24h did not produce measurable changes of the sensitivity of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, it was able to contrast the down-regulation of CB1 receptor-mediated responses after social defeat stress. Our data suggest that the cannabinoid system is implicated in the psychoactive properties of caffeine and in the ability of caffeine to reduce the pathological consequences of stress.},

Mild liquid phase reactions were tested at 50–66 °C using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidizing agent. XRD, TGA, ESR, DR-UV, and FTIR revealed the dislodged iron oxide species formed by treating at ≥500 °C. Formation of active oxidizing species on the surface occurs on contact the dislodged Fe(III) oxide with H2O2. Such active species can promote the oxidation of THF, giving high yield and selectivity of BTL, whereas the iron-containing clay treated at lower temperatures ({\textless}500 °C) perform Fenton-like oxidation with lower THF conversions and non-selective products. 2-Hydroxytetrahydrofuran (THF-2-ol) was primarily produced and further oxidized to BTL with a small amount of 4-hydroxybutyric acid as a minor product. Minimal H2O2/THF ratio of 1.0 is sufficient for the production of BTL. Deactivation can be observed presumably due to deposition of the products despite slight leaching of the active iron species.},

	abstract = {The vast majority of states have enacted full or partial medical marijuana (MMJ) programs, causing the number of patients seeking certification for MMJ use to increase dramatically in recent years. Despite increased use of MMJ across the nation, no studies thus far have examined the specific impact of MMJ on cognitive function and related brain activation. In the present study, MMJ patients seeking treatment for a variety of documented medical conditions were assessed prior to initiating MMJ treatment and after three months of treatment as part of a larger longitudinal study. In order to examine the effect of MMJ treatment on task-related brain activation, MMJ patients completed the Multi-Source Interference Test (MSIT) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We also collected data regarding conventional medication use, clinical state, and health-related measures at each visit. Following three months of treatment, MMJ patients demonstrated improved task performance accompanied by changes in brain activation patterns within the cingulate cortex and frontal regions. Interestingly, after MMJ treatment, brain activation patterns appeared more similar to those exhibited by healthy controls from previous studies than at pre-treatment, suggestive of a potential normalization of brain function relative to baseline. These findings suggest that MMJ use may result in different effects relative to recreational MJ use, as recreational consumers have been shown to exhibit decrements in task performance accompanied by altered brain activation. Moreover, patients in the current study also reported improvements in clinical state and health-related measures as well as notable decreases in prescription medication use, particularly opiates and benzodiapezines after three months of treatment. Further research is needed to clarify the specific neurobiologic impact, clinical efficacy and unique effects of MMJ for a range of indications and how it compares to recreational MJ use.},

	abstract = {The aim of the current study was to determine the degree to which patients with panic disorder develop tolerance to subjective and physiological effects of benzodiazepine after chronic treatment with alprazolam. Response to acute administration of diazepam was assessed in 19 panic disorder patients receiving chronic treatment with alprazolam and 23 untreated panic disorder patients. At baseline in the laboratory, the two groups did not differ in peak saccadic eye movement velocity, saccade latency, short-term memory, plasma cortisol and growth hormone concentrations, heart rate, and self-rated levels of sedation and anxiety. Compared with untreated patients, alprazolam-treated patients displayed significantly less diazepam-induced change in peak saccadic velocity, saccade latency, growth hormone secretion, memory, and self-rated levels of sedation. There was no difference between groups in diazepam effects on plasma cortisol concentrations or self-rated anxiety. Within alprazolam-treated patients, diazepam-induced slowing of peak saccade velocity was significantly inversely correlated with illness severity, as measured by reported panic attacks per week and severity of phobic avoidance, but not with alprazolam dose, blood level, or duration of treatment. Because the alprazolam-treated group reported more panic attacks per week than the untreated panic patients, treated patients were divided into those who were asymptomatic versus those with continuing panic attacks. The subgroup of nine alprazolam-treated subjects who were asymptomatic also showed significantly less diazepam effects than the group of untreated panic disorder patients, suggesting that overall group differences were at least partially attributable to the development of tolerance to selected benzodiazepine effects with chronic alprazolam treatment.},

	abstract = {The heterogeneity of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors contributes to the diversity of neuronal inhibition in the regulation of information processing. Although most GABAA receptors are located synaptically, the small population of α5GABAA receptors is largely expressed extrasynaptically. To clarify the role of the α5GABAA receptors in the control of behavior, a histidine-to-arginine point mutation was introduced in position 105 of the murine α5 subunit gene, which rendered the α5GABAA receptors diazepam-insensitive. Apart from an incomplete muscle relaxing effect, neither the sedative, anticonvulsant, nor anxiolytic-like activity of diazepam was impaired in α5(H105R) mice. However, in hippocampal pyramidal cells, the point mutation resulted in a selective reduction of α5GABAA receptors, which altered the drug-independent behavior. In line with the role of the hippocampus in certain forms of associative learning, trace fear conditioning, but not delay conditioning or contextual conditioning, was facilitated in the mutant mice. Trace fear conditioning differs from delay conditioning in that the conditioned and unconditioned stimulus are separated by a time interval. Thus, the largely extrasynaptic α5GABAA receptors in hippocampal pyramidal cells are implicated as control elements of the temporal association of threat cues in trace fear conditioning.},

Psilocybin was administered double-blind and instructions to participants/staff minimized expectancy confounds. Psilocybin was administered 1 and 2 months after spiritual-practice initiation. Outcomes at 6 months included rates of spiritual practice and persisting effects of psilocybin. Compared with low-dose, high-dose psilocybin produced greater acute and persisting effects. At 6 months, compared with LD-SS, both high-dose groups showed large significant positive changes on longitudinal measures of interpersonal closeness, gratitude, life meaning/purpose, forgiveness, death transcendence, daily spiritual experiences, religious faith and coping, and community observer ratings. Determinants of enduring effects were psilocybin-occasioned mystical-type experience and rates of meditation/spiritual practices.

Preliminary studies in animals and humans suggest that ayahuasca, psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may have antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive properties. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of clinical trials published from 1990 until 2015, assessing these therapeutic properties. Electronic searches were performed using the PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO databases. Only clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals were included. Of these, 151 studies were identified, of which six met the established criteria. Reviewed studies suggest beneficial effects for treatment-resistant depression, anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening diseases, and tobacco and alcohol dependence. All drugs were well tolerated. In conclusion, ayahuasca, psilocybin and LSD may be useful pharmacological tools for the treatment of drug dependence, and anxiety and mood disorders, especially in treatment-resistant patients. These drugs may also be useful pharmacological tools to understand psychiatric disorders and to develop new therapeutic agents. However, all studies reviewed had small sample sizes, and half of them were open-label, proof-of-concept studies. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with more patients are needed to replicate these preliminary findings.},

	abstract = {Cognitive enhancement is perhaps one of the most intriguing and controversial topics in neuroscience today. Currently, the main classes of drugs used as potential cognitive enhancers include psychostimulants (methylphenidate (MPH), amphetamine), but wakefulness-promoting agents (modafinil) and glutamate activators (ampakine) are also frequently used. Pharmacologically, substances that enhance the components of the memory/learning circuits—dopamine, glutamate (neuronal excitation), and/or norepinephrine—stand to improve brain function in healthy individuals beyond their baseline functioning. In particular, non-medical use of prescription stimulants such as MPH and illicit use of psychostimulants for cognitive enhancement have seen a recent rise among teens and young adults in schools and college campuses. However, this enhancement likely comes with a neuronal, as well as ethical, cost. Altering glutamate function via the use of psychostimulants may impair behavioral flexibility, leading to the development and/or potentiation of addictive behaviors. Furthermore, dopamine and norepinephrine do not display linear effects; instead, their modulation of cognitive and neuronal function maps on an inverted-U curve. Healthy individuals run the risk of pushing themselves beyond optimal levels into hyperdopaminergic and hypernoradrenergic states, thus vitiating the very behaviors they are striving to improve. Finally, recent studies have begun to highlight potential damaging effects of stimulant exposure in healthy juveniles. This review explains how the main classes of cognitive enhancing drugs affect the learning and memory circuits, and highlights the potential risks and concerns in healthy individuals, particularly juveniles and adolescents. We emphasize the performance enhancement at the potential cost of brain plasticity that is associated with the neural ramifications of nootropic drugs in the healthy developing brain.},

The purpose of this study was to examine effects of clinically prescribed doses of d-amphetamine and one abuse dose administered from childhood to adulthood on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and activation of the granule layer of the dentate gyrus. Beginning in early adolescence (age 28 days) to adulthood (age 71), male C57BL/6J mice were administered twice daily i.p. injections of vehicle, 0.25, 0.5 or 2 mg/kg d-amphetamine. Locomotor activity was measured in home cages by video tracking. At age 53–56, mice received BrdU injections to label dividing cells. Immunohistochemical detection of BrdU, NeuN, Doublecortin (Dcx) and Ki67 was used to measure neurogenesis and cell proliferation at age 71. ΔFosB was measured as an indicator of repeated neuronal activation. An additional cohort of mice was treated similarly except euthanized at age 58 to measure activation of granule neurons from d-amphetamine (by detection of c-Fos) and cell proliferation (ki67) at a time when the fate of BrdU cells would have been determined in the first cohort. D-amphetamine dose-dependently increased survival and differentiation of BrdU cells into neurons and increased number of Dcx cells without affecting number of Ki67 cells. Low doses of d-amphetamine decreased c-Fos and ΔFosB in the granule layer. Only the high dose induced substantial locomotor stimulation and sensitization. Results suggest both therapeutic and abuse doses of d-amphetamine increase number of new neurons in the hippocampus when administered from adolescence to adulthood by increasing survival and differentiation of cells into neurons not by increasing progenitor cell proliferation. Mechanisms for amphetamine-induced neurogenesis are unknown but appear activity-independent. Results suggest part of the beneficial effects of therapeutic doses of d-amphetamine for ADHD could be via increased hippocampal neurogenesis.},

	abstract = {Sarcosine, an endogenous amino acid, is a competitive inhibitor of the type I glycine transporter and an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) coagonist. Recently, we found that sarcosine, an NMDAR enhancer, can improve depression-related behaviors in rodents and humans. This result differs from previous studies, which have reported antidepressant effects of NMDAR antagonists. The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic response of sarcosine remain unknown. This study examines the role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate receptor (AMPAR) activation, which are involved in the antidepressant-like effects of several glutamatergic system modulators. The effects of sarcosine in a forced swim test (FST) and the expression levels of phosphorylated mTOR signaling proteins were examined in the absence or presence of mTOR and AMPAR inhibitors. In addition, the influence of sarcosine on AMPAR trafficking was determined by analyzing the phosphorylation of AMPAR subunit GluR1 at the PKA site (often considered an indicator for GluR1 membrane insertion in neurons). A single injection of sarcosine exhibited antidepressant-like effects in rats in the FST and rapidly activated the mTOR signaling pathway, which were significantly blocked by mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or the AMPAR inhibitor 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline (NBQX) pretreatment. Moreover, NBQX pretreatment eliminated the ability of sarcosine to stimulate the phosphorylated mTOR signaling proteins. Furthermore, GluR1 phosphorylation at its PKA site was significantly increased after an acute in vivo sarcosine treatment. The results demonstrated that sarcosine exerts antidepressant-like effects by enhancing AMPAR–mTOR signaling pathway activity and facilitating AMPAR membrane insertion. Highlights: - A single injection of sarcosine rapidly exerted antidepressant-like effects with a concomitant increase in the activation of the mTOR signaling},

	abstract = {Newer antidepressants are needed for the many individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) that do not respond adequately to treatment and because of a delay of weeks before the emergence of therapeutic effects. Recent evidence from clinical trials shows that the NMDA antagonist ketamine is a revolutionary novel antidepressant because it acts rapidly and is effective for treatment-resistant patients. A single infusion of ketamine alleviates depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant depressed patients within hours and these effects may be sustained for up to 2 weeks. Although the discovery of ketamine's effects has reshaped drug discovery for antidepressants, the psychotomimetic properties of this compound limit the use of this therapy to the most severely ill patients. In order to develop additional antidepressants like ketamine, adequate preclinical behavioral screening paradigms for fast-acting antidepressants need to be established and used to identify the underlying neural mechanisms. This review examines the preclinical literature attempting to model the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine. Acute administration of ketamine has produced effects in behavioral screens for antidepressants like the forced swim test, novelty suppression of feeding and in rodent models for depression. Protracted behavioral effects of ketamine have been reported to appear after a single treatment that last for days. This temporal pattern is similar to its clinical effects and may serve as a new animal paradigm for rapid antidepressant effects in humans. In addition, protracted changes in molecules mediating synaptic plasticity have been implicated in mediating the antidepressant-like behavioral effects of ketamine. Current preclinical studies are examining compounds with more specific pharmacological effects at glutamate receptors and synapses in order to develop additional rapidly acting antidepressants without the hallucinogenic side effects or abuse potential of ketamine.},

	abstract = {It is known that tianeptine exhibits antidepressant-like activity. Its influence on the glutamatergic system is also known, but the mechanisms involved in this activity remain to be established. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of the glutamate pathway in the antidepressant-like action of tianeptine. We investigated the effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptor ligands on tianeptine-induced activity in the forced swim test (FST) in mice. The antidepressant-like activity of tianeptine (30 m/kg, ip) was significantly antagonized by D-serine (100 nmol/mouse icv) and NBQX (10 mg/kg, ip). Moreover, low, ineffective doses of the glycine/NMDA site antagonist L-701,324 (1 mg/kg, ip) administered together with low, ineffective doses of tianeptine (20 mg/kg, ip) exhibited a significant reduction of immobility time in the FST. These doses of the examined agents, which did have an effect in the FST, did not alter locomotor activity. The present study indicates that the antidepressant-like activity of tianeptine in the FST involves both NMDA and AMPA receptors and suggests that the interaction between serotonergic and glutamatergic transmission may play an important role in the action of tianeptine.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiologic studies suggesting that there were differences in cancer recurrence contingent on anesthetic regimens have raised the possibility that μ-opioid agonists can influence cancer progression. Based on our previous studies indicating the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) is up-regulated in several types of non-small cell lung cancer, this study examined the functional significance of MOR overexpression to elucidate a possible mechanism for the epidemiologic findings.
METHODS: Stable vector control and MOR1 overexpressing human bronchioloalveolar carcinoma cells were evaluated using immunoblot analysis, proliferation and transendothelial extravasation assays with or without Akt inhibitor, mTOR inhibitor (temsirolimus), or the peripheral MOR antagonist, methylnaltrexone. In human lung cancer xenograft models, primary tumor growth rates and lung metastasis were analyzed using consecutive tumor volume measurements and nestin immunoreactivity in lungs of the nude mouse model.
RESULTS: The authors provide evidence that MOR is an important regulator of lung cancer progression. MOR overexpression increased Akt and mTOR activation, proliferation, and extravasation in human bronchioloalveolar carcinoma cells. In vivo, overexpression of MOR in human bronchoalveolar carcinoma cells increased primary tumor growth rates in nude mice by approximately 2.5-fold and lung metastasis by approximately 20-fold compared with vector control cells (n = 4 per condition).
CONCLUSIONS: The overexpression data suggest a possible direct effect of MOR on Akt and mTOR activation and lung cancer progression. Such an effect provides a plausible explanation for the epidemiologic findings. The authors' observations further suggest that exploration of MOR in non-small cell lung carcinoma merits further study both as a diagnostic and therapeutic option.},

Our previous studies revealed that agmatine attenuates opioid addiction and prevents the adaptation of glutamate neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens of chronic morphine-treated rats. The hippocampus is important for drug addiction; however, whether adaptation of glutamate neurotransmission is modulated by agmatine in the hippocampus remains unknown. Here, we found that continuous pretreatment of rats with ascending doses of morphine for 5 days resulted in an increase in the hippocampal extracellular glutamate level induced by naloxone (2 mg/kg, i.p.) precipitation. Agmatine (20 mg/kg, s.c.) administered concurrently with morphine for 5 days attenuated the elevation of extracellular glutamate levels induced by naloxone precipitation. Furthermore, in the hippocampal synaptosome model, agmatine decreased the release and increased the uptake of glutamate in synaptosomes from chronic morphine-treated rats, which might contribute to the reduced elevation of glutamate levels induced by agmatine. We also found that expression of the hippocampal NR2B subunit, rather than the NR1 subunit, of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) was down-regulated after chronic morphine treatment, and agmatine inhibited this reduction. Taken together, agmatine prevented the adaptation of the hippocampal glutamate system caused by chronic exposure to morphine, including modulating extracellular glutamate concentration and NMDAR expression, which might be one of the mechanisms underlying the attenuation of opioid addiction by agmatine.},

Single oral doses (100, 200 and 300 mg) of moclobemide, a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) with predominant effects on the A-type of the enzyme, were administered to eight young, healthy male volunteers in a double-blind, random-order, placebo-controlled study. The investigation was thereafter continued in an open fashion by administering a single 10 mg dose of the MAO-B inhibitor deprenyl to the same subjects. 2. Deamination of catecholamines was powerfully and dose-dependently inhibited by moclobemide, as evidenced by up to 40\% decreases in the urinary excretion of deaminated catecholamine metabolites, corresponding increases in the excretion of non-deaminated, methylated metabolites, and up to 79\% average decreases in the plasma concentration of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), a deaminated metabolite of noradrenaline (NA), and up to 75\% average decreases in the plasma concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), a deaminated metabolite of dopamine. The urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) was only slightly reduced. In contrast, deprenyl, in a dose which almost totally inhibited MAO-B activity in blood platelets, did not appreciably affect the plasma concentrations of DHPG or DOPAC. 3. Due to the rapid, reversible, dose-dependent and MAO-A specific effect of moclobemide on plasma concentrations of DHPG, it is suggested that DHPG in plasma may be a useful indicator of the magnitude and duration of MAO-A inhibition in man. 4. Sympatho-adrenal function at rest was not significantly altered by moclobemide, as judged by unchanged plasma catecholamine concentrations and stable blood pressure and heart rate recordings. 5. Monoamine oxidase type B activity in blood platelets was slightly (less than 30\%) and transiently inhibited after moclobemide. 6. The secretion of prolactin was dose-dependently stimulated by moclobemide, whereas the plasma concentrations of growth hormone (hGH) and cortisol remained unchanged.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent neuropsychiatric disease that causes profound social and economic burdens. The impact of MDD is compounded by the limited therapeutic efficacy and delay of weeks to months of currently available medications. These issues highlight the need for more efficacious and faster-acting treatments to alleviate the burdens of MDD. Recent breakthroughs demonstrate that certain drugs, including ketamine and scopolamine, produce rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effects in MDD patients. Moreover, preclinical work has shown that the antidepressant actions of ketamine and scopolamine in rodent models are caused by an increase of extracellular glutamate, elevated BDNF, activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) cascade, and increased number and function of spine synapses in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here we review studies showing that both ketamine and scopolamine elicit rapid antidepressant effects through converging molecular and cellular mechanisms in the PFC. In addition, we discuss evidence that selective antagonists of NMDA and muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptor subtypes (i.e., NR2B and M1-AChR) in the PFC produce comparable antidepressant responses. Furthermore, we discuss evidence that ketamine and scopolamine antagonize inhibitory interneurons in the PFC leading to disinhibition of pyramidal neurons and increased extracellular glutamate that promotes the rapid antidepressant responses to these agents. Collectively, these studies indicate that specific NMDA and mACh receptor subtypes on GABAergic interneurons are promising targets for novel rapid-acting antidepressant therapies.},

	abstract = {Personal social network size exhibits considerable variation in the human population and is associated with both physical and mental health status. Much of this inter-individual variation in human sociality remains unexplained from a biological perspective. According to the brain opioid theory of social attachment, binding of the neuropeptide β-endorphin to μ-opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) is a key neurochemical mechanism involved in social bonding, particularly amongst primates. We hypothesise that a positive association exists between activity of the μ-opioid system and the number of social relationships that an individual maintains. Given the powerful analgesic properties of β-endorphin, we tested this hypothesis using pain tolerance as an assay for activation of the endogenous μ-opioid system. We show that a simple measure of pain tolerance correlates with social network size in humans. Our results are in line with previous studies suggesting that μ-opioid receptor signalling has been elaborated beyond its basic function of pain modulation to play an important role in managing our social encounters. The neuroplasticity of the μ-opioid system is of future research interest, especially with respect to psychiatric disorders associated with symptoms of social withdrawal and anhedonia, both of which are strongly modulated by endogenous opioids.},

Following completion of a small open-label feasibility study, we are currently conducting a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of psilocybin-assisted treatment of alcohol use disorder. Although treatment effects cannot be analyzed until the study is complete, descriptive case studies provide a useful window into the therapeutic process of psychedelic-assisted treatment of addiction. Here we describe treatment trajectories of three participants in the ongoing trial to illustrate the range of experiences and persisting effects of psilocybin treatment. Although it is difficult to generalize from a few cases, several qualitative conclusions can be drawn from the data presented here. Although participants often find it difficult to describe much of their psilocybin experience, pivotal moments tend to be individualized, extremely vivid, and memorable. Often, the qualitative content extends beyond the clinical problem that is being addressed. The participants discussed in this paper experienced acute and lasting alterations in their perceptions of self, in the quality of their baseline consciousness, and in their relationship to alcohol and drinking. In these cases, experiences of catharsis, forgiveness, self-compassion, and love were at least as salient as classic mystical content. Finally, feelings of increased "spaciousness" or mindfulness, and increased control over choices and behavior were reported following the drug administration sessions. Ultimately, psilocybin-assisted treatment appears to elicit experiences that are extremely variable, yet seem to meet the particular needs of the individual.},

In the last years were published many epidemiological articles aiming to link driving under the influence of cannabis with the risk of various unfavorable traffic events, with sometimes contradictory results. Aim. The primary objective of this study was to analyse whether there is a significant association between druving under the influence of cannabis and unfavorable traffic events. Materials and methods. We used two meta-analytical methods to assess the statistical significance of the effect size: random effects model and inverse variance heterogeneity model. Results. 24 studies were included in the meta-analysis. we obtained significant increases in the effect size for driving under the influence of cannabis tested through blood analysis, with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.27 and a Confidence Interval (CI) between 1.36-3.80, death as an outcome, with an OR of 1.56, and a CI between 1.16 and 2.09, and case-control as the type of study, with an OR of 1.99 and a CI between 1.05 and 3.80. Publication bias was very high. Conclusion. Our analysis suggests that the overall effect size for driving under the influence of cannabis on unfavorable traffic events is not statistically significant, but there are significant differences obtained through subgroup analysis. This result might be caused by either methodological flaws (which are often encountered in articles on this topic), the indiscriminate employment of the term “cannabis use” or an actual absence of an adverse effect. When a driver is found, in traffic, with a positive reaction suggesting cannabis use, the result should be corroborated by either objective data regarding marijuana usage (like blood analyses, with clear cut-off values), or a clinical assessment of the impairment, before establishing his/her fitness to drive.},

	abstract = {The nucleus accumbens shell is a site of converging inputs during memory processing for emotional events. The accumbens receives input from the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) regarding changes in peripheral autonomic functioning following emotional arousal. The shell also receives input from the amygdala and hippocampus regarding affective and contextual attributes of new learning experiences. The successful encoding of affect or context is facilitated by activating noradrenergic systems in either the amygdala or hippocampus. Recent findings indicate that memory enhancement produced by activating NTS neurons, is attenuated by suppressing accumbens functioning after learning. This finding illustrates the significance of the shell in integrating information from the periphery to modulate memory for arousing events. However, it is not known if the accumbens shell plays an equally important role in consolidating information that is initially processed in the amygdala and hippocampus. The present study determined if the convergence of inputs from these limbic regions within the nucleus accumbens contributes to successful encoding of emotional events into memory. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received bilateral cannula implants 2mm above the accumbens shell and a second bilateral implant 2mm above either the amygdala or hippocampus. The subjects were trained for 6 days to drink from a water spout. On day 7, a 0.35mA footshock was initiated as the rat approached the spout and was terminated once the rat escaped into a neutral compartment. Subjects were then given intra-amygdala or hippocampal infusions of PBS or a dose of norepinephrine (0.2Î¼g) previously shown to enhance memory. Later, all subjects were given intra-accumbens infusion of muscimol to functionally inactivate the shell. Muscimol inactivation of the accumbens shell was delayed to allow sufficient time for norepinephrine to activate intracellular cascades that lead to long-term synaptic modifications involved in forming new memories. Results show that memory improvement produced by infusing norepinephrine in either the amygdala or hippocampus is attenuated by interrupting neuronal activity in the shell 1 or 7 seven hours following amygdala or hippocampus activation. These findings suggest that the accumbens shell plays an integral role modulating information initially processed by the amygdala and hippocampus following exposure to emotionally},

	abstract = {Purpose/Background In animal models, levels of the neurosteroid pregnenolone increase after tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) administration and pregnenolone appears to attenuate the brain effects of THC. Given these interactions between pregnenolone and THC, we evaluated baseline neurosteroid levels in participants with a history of a cannabis use disorders (CUDs).
        Methods/Procedures Bipolar depressed participants were enrolled in a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of add-on pregnenolone for depression and before receiving pregnenolone or placebo. Baseline serum levels of neurosteroids (pregnenolone, allopregnanolone, pregnanolone, and androsterone) were analyzed in 53 participants with highly sensitive and specific gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Current, active substance use disorders, or a positive baseline urine drug screen, were exclusionary. Participants were classified by past cannabis abuse or dependence diagnosis using the structured clinical interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Data were analyzed by independent t tests for separate neurosteroids.
        Findings/Results Participants with a history of CUD had higher serum pregnanolone, lower allopregnanolone, a higher pregnanolone to allopregnanolone ratio, and a lower pregnenolone to pregnanolone ratio compared with those without a history of cannabis use. Similar findings were not observed based on a history of other substance use disorders with the exception of lower allopregnanolone in those with opioid use disorders. Notably, the majority of those with an opioid use disorder also had a CUD (75\%).
        Implications/Conclusions These findings potentially suggest either enduring changes in neurosteroids in people with past CUDs or represent a vulnerability marker for a CUD.},

	abstract = {BackgroundIt has been reported that D1 receptor (D1R) activation reduces GABAA receptor (GABAAR) current, and baicalin (BAI) displays therapeutic efficacy in diseases involving cognitive impairment.MethodsWe investigated the mechanisms by which BAI could improve DA-induced minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) using immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and co-immunoprecipitation.ResultsBAI did not induce toxicity on the primary cultured neurons. And no obvious toxicity of BAI to the brain was found in rats. DA activated D1R/dopamine and adenosine 3′5′-monophosphate-regulated phospho-protein (DARPP32) to reduce the GABAAR current; BAI treatment did not change the D1R/DARPP32 levels but blocked DA-induced reduction of GABAAR levels in primary cultured neurons. DA decreased the interaction of GABAAR with TrkB and the expression of downstream AKT, which was blocked by BAI treatment. Moreover, BAI reversed the decrease in the expression of GABAAR/TrkB/AKT and prevented the impairment of synaptogenesis and memory deficits in MHE rats.ConclusionsThese results suggest that BAI has neuroprotective and synaptoprotective effects on MHE which are not related to upstream D1R/DARPP32 signaling, but to the targeting of downstream GABAAR signaling to TrkB.},

Resistance exercise rats were trained to climb a vertical ladder wearing a weighted vest; sedentary control rats were placed repeatedly on the ladder oriented horizontally on its side. All rats were implanted with intravenous catheters and trained to self-administer heroin on a fixed ratio (FR1) schedule of reinforcement. mRNA expression in the NAc core and shell was examined following behavioral testing.ResultsResistance exercise significantly decreased heroin self-administration, resulting in a downward shift in the dose-effect curve. Resistance exercise also reduced mRNA expression for mu opioid receptors and dopamine D1, D2, and D3 receptors in the NAc core. Resistance exercise increased mRNA expression of dopamine D5 receptors in the NAc shell and increased mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (exons I, IIB, IIC, IV, VI, IX) in the NAc core.ConclusionsThese data indicate that resistance exercise decreases the positive reinforcing effects of heroin and produces changes in opioid and dopamine systems in the NAc of heroin-exposed rats.},

	abstract = {RationaleAssociated with frank neuropathology, patients with Alzheimer’s disease suffer from a host of neuropsychiatric symptoms that include depression, apathy, agitation, and aggression. Negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of α5-containing GABAA receptors have been suggested to be a novel target for antidepressant action. We hypothesized that pharmacological modulation of this target would engender increased motivation in stressful environments.MethodsWe utilized electrophysiological recordings from Xenopus oocytes and behavioral measures in mice to address this hypothesis.ResultsIn the forced-swim assay in mice that detects antidepressant drugs, the α5β3γ2 GABAΑ receptor NAM, RY-080 produced a marked antidepressant phenotype. Another compound, PWZ-029, was characterized as an α5β3γ2 receptor NAM of lower intrinsic efficacy in electrophysiological studies in Xenopus oocytes. In contrast to RY-080, PWZ-029 was only moderately active in the forced-swim assay and the α5β3γ2 receptor antagonist, Xli-093, was not active at all. The effects of RY-080 were prevented by the non-selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil as well as by the selective ligands, PWZ-029 and Xli-093. These findings demonstrate that this effect of RY-080 is driven by negative allosteric modulation of α5βγ2 GABAA receptors. RY-080 was not active in the tail-suspension test. We also demonstrated a reduction in the age-dependent hyperactivity exhibited by transgenic mice that accumulate pathological tau (rTg4510 mice) by RY-080. The decrease in hyperactivity by RY-080 was selective for the hyperactivity of the rTg4510 mice since the locomotion of control strains of mice were not significantly affected by RY-080.Conclusionsα5βγ2 GABAA receptor NAMs might function as a pharmacological treatment for mood, amotivational syndromes, and psychomotor agitation in patients with Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative disorders.},

Indirect calorimetry measured respiratory exchange ratio (RER), energy expenditure, motor activity, and food and water consumption for 22.5 h between select self-administration sessions.ResultsSelf-administered nicotine suppressed weight gain and reduced the percent of body fat without altering the percent of lean mass, as measured by Echo MRI. Nicotine reduced RER, indicating increased fat utilization; this effect was observed prior to weight suppression. Moreover, nicotine intake did not affect motor activity or energy expenditure. Daily food intake was not altered by nicotine self-administration; however, a trend in suppression of meal size, a transient suppression of water intake, and an increase in meal frequency was observed.ConclusionThese data provide evidence that self-administered nicotine suppresses body weight via increased fat metabolism, independent of significant changes in feeding, activity, or energy expenditure.},

Similar findings were observed in a glutamatergic model of psychosis, but the role of serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors in information processing is less clear.ObjectivesWe studied ERPs in a serotonergic model of psychosis, induced by psilocybin, a psychedelic with 5-HT2A/C agonistic properties, in healthy volunteers.MethodsTwenty subjects (10M/10F) were given 0.26 mg/kg of psilocybin orally in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design. ERPs (P300, MMN) were registered during the peak of intoxication. Correlations between measured electrophysiological variables and psilocin serum levels and neuropsychological effects were also analyzed.ResultsPsilocybin induced robust psychedelic effects and psychotic-like symptoms, decreased P300 amplitude (p = 0.009) but did not affect the MMN. Psilocybin’s disruptive effect on P300 correlated with the intensity of the psychedelic state, which was dependent on the psilocin serum levels. We also observed a decrease in N100 amplitude (p = 0.039) in the P300 paradigm and a negative correlation between P300 and MMN amplitude (p = 0.014).ConclusionsEven though pre-attentive cognition (MMN) was not affected, processing at the early perceptual level (N100) and in higher-order cognition (P300) was significantly disrupted by psilocybin.

Cigarettes with nicotine yields as low as 0.05 mg produce substantial occupancy of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (26\%), but women and men respond differently to these cigarettes.ObjectiveThis study aimed to measure responses to smoking cigarettes that varied widely in nicotine yields, investigating whether sex differences in the effects on craving, withdrawal, and affect would be observed at even lower nicotine yields than previously studied, and in young smokers.MethodsOvernight abstinent young smokers (23 men, 23 women, mean age 22.18) provided self-reports of craving, withdrawal, and affect before and after smoking cigarettes with yields of 0.027, 0.110, 0.231, or 0.763 mg nicotine, and evaluated characteristics of each cigarette.ResultsCompared to abstinent young men, abstinent young women reported greater negative affect, psychological withdrawal, and sedation, all of which were relieved equally by all cigarettes. Men but not women reported greater craving reduction, perceived nicotine content, and cigarette liking with increasing nicotine dose.ConclusionsMen may experience less smoking-related relief of craving, and enjoy cigarettes less, if nicotine yields are reduced to very low levels. Conversely, women respond equally well to cigarettes with nicotine yields as low as 0.027 mg as to cigarettes with nicotine yields 28-fold higher (0.763 mg). These differences are relevant for policy regarding reduced nicotine in cigarettes and may influence the efficacy and acceptability of reduced-nicotine cigarettes as smoking cessation aids.},

No mechanistic studies on the effects of 5-HT2C agonists on food intake in humans have been conducted to date.ObjectivesThe present study examined the effects of the 5-HT2C receptor agonist meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) on food consumption, eating microstructure and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to food pictures in healthy female volunteers.MethodsIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, participants were randomized immediately after screening to receive oral mCPP (30mg) in a single morning dose, or placebo, in a counterbalanced order. Test foods were served from a Universal Eating Monitor (UEM) that measured eating rate and fMRI BOLD signals to the sight of food and non-food images were recorded.ResultsmCPP decreased rated appetite and intake of a palatable snack eaten in the absence of hunger but had no significant effect on the consumption of a pasta lunch (although pasta eating rate was reduced). mCPP also decreased BOLD fMRI responses to the sight of food pictures in areas of reward-associated circuitry. A post hoc analysis identified individual variability in the response to mCPP (exploratory responder-non-responder analysis). Some participants did not reduce their cookie intake after treatment with mCPP and this lack of response was associated with enhanced ratings of cookie pleasantness and enhanced baseline BOLD responses to food images in key reward and appetite circuitry.ConclusionsThese results suggest that 5-HT2C receptor activation in humans inhibits food reward-related responding and that further investigation of stratification of responding to mCPP and other 5-HT2C receptor agonists is warranted.},

After hypothyroidism was confirmed by thyroid function tests, serotonin positron emission tomography (PET) was performed for 120 min. All PET data were spatially normalized to T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging templates; then, time-activity curves of the hippocampus, septum, and cerebellum were extracted using predefined volume-of-interest templates. Non-displaceable binding values in the hippocampus and septum were calculated using a multilinear reference tissue model and parametric maps were constructed. Both volume-of-interest and voxel-based analyses showed higher brain uptake in the thyroidectomized and hypophysectomized rats compared to the respective sham-operated rats.ResultsTime-activity curves showed that the brain uptake values for the thyroidectomized and hypophysectomized groups were 21–52\% higher than were those in the respective control groups. In the thyroidectomized group, the binding potential values for the hippocampus and septum were 20–26\% higher than were those in the sham-thyroidectomized group. In the hypophysectomized group, the binding value for the hippocampus was 23\% higher than was that in the sham-hypophysectomized group, whereas the septal binding was not significantly different from that in the sham-hypophysectomized group. Parametric maps for the hypothyroidism also showed significantly higher binding values than did those for the controls.ConclusionOur results demonstrate that hypothyroidism elevates serotonin 1A receptor binding in the limbic system.},

	abstract = {All modern clinical studies using the classic hallucinogen lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in healthy subjects or patients in the last 25 years are reviewed herein. There were five recent studies in healthy participants and one in patients. In a controlled setting, LSD acutely induced bliss, audiovisual synesthesia, altered meaning of perceptions, derealization, depersonalization, and mystical experiences. These subjective effects of LSD were mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor. LSD increased feelings of closeness to others, openness, trust, and suggestibility. LSD impaired the recognition of sad and fearful faces, reduced left amygdala reactivity to fearful faces, and enhanced emotional empathy. LSD increased the emotional response to music and the meaning of music. LSD acutely produced deficits in sensorimotor gating, similar to observations in schizophrenia. LSD had weak autonomic stimulant effects and elevated plasma cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin levels. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance studies showed that LSD acutely reduced the integrity of functional brain networks and increased connectivity between networks that normally are more dissociated. LSD increased functional thalamocortical connectivity and functional connectivity of the primary visual cortex with other brain areas. The latter effect was correlated with subjective hallucinations. LSD acutely induced global increases in brain entropy that were associated with greater trait openness 14 days later. In patients with anxiety associated with life-threatening disease, anxiety was reduced for 2 months after two doses of LSD. In medical settings, no complications of LSD administration were observed. These data should contribute to further investigations of the therapeutic potential of LSD in psychiatry.},

	abstract = {Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a GHB-/GABA-B receptor agonist inducing a broad spectrum of subjective effects including euphoria, disinhibition, and enhanced vitality. It is used as treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders including narcolepsy and alcohol withdrawal, but is also a drug of abuse. Non-medical users report enhancement of body and emotion awareness during intoxication. However, the neuronal underpinnings of such awareness alterations under GHB are unknown so far. The assessment of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) enables the elucidation of drug-induced functional brain alterations. Thus, we assessed the effects of GHB (35 mg/kg p.o.) in 17 healthy males on rCBF and subjective drug effects, using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over design employing arterial spin labeling phMRI. Compared to placebo, GHB increased subjective ratings for body and emotion awareness, and for dizziness (p{\textless}0.01–0.001, Bonferroni-corrected). A whole-brain analysis showed increased rCBF in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the right anterior insula under GHB (p{\textless}0.05, cluster-corrected). ACC and insula rCBF are correlated with relaxation, and body and emotion awareness (p{\textless}0.05–0.001, uncorrected). Interaction analyses revealed that GHB-induced increase of body awareness was accompanied by increased rCBF in ACC, whereas relaxation under GHB was accompanied by elevated rCBF in right anterior insula (p{\textless}0.05, uncorrected). In conclusion, enhancement of emotion and body awareness, and increased perfusion of insula and ACC bears implications both for the properties of GHB as a drug of abuse as well as for its putative personalized potential for specific therapeutic indications in affective disorders.},

	abstract = {Rationale and objectivesA potential reason that cigarette smoking can persist despite multiple quit attempts is that repeated voluntary nicotine intake may facilitate a transition from goal-directed to habitual behavioral control. Although accelerated habit formation for self-administered ethanol or cocaine has been previously demonstrated, this phenomenon has not been extensively studied with nicotine. We therefore examined the liability of nicotine self-administration to become habitual, while also examining that of orally consumed saccharin as an experimental control.MethodsUnder fixed ratio 1 (FR-1) schedules, male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8–11/group) lever-pressed for intravenous (IV) nicotine (30 μg/kg/infusion) for 10 consecutive days, while also lever-pressing for saccharin solution (0.1\% w/v, 0.19 mL/delivery) in separate operant sessions. In experiment 1, either nicotine or saccharin was devalued by pairing with the aversive agent lithium chloride (LiCl; 0.15 M, 14.1 mL/kg) prior to extinction and reacquisition testing. In experiment 2, the contingency between lever pressing and delivery of either nicotine or saccharin was degraded in six sessions, followed by extinction testing.ResultsLiCl pairings selectively reduced responding for nicotine (−35\% from control) and saccharin (−48\%) in reacquisition testing, indicating that both rewards were effectively devalued. During extinction testing, saccharin-seeking responses were reduced by both manipulations (devaluation −30\%, degradation −79\%), suggesting that responding for saccharin was goal-directed. In contrast, nicotine-seeking responses were not significantly affected by either manipulation (devaluation −4\%, degradation −21\%), suggesting that responding for nicotine was habitually driven.ConclusionsOperant responding for IV nicotine may rapidly come under habitual control, potentially contributing to the tenacity of tobacco use.},

An enzyme with these characteristics was isolated from well-washed thylakoids. Its molecular mass was estimated at 51.5 kD, and this monomer was catalytically active, although the activity was labile. The active site could be labeled with orthophosphate at pH 5.0. High levels of alkaline phosphatase activity were obtained with the assay substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (350 micromoles per minute per milligram purified enzyme). The isolated enzyme functioned as a phosphoprotein phosphatase toward phosphorylated histone III-S and phosphorylated, photosystem II-enriched particles from pea, with typical activities in the range of 200 to 600 picomoles per minute per milligram enzyme. These activities all had a pH optimum of 8.0 and were fluoride sensitive. The enzyme required magnesium ion for maximal activity but was not dependent on this ion. Evidence supporting a putative function for this phosphatase in dephosphorylation of thylakoid proteins came from the inhibition of this process by a polyclonal antibody preparation raised against the partially purified enzyme.},

Yet, the association between smoking and a key dimensional phenotype of these disorders—maladaptive deficits in fear learning and fear inhibition—is unclear. We therefore investigated acquisition and memory of fear and fear inhibition in healthy smoking and non-smoking participants (N=349, 22\% smokers). We employed a well validated paradigm of context-dependent fear and safety learning (day 1) including a memory retrieval on day 2. During fear learning, a geometrical shape was associated with an aversive electrical stimulation (classical fear conditioning, in danger context) and fear responses were extinguished within another context (extinction learning, in safe context). On day 2, the conditioned stimuli were presented again in both contexts, without any aversive stimulation. Autonomic physiological measurements of skin conductance responses as well as subjective evaluations of fear and expectancy of the aversive stimulation were acquired. We found that impairment of fear inhibition (extinction) in the safe context during learning (day 1) was associated with the amount of pack-years in smokers. During retrieval of fear memories (day 2), smokers showed an impairment of contextual (safety context-related) fear inhibition as compared with non-smokers. These effects were found in physiological as well as subjective measures of fear. We provide initial evidence that smokers as compared with non-smokers show an impairment of fear inhibition. We propose that smokers have a deficit in integrating contextual signs of safety, which is a hallmark of post-traumatic stress and anxiety disorders.},

Across studies there is consistent evidence that serotonin agonists elicit transient experiences of synaesthesia. Despite convergent results across studies, studies investigating the induction of synaesthesia with chemical agents have numerous methodological limitations and little experimental research has been conducted.

Smoking cannabis generates a large amount of unwanted side products, of which carcinogenic compounds are the most dangerous. A common practice among recreational drug users, and to a lesser degree patients who uses cannabis as medicine, is to mix the cannabis material with commercially available tobacco in order to increase the burning efficiency of the cigarette and to reduce the overall costs of the cigarette. In this study cannabis material has been mixed with tobacco in order to determine whether tobacco has an influence on the amount of and ratio between tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabinol (CBN) administered while smoking. A small-scale smoking machine has been used and cannabis mixed with various ratios of tobacco was smoked. The trapped smoke was quantitatively analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the amount of THC, CBG, and CBN was determined for each cigarette. We have found that tobacco increases the amount of THC inhaled per gram of cannabis from 32.70 +/- 2.29 mg/g for a 100\% cannabis cigarette to 58.90 +/- 2.30 mg/g for a 25\% cannabis cigarette. This indicates that tobacco increases the vaporization efficiency of THC by as much as 45\% under the conditions tested.},

This decrease is corrected by fluoxetine in doses that improve depressive symptoms. Depression-like behavioral dysfunctions (aggression, fear, and anxiety) associated with a decrease of corticolimbic Allo content can be induced in mice by social isolation. In socially isolated mice, fluoxetine and analogs stereospecifically normalize the decrease of Allo biosynthesis and improve behavioral dysfunctions by a mechanism independent from 5-HT reuptake inhibition. Thus, fluoxetine and related congeners facilitate GABAA receptor neurotransmission and effectively ameliorate emotional and anxiety disorders and depression by acting as selective brain steroidogenic stimulants (SBSSs).},

Neurosteroids are synthesized within the brain and rapidly modulate neuronal excitability. They are classified as pregnane neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, and androstane neurosteroids, such as androstanediol and etiocholanone. Neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone are positive allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors with powerful antiseizure activity in diverse animal models. Neurosteroids increases both synaptic and tonic inhibition. They are endogenous regulators of seizure susceptibility, anxiety and stress. Sulfated neurosteroids such as pregnenolone sulfate, which are negative GABA-Areceptor modulators, are memory-enhancing agents. Sex differences in susceptibility to brain disorders could be due to neurosteroids and sexual dimorphism in specific structures of the human brain. Synthetic neurosteroids that exhibit better bioavailability and efficacy and drugs that enhance neurosteroid synthesis have therapeutic potential in anxiety, epilepsy and other brain disorders. Clinical trials with the synthetic neurosteroid analog ganaxolone in the treatment of epilepsy have been encouraging. Neurosteroidogenic agents that lack benzodiazepine-like side effects show promise in the treatment of anxiety and depression.},

DNA-repair activity and repair proteins XPC and OGG1/2 are significantly reduced in the lung. We found that nicotine and its metabolite, nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone, can induce the same effects and enhance mutational susceptibility and tumorigenic transformation of cultured human bronchial epithelial and urothelial cells. These results indicate that nicotine nitrosation occurs in vivo in mice and that E-cigarette smoke is carcinogenic to the murine lung and bladder and harmful to the murine heart.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Subunit-specific modulators of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A (GABAA) receptors can help to assess the physiological function of receptors with different subunit composition and also provide the basis for the development of new drugs. Valerenic acid (VA) was recently identified as a β2/3 subunit-specific modulator of GABAA receptors with anxiolytic potential. The aim of the present study was to generate VA derivatives as novel GABAA receptor modulators and to gain insight into the structure–activity relation of this molecule.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
The carboxyl group of VA was substituted by an uncharged amide or amides with different chain length. Modulation of GABAA receptors composed of different subunit compositions by the VA derivatives was studied in Xenopus oocytes by means of the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. Half-maximal stimulation of GABA-induced chloride currents (IGABA) through GABAA receptors (EC50) and efficacies (maximal stimulation of IGABA) were estimated. Anxiolytic activity of the VA derivatives was studied in mice, applying the elevated plus maze test.

KEY RESULTS
Valerenic acid amide (VA-A) displayed the highest efficacy (more than twofold greater IGABA enhancement than VA) and highest potency (EC50= 13.7 ± 2.3 µM) on α1β3 receptors. Higher efficacy and potency of VA-A were also observed on α1β2γ2s and α3β3γ2s receptors. Anxiolytic effects were most pronounced for VA-A.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
Valerenic acid derivatives with higher efficacy and affinity can be generated. Greater in vitro action of the amide derivative correlated with a more pronounced anxiolytic effect in vivo. The data give further confidence in targeting β3 subunit containing GABAA receptors for development of anxiolytics.},

Mitochondrial function in neurons is tightly linked with metabolic and signaling mechanisms that ultimately determine neuronal performance. The subcellular distribution of these organelles is dynamically regulated as they are directed to axonal release sites on demand, but whether mitochondrial internal ultrastructure and molecular properties would reflect the actual performance requirements in a synapse-specific manner, remains to be established. Here, we examined performance-determining ultrastructural features of presynaptic mitochondria in GABAergic and glutamatergic axons of mice and human. Using electron-tomography and super-resolution microscopy we found, that these features were coupled to synaptic strength: mitochondria in boutons with high synaptic activity exhibited an ultrastructure optimized for high rate metabolism and contained higher levels of the respiratory chain protein cytochrome-c (CytC) than mitochondria in boutons with lower activity. The strong, cell type-independent correlation between mitochondrial ultrastructure, molecular fingerprints and synaptic performance suggests that changes in synaptic activity could trigger ultrastructural plasticity of presynaptic mitochondria, likely to adjust their performance to the actual metabolic demand.},

Benchmark dose values ranged from 0.004 mg/kg bodyweight for symptoms of intoxication in children to 3 mg/kg bodyweight for mortality in animals; MOEs ranged from below 1 up to 7.6 indicating a considerable consumer risk. The dimension of the MOEs is similar to those of other tobacco toxicants with high concerns relating to adverse health effects such as acrolein or formaldehyde. Owing to the lack of toxicological data in particular relating to cancer, long term animal testing studies for nicotine are urgently necessary. There is immediate need of action concerning the risk of nicotine also with regard to electronic cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.},

Novel unregulated compounds appear once older compounds become illegal. It has been previously reported that synthetic cannabinoids are different than Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) as they have chemical structures unrelated to Δ9-THC, different metabolism and, often, greater toxicity. This study aimed to investigate the effects of three novel synthetic cannabinoids and pure Δ9-THC on body temperature, nociceptive threshold, anxiety, memory function, locomotor and exploratory parameters, and depression. We performed a battery of behavioural and motor tests starting 50 minutes post i.p. injection of each drug to adult ICR mice. The synthetic cannabinoids that were used are AB-FUBINACA, AB-CHMINACA and PB-22. All synthetic cannabinoids and Δ9-THC caused hypothermia, but only Δ9-THC induced a clear antinociceptive effect. All synthetic cannabinoids and Δ9-THC caused decreased anxiety levels, spatial memory deficits and decreased exploratory behaviour as measured in the elevated plus maze, Y-maze and staircase paradigm, respectively. However, all synthetic cannabinoids but not Δ9-THC demonstrated decreased locomotor activity in the staircase test. Moreover, only AB-FUBINACA and Δ9-THC affected the gait balance and grip strength of the mice as was assessed by the latency time to fall from a rod. In the forced swimming test, PB-22 caused elevated depression-like behaviour while AB-FUBINACA induced a reversed effect. These results suggest varied effects among different synthetic cannabinoids and Δ9-THC. Further studies are needed to characterize the overall effects and differences between these synthetic cannabinoids and Δ9-THC.},

As the brain ages, the NMDA receptor system becomes progressively hypofunctional, contributing to decreases in memory and learning performance. In those individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease, other abnormalities (eg, amyloidopathy and oxidative stress) interact to increase the NMDA receptor hypofunction (NRHypo) burden. In these vulnerable individuals, the brain then enters into a severe and persistent NRHypo state, which can lead to widespread neurodegeneration with accompanying mental symptoms and further cognitive deterioration. If the hypotheses described herein prove correct, treatment implications may be considerable. Pharmacological methods for preventing the overstimulation of vulnerable corticolimbic pyramidal neurons developed in an animal model may be applicable to the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of individuals worldwide. So far, no disease-modifying drug is available to treat patients, making the search for effective drugs an urgent need. Neurodegeneration is triggered by the activation of several cellular processes, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, neuroinflammation, aging, aggregate formation, glutamatergic excitotoxicity, and apoptosis. Therefore, many research groups aim to identify drugs that may inhibit one or more of these events leading to neuronal cell death. Venoms are fruitful natural sources of new molecules, which have been relentlessly enhanced by evolution through natural selection. Several studies indicate that venom components can exhibit selectivity and affinity for a wide variety of targets in mammalian systems. For instance, an expressive number of natural peptides identified in venoms from animals, such as snakes, scorpions, bees, and spiders, were shown to lessen inflammation, regulate glutamate release, modify neurotransmitter levels, block ion channel activation, decrease the number of protein aggregates, and increase the levels of neuroprotective factors. Thus, these venom components hold potential as therapeutic tools to slow or even halt neurodegeneration. However, there are many technological issues to overcome, as venom peptides are hard to obtain and characterize and the amount obtained from natural sources is insufficient to perform all the necessary experiments and tests. Fortunately, technological improvements regarding heterologous protein expression, as well as peptide chemical synthesis will help to provide enough quantities and allow chemical and pharmacological enhancements of these natural occurring compounds. Thus, the main focus of this review is to highlight the most promising studies evaluating animal toxins as therapeutic tools to treat a wide variety of neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, brain ischemia, glaucoma, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis.},

	abstract = {5-Hydroxytryptamine2A (5-HT2A) receptors are enriched in layers I and Va of the rat prefrontal cortex and neocortex and their activation increases the frequency of glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials/currents (EPSP/Cs) onto layer V pyramidal cells. A number of other G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are also enriched in cortical layers I and Va and either induce (1-adrenergic and orexin2) or suppress (metabotropic glutamate2 [mGlu2], adenosine A1, -opioid) both 5-HT-induced EPSCs and head twitches or head shakes induced by the phenethylamine hallucinogen 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI). Another neurotransmitter receptor also localized to apparent thalamocortical afferents to layers I and Va of the rat prefrontal cortex and neocortex is the 2-adrenergic receptor. Therefore, we conducted preliminary electrophysiological experiments with rat brain slices examining the effects of epinephrine on electrically-evoked EPSPs following bath application of DOI (3 M). Epinephrine (0.3-10 M) suppressed the late EPSPs produced by electrical stimulation and DOI. The selective 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI-118,551 (300 nM) resulted in a rightward shift of the epinephrine concentration-response relationship. We also tested the selective 2-adrenergic receptor agonist clenbuterol and the antagonist ICI-118,551 on DOI-induced head twitches. Clenbuterol (0.3-3 mg/kg, i.p.) suppressed DOI(1.25 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced head twitches. This clenbuterol effect appeared to be at least partially reversed by the selective 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI-118,553 (0.01-1 mg/kg, i.p.), with significant reversal at doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg. Thus, 2-adrenergic receptor activation reverses the effects of phenethylamine hallucinogens in the rat prefrontal cortex. While Gi/Go-coupled GPCRs have previously been shown to suppress both the electrophysiological and behavioral effects of 5-HT2A receptor activation in the mPFC, the present work appears to extend this suppressant action to a Gs-coupled GPCR. Furthermore, the modulation of 5-HT2A receptor activation induced glutamate release onto mPFC layer V pyramidal neurons apical dendrites by a range GPCRs in rat brain slices appears to results in behaviorally salient effects of relevance when screening for novel CNS therapeutic drugs.},

Curcumin is a phytochemical with promising effects on epilepsy treatment. However, its application has been hindered by its low bioavailability. In order to improve curcumin’s anti-seizure properties, increasing its bioavailability, here we proposed to micronize the compound through supercritical carbon dioxide processing, a suitable green chemistry technique to prepare and modify material properties. Here we investigated the anti-seizure potential of the classical antiepileptic drug valproate, curcumin in its natural state, and micronized curcumin in a PTZ-induced seizure model in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Concerning seizure development, valproate, curcumin and micronized curcumin showed protective effects, slowing seizure development both in larvae and adult animals. Nevertheless, considering the occurrence of the tonic-clonic seizure stage, only valproate and micronized curcumin reduced it, both in larvae and adult zebrafish, unlike non-processed curcumin. Our obtained results are very promising, since micronized curcumin showed effects that are similar to a classic antiepileptic drug, reducing seizure occurrence and slowing seizure progression.},

It is not yet clear, however, which of the 14 currently identified 5-HT receptor subtypes in the brain participate in the regulation of emotional states. This study investigates a role for the 5-HT(1B) receptor subtype in anxiety-related behaviors using the elevated plus-maze paradigm in rats. The selective 5-HT(1B) receptor agonist 3-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridyl)-5-propoxypyrrolo[3,2-b]pyridine (CP 94,253; 1--5.6 mg/kg) dose-dependently decreased the amount of exploration on the open arms of the plus-maze without altering overall locomotor activity. This 5-HT(1B) agonist-induced increase in anxiety-like behavior was dose-dependently reversed by coadministration of the selective 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor antagonist 2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl[1,2,4]oxadiazol-3-yl)-biphenyl]-amide (GR 127,935). There was no significant effect of GR 127,935 administration alone on plus-maze behavior. These results indicate that 5-HT(1B) receptor activation increases anxiety-like behavioral responses as measured by the elevated plus-maze. Since 5-HT(1B) receptors modulate the activity of multiple neurotransmitter systems that have been implicated in anxiety disorders, these findings suggest that this receptor subtype may represent an important therapeutic target for the treatment of anxiety.},

Here we show that blockade of NMDAR-dependent bursting activity in the ‘anti-reward center’, the lateral habenula (LHb), mediates the rapid antidepressant actions of ketamine in rat and mouse models of depression. LHb neurons show a significant increase in burst activity and theta-band synchronization in depressive-like animals, which is reversed by ketamine. Burst-evoking photostimulation of LHb drives behavioural despair and anhedonia. Pharmacology and modelling experiments reveal that LHb bursting requires both NMDARs and low-voltage-sensitive T-type calcium channels (T-VSCCs). Furthermore, local blockade of NMDAR or T-VSCCs in the LHb is sufficient to induce rapid antidepressant effects. Our results suggest a simple model whereby ketamine quickly elevates mood by blocking NMDAR-dependent bursting activity of LHb neurons to disinhibit downstream monoaminergic reward centres, and provide a framework for developing new rapid-acting antidepressants.},

The present study aimed to determine the effects of estradiol on LHb neurons, by observing neuronal firing activity, and c‑Fos mRNA and protein expression levels in the LHb using whole cell recording, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Ovariectomized female Wistar rats were supplemented with a range of estradiol doses across five groups: Ovariectomized (no treatment); Oil (sesame oil); low estradiol; medial estradiol (ME) and high estradiol. Circulating serum estradiol levels were assessed over a 33 day period following surgery. Estradiol suppressed spontaneous firing activity in LHb neurons (P{\textless}0.05, compared with firing rates prior to estradiol treatment), which suggested a role for this hormone in regulating neuronal activity. Estradiol replacement therapy resulted in sustained serum estradiol levels for {\textasciitilde}3 weeks after surgery. The mRNA and protein levels of c‑Fos were significantly downregulated in LHb tissues from ME rats as compared with Oil animals (P{\textless}0.05).

Methylphenidate is a dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that produces altered gene expression in the forebrain; these effects partly mimic gene regulation by cocaine (dopamine/norepinephrine/serotonin reuptake inhibitor). We investigated whether the addition of SSRIs (fluoxetine or citalopram; 5 mg/kg) modified gene regulation by methylphenidate (2–5 mg/kg) in the striatum and cortex of adolescent rats. Our results show that SSRIs potentiate methylphenidate-induced expression of the transcription factors zif 268 and c-fos in the striatum, rendering these molecular changes more cocaine-like. Present throughout most of the striatum, this potentiation was most robust in its sensorimotor parts. The methylphenidate + SSRI combination also enhanced behavioral stereotypies, consistent with dysfunction in sensorimotor striatal circuits. In so far as such gene regulation is implicated in psychostimulant addiction, our findings suggest that SSRIs may enhance the addiction liability of methylphenidate.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, but few studies have investigated the efficacy of SSRIs in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sertraline in the treatment of moderate-to-severe PMS using 3 different dosing strategies: luteal phase (2 cycles), followed by continuous dosing throughout the month (1 cycle), followed by dosing begun at the first onset of PMS symptoms, or "symptom-onset" dosing (1 cycle).
METHOD: 314 women with PMS from 22 U.S. sites were randomly assigned to fixed-dose treatment with sertraline (25 or 50 mg/day) or placebo for 4 menstrual cycles after a single-blind, placebo lead-in cycle. Assessments included the Daily Symptom Report (DSR), the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness and -Improvement scales, the Patient Global Evaluation scale, the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, and the Social Adjustment Scale-Self Report.
RESULTS: Intermittent luteal-phase dosing with low doses of sertraline (25 and 50 mg/day) produced significant improvement across 2 menstrual cycles, based on total DSR scores, compared with placebo. Continuous and symptom-onset dosing were also effective in treating PMS symptoms, particularly at the lower dose of 25 mg/day.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest that low doses of sertraline may be a safe, effective, and well-tolerated treatment for moderate-to-severe PMS.},

However, no data are available on the effect of canola oil intake on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. Herein, we investigated the effect of chronic daily consumption of canola oil on the phenotype of a mouse model of AD that develops both plaques and tangles (3xTg). To this end mice received either regular chow or a chow diet supplemented with canola oil for 6 months. At this time point we found that chronic exposure to the canola-rich diet resulted in a significant increase in body weight and impairments in their working memory together with decrease levels of post-synaptic density protein-95, a marker of synaptic integrity, and an increase in the ratio of insoluble Aβ 42/40. No significant changes were observed in tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation. Taken together, our findings do not support a beneficial effect of chronic canola oil consumption on two important aspects of AD pathophysiology which includes memory impairments as well as synaptic integrity. While more studies are needed, our data do not justify the current trend aimed at replacing olive oil with canola oil.},

	abstract = {Background \& aims
The impact of marijuana on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is largely unknown. We studied the association between marijuana and NAFLD utilizing cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005–2014 and NHANES III (1988–1994).

Methods
Suspected NAFLD was diagnosed if serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was {\textgreater} 30 IU/L for men and {\textgreater} 19 IU/L for women in the absence of other liver diseases (NHANES 2005–2014). In NHANES III cohort, NAFLD was defined based on ultrasonography.

Results
Of the 14,080 (NHANES 2005–2014) and 8,286 (NHANES III) participants, prevalence of suspected NAFLD and ultrasonographically-diagnosed NAFLD were inversely associated with marijuana use (p {\textless} 0.001). Compared to marijuana-naïve participants, marijuana users were less likely to have suspected NAFLD (odds ratio [OR]: 0.90, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.82–0.99 for past user; OR: 0.68, 95\% CI: 0.58–0.80 for current user) and ultrasonographically-diagnosed NAFLD (OR: 0.75, 95\% CI: 0.57–0.98 for current user) in the age, gender, ethnicity-adjusted model. On multivariate analysis, the ORs for suspected NAFLD comparing current light or heavy users to non-users were 0.76 (95\% CI 0.58–0.98) and 0.70 (95\% CI 0.56–0.89), respectively (P for trend = 0.001) with similar trends in ultrasonographically-diagnosed NAFLD (OR: 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.59–1.00 for current user; OR: 0.71, 95\% CI: 0.51–0.97 for current light user). In insulin resistance-adjusted model, marijuana use remained an independent predictor of lower risk of suspected NAFLD.

Conclusions
In this nationally representative sample, active marijuana use provided a protective effect against NAFLD independent of known metabolic risk factors. The pathophysiology is unclear and warrants further investigation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are limited data regarding the relationship between cannabinoids and metabolic processes. Epidemiologic studies have found lower prevalence rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus in marijuana users compared with people who have never used marijuana, suggesting a relationship between cannabinoids and peripheral metabolic processes. To date, no study has investigated the relationship between marijuana use and fasting insulin, glucose, and insulin resistance.
METHODS: We included 4657 adult men and women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2005 to 2010. Marijuana use was assessed by self-report in a private room. Fasting insulin and glucose were measured via blood samples after a 9-hour fast, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated to evaluate insulin resistance. Associations were estimated using multiple linear regression, accounting for survey design and adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Of the participants in our study sample, 579 were current marijuana users and 1975 were past users. In multivariable adjusted models, current marijuana use was associated with 16\% lower fasting insulin levels (95\% confidence interval [CI], -26, -6) and 17\% lower HOMA-IR (95\% CI,Â -27, -6). We found significant associations between marijuana use and smaller waist circumferences. Among current users, we found no significant dose-response.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that marijuana use was associated with lower levels of fasting insulin and HOMA-IR, and smaller waist circumference.},

Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) is a neutral CB1 antagonist producing hypophagia and body weight reduction in lean mice. We investigated its effects in dietary-induced (DIO) and genetically (ob/ob) obese mice.Methods:We performed two dose-ranging studies in DIO mice; study 1: 0.3, 1, 2.5, 5 and 12.5 mg kg−1, oral twice daily for 30 days and study 2: 0.1, 0.5, 2.5 and 12.5 mg kg−1, oral, once daily for 45 days. One pilot (study 3: 0.3 and 3 mg kg−1, oral, once daily) and one full dose-ranging (study 4: 0.1, 0.5, 2.5 and 12.5 mg kg−1, oral, once daily) studies in ob/ob mice for 30 days. The CB1 inverse agonist, AM251, oral, 10 mg kg−1 once daily or 5 mg kg−1 twice daily was used as the positive control. Cumulative food and water intake, body weight gain, energy expenditure, glucose and insulin levels (fasting or during oral glucose tolerance tests), plasma high-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol, and liver triglycerides were measured. HL-5 hepatocytes or C2C12 myotubes made insulin-resistant with chronic insulin or palmitic acid were treated with 0, 1, 3 and 10 μM THCV or AM251.Results:THCV did not significantly affect food intake or body weight gain in any of the studies, but produced an early and transient increase in energy expenditure. It dose-dependently reduced glucose intolerance in ob/ob mice and improved glucose tolerance and increased insulin sensitivity in DIO mice, without consistently affecting plasma lipids. THCV also restored insulin signalling in insulin-resistant hepatocytes and myotubes.Conclusions:THCV is a new potential treatment against obesity-associated glucose intolerance with pharmacology different from that of CB1 inverse agonists/antagonists.},

	abstract = {Hallucinations, a cardinal feature of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, are known to depend on excessive striatal dopamine. However, an underlying cognitive mechanism linking dopamine dysregulation and the experience of hallucinatory percepts remains elusive. Bayesian models explain perception as an optimal combination of prior expectations and new sensory evidence, where perceptual distortions such as illusions and hallucinations may occur if prior expectations are afforded excessive weight. Such excessive weight of prior expectations, in turn, could stem from a gain-control process controlled by neuromodulators such as dopamine. To test for such a dopamine-dependent gain-control mechanism of hallucinations, we studied unmedicated patients with schizophrenia with varying degrees of hallucination severity and healthy individuals using molecular imaging with a pharmacological manipulation of dopamine, structural imaging, and a novel task designed to measure illusory changes in the perceived duration of auditory stimuli under different levels of uncertainty. Hallucinations correlated with a perceptual bias, reflecting disproportional gain on expectations under uncertainty. This bias could be pharmacologically induced by amphetamine, strongly correlated with striatal dopamine release, and related to cortical volume of the dorsal anterior cingulate, a brain region involved in tracking environmental uncertainty. These findings outline a novel dopamine-dependent mechanism for perceptual modulation in physiological conditions and further suggest that this mechanism may confer vulnerability to hallucinations in hyper-dopaminergic states underlying psychosis.},

	abstract = {RationaleDepressive episodes are the leading cause of mental health-related hospital admissions in Australia, and 44\% of those admitted have a previous history of hospitalisations for depression (Admitted patient mental health-related care: (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Aust Hospital Stat 2011–12, 2013). Despite numerous available antidepressant treatments, many patients do not respond to conventional therapy, having what is called ‘treatment resistance’ (Fava Biol Psychiatry 53:649–659, 2003). In recent years, ketamine has risen to prominence as an effective, rapidly acting antidepressant (Ketamine: a light in the darkness: Paleos and Ross 28–33, 2013). However, customary intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) routes of administration and relapse rates after cessation remain barriers to more widely adopted usage.ObjectivesThis study represents the largest retrospective review of patients receiving long-term oral ketamine for treatment-resistant depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our purpose was to examine the safety and efficacy of oral ketamine therapy in an outpatient setting as measured by changes in hospitalisation for psychiatric episodes.MethodsHospital records of 37 patients who received oral ketamine treatment were reviewed to compare the number and duration of psychiatric hospital admissions before and after treatment. Records were also screened for adverse medical events and changes in ketamine dosage over time.ResultsFollowing treatment, inpatient hospital days were reduced by 70\%, and hospital admissions were reduced by 65\%. The dose of ketamine patients required was stable over time with no evidence of tolerance building. There were no serious adverse events and no long-term negative effects associated with ketamine.ConclusionsOral ketamine offers a promising pharmacologic adjunct to depression treatment. It may offer a more approachable alternative to IV or IM ketamine. The results warrant further investigation into the safety and efficacy of oral ketamine for psychiatric treatment.},

Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Various subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects were assessed after drug administration.ResultsHigh doses of both drugs produced similar increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength, with similar times to maximal effect and time-course. Psilocybin produced orderly dose-related increases on most participant-rated subjective measures previously shown sensitive to hallucinogens. DXM produced increases on most of these same measures. However, the high dose of psilocybin produced significantly greater and more diverse visual effects than DXM including greater movement and more frequent, brighter, distinctive, and complex (including textured and kaleidoscopic) images and visions. Compared to DXM, psilocybin also produced significantly greater mystical-type and psychologically insightful experiences and greater absorption in music. In contrast, DXM produced larger effects than psilocybin on measures of disembodiment, nausea/emesis, and light-headedness. Both drugs increased systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupil dilation and decreased psychomotor performance and balance.ConclusionsPsilocybin and DXM produced similar profiles of subjective experiences, with psilocybin producing relatively greater visual, mystical-type, insightful, and musical experiences, and DXM producing greater disembodiment.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Pharmacological challenges with hallucinogens are used as models for psychosis in experimental research. The state induced by glutamate antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) is often considered as a more appropriate model of psychosis than the state induced by serotonergic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). However, so far, the psychological profiles of the two types of hallucinogenic drugs have never been studied directly in an experimental within-subject design.
METHODS: Fifteen healthy volunteers were included in a double-blind, cross-over study with two doses of the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist DMT and the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist (S)-ketamine.
RESULTS: Data are reported for nine subjects who completed both experimental days with both doses of the two drugs. The intensity of global psychological effects was similar for DMT and (S)-ketamine. However, phenomena resembling positive symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly positive formal thought disorder and inappropriate affect, were stronger after DMT. Phenomena resembling negative symptoms of schizophrenia, attention deficits, body perception disturbances and catatonia-like motor phenomena were stronger after (S)-ketamine.
DISCUSSION: The present study suggests that the NMDA antagonist model of psychosis is not overall superior to the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist model. Rather, the two classes of drugs tend to model different aspects or types of schizophrenia. The NMDA antagonist state may be an appropriate model for psychoses with prominent negative and possibly also catatonic features, while the 5-HT2A agonist state may be a better model for psychoses of the paranoid type.},

The experimental pain tests (order randomized) were heat, cold, pressure, single and repeated transcutaneous electrical stimulation. Additionally, reaction time, side-effects (visual analog scales), and vital functions were monitored. For the pharmacokinetic profiling, blood samples were collected. THC did not significantly reduce pain. In the cold and heat tests it even produced hyperalgesia, which was completely neutralized by THC-morphine. A slight additive analgesic effect could be observed for THC-morphine in the electrical stimulation test. No analgesic effect resulted in the pressure and heat test, neither with THC nor THC-morphine. Psychotropic and somatic side-effects (sleepiness, euphoria, anxiety, confusion, nausea, dizziness, etc.) were common, but usually mild.},

	abstract = {Summary. Several lines of behavioral and neurochemical evidence indicate GABAA-antagonistic properties of naloxone. Here, the effects of naloxone on rat brain GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor function in vitro were investigated. Naloxone, naltrexone and morphine (10–1,000 μM) reduced GABA-induced (10 μM) 36Cl− uptake in corticohippocampal synaptoneurosomes. Furthermore, the concentration-response curve for GABA-induced 36Cl− uptake (GABA 3–100 μM) was shifted to the right both by naloxone and morphine (1,000 μM). Naloxone also reduced the 36Cl− uptake induced by GABA + diazepam (3 μM + 1 μM) but not that induced by amobarbital (500 μM). The naloxone-induced (1,000 μM) reduction of GABA-mediated (10 μM) 36Cl− uptake was reversed by amobarbital (10–1,000 μM) but not by flumazenil (10–1,000 μM) or morphine (0.1–1,000 μM). These results indicate that naloxone, naltrexone and morphine are weak negative modulators of GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor function. The naloxone effect most likely does not involve opiate receptors or the benzodiazepine site on GABAA receptor complexes.},

Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are available; however, because of inadequate resources, antidepressants are used more frequently than psychological interventions.

We included placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 21 antidepressants used for the acute treatment of adults (≥18 years old and of both sexes) with major depressive disorder diagnosed according to standard operationalised criteria. We excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials that were incomplete or included 20\% or more of participants with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or treatment-resistant depression; or patients with a serious concomitant medical illness. We extracted data following a predefined hierarchy. In network meta-analysis, we used group-level data. We assessed the studies' risk of bias in accordance to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework.

For acceptability, only agomelatine (OR 0·84, 95\% CrI 0·72–0·97) and fluoxetine (0·88, 0·80–0·96) were associated with fewer dropouts than placebo, whereas clomipramine was worse than placebo (1·30, 1·01–1·68). When all trials were considered, differences in ORs between antidepressants ranged from 1·15 to 1·55 for efficacy and from 0·64 to 0·83 for acceptability, with wide CrIs on most of the comparative analyses. In head-to-head studies, agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine were more effective than other antidepressants (range of ORs 1·19–1·96), whereas fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, and trazodone were the least efficacious drugs (0·51–0·84).

A set of biochemical parameters is available which distinguishes between the three. In addition, actions of the drugs result in physiological and behavioural effects which are distinguishable. beta-Carboline derivatives provide a group of compounds which show high affinity for the benzodiazepine sites, and which contains examples belonging to each of the three categories. Evidence is reviewed which shows that beta-carboline benzodiazepine receptor agonists (ZK 93423, ZK 91296) produce increases in the consumption of a palatable diet by non-deprived rats, that beta-carboline inverse agonists (FG 7142, DMCM) produce an anorectic effect, and that the beta-carboline ZK 93426 acts as a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. The results support the proposal of bi-directional control of feeding responses through the action of drugs at a common benzodiazepine receptor. Furthermore, benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists provide a novel class of anorectic agents. Evidence is also reviewed which is suggestive of the modulation of food-related reward by drug actions at benzodiazepine receptors.},

	abstract = {Previous attempts to identify a unified theory of brain serotonin function have largely failed to achieve consensus. In this present synthesis, we integrate previous perspectives with new and older data to create a novel bipartite model centred on the view that serotonin neurotransmission enhances two distinct adaptive responses to adversity, mediated in large part by its two most prevalent and researched brain receptors: the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. We propose that passive coping (i.e. tolerating a source of stress) is mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling and characterised by stress moderation. Conversely, we argue that active coping (i.e. actively addressing a source of stress) is mediated by 5-HT2AR signalling and characterised by enhanced plasticity (defined as capacity for change). We propose that 5-HT1AR-mediated stress moderation may be the brain’s default response to adversity but that an improved ability to change one’s situation and/or relationship to it via 5-HT2AR-mediated plasticity may also be important – and increasingly so as the level of adversity reaches a critical point. We propose that the 5-HT1AR pathway is enhanced by conventional 5-HT reuptake blocking antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), whereas the 5-HT2AR pathway is enhanced by 5-HT2AR-agonist psychedelics. This bipartite model purports to explain how different drugs (SSRIs and psychedelics) that modulate the serotonergic system in different ways, can achieve complementary adaptive and potentially therapeutic outcomes.},

	abstract = {The addiction model is rarely used to describe high-frequency use of visual sexual stimuli (VSS) in research, yet common in media and clinical practice. The theory and research behind ‘pornography addiction’ is hindered by poor experimental designs, limited methodological rigor, and lack of model specification. The history and limitations of addiction models are reviewed, including how VSS fails to meet standards of addiction. These include how VSS use can reduce health-risk behaviors. Proposed negative effects, including erectile problems, difficulty regulating sexual feelings, and neuroadaptations are discussed as non-pathological evidence of learning. Individuals reporting ‘addictive’ use of VSS could be better conceptualized by considering issues such as gender, sexual orientation, libido, desire for sensation, with internal and external conflicts influenced by religiosity and desire discrepancy. Since a large, lucrative industry has promised treatments for pornography addiction despite this poor evidence, scientific psychologists are called to declare the emperor (treatment industry) has no clothes (supporting evidence). When faced with such complaints, clinicians are encouraged to address behaviors without conjuring addiction labels.},

Here, we used a machine learning algorithm applied to natural speech to ask whether language properties measured before psilocybin for treatment-resistant can predict for which patients it will be effective and for which it will not.
METHODS: A baseline autobiographical memory interview was conducted and transcribed. Patients with treatment-resistant depression received 2 doses of psilocybin, 10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart. Psychological support was provided before, during and after all dosing sessions. Quantitative speech measures were applied to the interview data from 17 patients and 18 untreated age-matched healthy control subjects. A machine learning algorithm was used to classify between controls and patients and predict treatment response.
RESULTS: Speech analytics and machine learning successfully differentiated depressed patients from healthy controls and identified treatment responders from non-responders with a significant level of 85\% of accuracy (75\% precision).
CONCLUSIONS: Automatic natural language analysis was used to predict effective response to treatment with psilocybin, suggesting that these tools offer a highly cost-effective facility for screening individuals for treatment suitability and sensitivity.
LIMITATIONS: The sample size was small and replication is required to strengthen inferences on these results.},

Thus, high blood alcohol concentration (BAC), as seen in alcoholics, can cause significant damage to various organs. At low concentrations (e.g., 10 mg\% or lower), however, beneficial effects of alcohol, particularly on cardiovascular function have been reported. Although, the latter assertion has been challenged by recent epidemiological studies, protective effects of low alcohol concentrations in vitro and in vivo relevant to the central nervous system (CNS) is well documented. In this review, the mechanism(s) leading to the detrimental effects of high BAC, as well as the beneficial effects of low BAC will be discussed. In addition, gender consideration is touched upon. Although further investigation is clearly warranted, it may be concluded that at least some of the beneficial outcomes of low BAC, including possible neuroprotection and antidepressant-like effects, may be due to elevation of the neurotropic factors and reduction of inflammatory mediators, whereas detrimental outcomes associated with high BAC, including neurotoxicity and depressive-like behavior may be due to reduction in neurotropic factors and elevation of inflammatory mediators.

	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Extracts from and alkaloids contained in plants in the genus Sceletium have been reported to inhibit ligand binding to serotonin transporter. From this, the conclusion was made that Sceletium products act as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors. However, other mechanisms which may similarly result in the anxiolytic or anti-depressant effect ascribed to Sceletium, such as monoamine release, have not been investigated.
AIMS OF THE STUDY: The current study investigated simultaneously and at two consecutive time points, the effect of high-mesembrine Sceletium extract on both monoamine release and serotonin reuptake into both human astrocytes and mouse hippocampal neurons, as well as potential inhibitory effects on relevant enzyme activities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human astrocytes and mouse hippocampal cells were treated with citalopram or Sceletium extract for 15 and 30min, after which protein expression levels of serotonin transporter (SERT) and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VAMT-2) was assessed using fluorescent immunocytochemistry and digital image analysis. Efficacy of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidate-A (MAO-A) activity were assessed using the Ellman and Olsen methods (and appropriate controls) respectively.
RESULTS: We report the first investigation of mechanism of action of Sceletium extract in the context of serotonin transport, release and reuptake in a cellular model. Cell viability was not affected by Sceletium treatment. High-mesembrine Sceletium extract down-regulated SERT expression similarly to citalopram. In addition, VMAT-2 was upregulated significantly in response to Sceletium treatment. The extract showed only relatively mild inhibition of AChE and MAO-A.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the serotonin reuptake inhibition activity ascribed to the Sceletium plant, is a secondary function to the monoamine-releasing activity of high-mesembrine Sceletium extract (Trimesemine(TM)).},

First, I describe the subjective phenomenology of acute psychedelic effects using the best available empirical data. Next, I review late 19th-century and early 20th-century theories—model psychoses theory, filtration theory, and psychoanalytic theory—and highlight their shared theoretical features. I then briefly review recent neuropharmacological and neurophysiological findings. Finally, I describe some recent theories of psychedelic drug effects that leverage 21st-century cognitive neuroscience frameworks—entropic brain theory, integrated information theory, and predictive processing—highlighting their shared theoretical features and pointing out how they link back to earlier theories. From this analysis a key theoretical concept is identified which cuts across many theories past and present: psychedelic drugs perturb specific brain processes which normally sustain constraints on perceptual, affective, cognitive, and self-related neural systems. While a truly unifying theory has yet to emerge, I suggest that the enduring theoretical features and formalized frameworks highlighted in this article could form a groundwork for future unifying theories of psychedelic drug effects.},

	abstract = {Cannabinoids (CBs) have recently been approved to exert broad anti-inflammatory activities in experimental models of multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been demonstrated that these compounds could also have effects on neurodegeneration, demyelination, and autoimmune processes occurring in the pathology of MS. However, the clinical use of CBs is limited by their psychoactive effects. Among cannabinoid compounds, cannabidiol (CBD) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) have no psychotropic activities. We induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, by injecting myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) to C57BL/6 mice. We assessed the effects of CBD, PEA, and co-administration of CBD and PEA on neurobehavioral scores, immune cell infiltration, demyelination, axonal injury, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines by using histochemistry methods and real-time RT-PCR. Treatment with either CBD (5mg/kg) or PEA (5mg/kg) during disease onset reduced the severity of the neurobehavioral scores of EAE. This effect of CBD and PEA was accompanied by diminished inflammation, demyelination, axonal damage and inflammatory cytokine expression while concurrent administration of CBD (5mg/kg) and PEA (5mg/kg) was not as effective as treatment with either drug per se. These results suggest that, CBD and PEA, non-psychoactive CBs, attenuate neurobehavioral deficits, histological damage, and inflammatory cytokine expression in MOG-immunized animals. However, there is an antagonistic interaction between CBD and PEA in protection against MOG-induced disease.},

Here we show that constitutive deletion of the mGlu2 gene profoundly attenuates an effect of 5-HT2A receptor activation using the mouse head twitch response (HTR). MGlu2 and mGlu3 receptor knockout (KO) as well as age-matched ICR (CD-1) wild type (WT) mice were administered (Â±)1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) and observed for head twitch activity. DOI failed to produce significant head twitches in mGlu2 receptor KO mice at a dose 10-fold higher than the peak effective dose in WT or mGlu3 receptor KO mice. In addition, the mGlu2/3 receptor agonist LY379268, and the mGlu2 receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM) CBiPES, potently blocked the HTR to DOI in WT and mGlu3 receptor KO mice. Conversely, the mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist LY341495 (10 mg/kg) increased the HTR produced by DOI (3 mg/kg) in mGlu3 receptor KO mice. Finally, the mGlu2 receptor potentiator CBiPES was able to attenuate the increase in the HTR produced by LY341495 in mGlu3 receptor KO mice. Taken together, all of these results are consistent with the hypothesis that that DOI-induced head twitches are modulated by mGlu2 receptor activation. These results also are in keeping with a critical autoreceptor function for mGlu2 receptors in the prefrontal cortex with differential effects of acute vs chronic perturbation (e.g., constitutive mGlu2 receptor KO mice). The robust attenuation of DOI-induced head twitches in the mGlu2 receptor KO mice appears to reflect the critical role of glutamate in ongoing regulation of 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex. Future experiments with inducible knockouts for the mGlu2 receptor and/or selective mGlu3 receptor agonists/PAMs/antagonists could provide an important tools in understanding glutamatergic modulation of prefrontal cortical 5-HT2A receptor function.},

	abstract = {Dopamine, serotonin and glutamate play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In the brain a functional crosstalk between the serotonin receptor 5-HT(2A) and the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGlu(2) has been demonstrated. Such a crosstalk may be mediated indirectly through neuronal networks or directly by receptor oligomerization. A direct link of the 5-HT(2A)-mGlu(2) heterocomplex formation to receptor function, i.e. to intracellular signaling, has not been fully demonstrated yet. Here we confirm the formation of 5-HT(2A)-mGlu(2) heterocomplexes using quantitative Snap/Clip-tag based HTRF methods. Additionally, mGlu(2) formed complexes with 5-HT(2B) and mGlu(5) but not 5-HT(2C) indicating that complex formation is not specific to the 5-HT(2A)-mGlu(2) pair. We studied the functional consequences of the 5-HT(2A)-mGlu(2) heterocomplex addressing cellular signaling pathways. Co-expression of receptors in HEK-293 cells had no relevant effects on signaling mediated by the individual receptors when mGlu(2) agonists, antagonists and PAMs, or 5-HT(2A) hallucinogenic and non-hallucinogenic agonists and antagonists were used. Hallucinogenic 5-HT(2A) agonists induced signaling through G(q/11), but not G(i) and thus did not lead to modulation of intracellular cAMP levels. In membranes of the medial prefrontal cortex [(3)H]-LY341495 binding competition of mGlu(2/3) agonist LY354740 was not influenced by 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI). Taken together, the formation of GPCR heterocomplexes does not necessarily translate into second messenger effects. These results do not put into question the well-documented functional cross-talk of the two receptors in the brain, but do challenge the biological relevance of the 5-HT(2A)-mGlu(2) heterocomplex.},

It has been reported that 2C-B induces mild psychedelic effects, although its acute pharmacological effects and pharmacokinetics have not yet been fully studied in humans. An observational study was conducted to assess the acute subjective and physiological effects, as well as pharmacokinetics of 2C-B. Sixteen healthy, experienced drug users self-administered an oral dose of 2C-B (10, 15, or 20 mg). Vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) were measured at baseline 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours (h). Each participant completed subjective effects using three rating scales: Visual Analogue Scales (VAS), the Addiction Research Centre Inventory (ARCI), and Evaluation of the Subjective Effects of Substances with Abuse Potential (VESSPA-SSE) at baseline, 2-3 h, and 6 h after self-administration (maximum effects along 6 h), and the Hallucinogenic Rating Scale (HRS) (maximum effects along 6 h). Oral fluid (saliva) was collected to assess 2C-B and cortisol concentrations during 24 h. Acute administration of 2C-B increased blood pressure and heart rate. Scores of scales related to euphoria increased (high, liking and stimulated), and changes in perceptions (distances, colors, shapes and lights) and different body feelings/surrounding were produced. Mild hallucinating effects were described in 5 subjects. Maximum concentrations of 2C-B and cortisol were reached at 1 h and 3 h after self-administration, respectively. Oral 2C-B at recreational doses induces a constellation of psychedelic/psychostimulant-like effects similar to those associated with serotonin-acting drugs.},

	abstract = {Benzydamine (BZY) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used for the topical treatment of inflammations of the oral and vaginal mucosae. Virtually nothing is known about the central pharmacological actions of BZY. Yet there are reports of voluntary systemic overdosage of BZY in drug addicts, resulting in a euphoric, hallucinatory state. In the present study, we investigated the reinforcing properties of BZY in a rat self-administration paradigm. We found that BZY has a powerful reinforcing effect and that this effect is greatly facilitated in animals that already had substance experience, having previously self-administered heroin and cocaine, indicating cross sensitization between BZY and other common drugs of abuse. We then assessed the effect of BZY on prelimbic cortex-to-nucleus accumbens glutamatergic transmission, using field recordings in rat parasagittal brain slices. BZY dose-dependently reduced both field excitatory post synaptic potential amplitude and paired pulse ratio, suggesting a presynaptic mechanism of action. Similarly to the in vivo paradigm, also the electrophysiological effects of BZY were potentiated in slices from animals that had undergone cocaine and heroin self-administration. Furthermore, BZY-induced Long Term Depression (LTD)-like responses in the prelimbic cortex-to-nucleus accumbens circuitry were significantly reduced in the presence of the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251. These findings provide firm evidence of the abuse liability of BZY and suggest a possible cannabinoidergic mechanism of action. Further research is needed in order to give insights into the molecular mechanism underlying BZY psychoactive and reinforcing effects, to better understand its abuse potential.},

	abstract = {Background: The therapeutic effects of the Amazonian plant tea ayahuasca may relate to its ability to enhance mindfulness capacities. Ayahuasca induces a modified state of awareness through the combined action of its active principles: the psychedelic N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and a series of centrally-acting β-carbolines, mainly harmine and tetrahydroharmine. To better understand the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca, here we compared the impact on mindfulness capacities induced by two independent interventions: a) participation in four ayahuasca sessions without any specific purpose related to improving mindfulness capacities; and b) participation in a standard mindfulness training course: 8 weeks mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), with the specific goal of improving these skills. Methods: Participants of two independent groups completed two self-report instruments: The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and the Experiences Questionnaire (EQ). The MINDSENS Composite Index was also calculated, including those EQ and FFMQ items that have proven to be the most sensitive to meditation practice. Group A (n=10) was assessed before and after the last of four closely-spaced consecutive ayahuasca sessions. Group B (n=10) was assessed before and after completion of a standard eight-week MBSR course. Results: MBSR training led to greater increases in overall mindfulness scores after the eight-week period. MBSR but not ayahuasca led to increases in the MINDSENS Composite Index. However, the ayahuasca sessions induced comparable increases in the Non-Judging subscale of the FFMQ, specifically measuring “acceptance”. Improving this capacity allows for a more detached and less judgmental stance towards potentially distressing thoughts and emotions. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that a small number of ayahuasca sessions can be as effective at improving acceptance as more lengthy and costly interventions. Future studies should address the benefits of combining ayahuasca administration with mindfulness-based interventions. This will allow us to investigate if ayahuasca will improve the outcome of psychotherapeutic interventions.},

We hypothesize that alcohol abuse may have a detrimental effect on the neurogenic pool of the dentate gyrus in the human hippocampus. In this study we investigate whether alcohol abuse affects the number of proliferating cells, stem/progenitor cells, and immature neurons in samples from postmortem human hippocampus. The specimens were isolated from deceased donors with an on-going alcohol abuse, and from controls with no alcohol overconsumption. Mid-hippocampal sections were immunostained for Ki67, a marker for cell proliferation, Sox2, a stem/progenitor cell marker, and DCX, a marker for immature neurons. Immunoreactivity was counted in alcoholic subjects and compared with controls. Counting was performed in the three layers of dentate gyrus: the subgranular zone, the granular cell layer, and the molecular layer. Our data showed reduced numbers of all three markers in the dentate gyrus in subjects with an on-going alcohol abuse. This reduction was most prominent in the subgranular zone, and uniformly distributed across the distances from the granular cell layer. Furthermore, alcohol abusers showed a more pronounced reduction of Sox2-IR cells than DCX-IR cells, suggesting that alcohol primarily causes a depletion of the stem/progenitor cell pool and that immature neurons are secondarily affected. These results are in agreement with observations of impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis in animal studies and lend further support for the association between hippocampal dysfunction and alcohol abuse.},

The present study aimed to investigate the role of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in MDMA-induced mood effects. Four placebo-controlled, within-subject studies were pooled, including in total 63 polydrug ecstasy users (Ns-group = 48; Nl-group = 15) receiving MDMA 75 mg and placebo on two test days, separated by minimally 7 days. Mood was assessed by means of the Profile of Mood States. Findings showed that MDMA induced –independent of sex- a positive mood state, and as a side effect also increased two negative affect states, anxiety and confusion. Anxiety ratings were higher in the l-group and independent of treatment or sex. Depression ratings were lowered by MDMA in the female l-group. Findings indicate that the MDMA-induced reduction in self-rated depressive feelings is sex- and genotype-dependent, with females homozygous for the l-allele showing this beneficial effect.},

MDMA-engendered neurotoxicity has been shown to be affected by both ambient temperature and core body temperature. We now report that small (2 degreesC) changes in ambient temperature produce changes in core temperature in MDMA-treated rats, but the same changes in ambient temperature do not affect core temperature of saline-treated animals. Furthermore, increases in core temperature of MDMA-treated animals increase neurotoxicity. Rats were given MDMA (20 or 40 mg/kg) or saline and placed in an ambient temperature of 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, or 30 degreesC using a novel temperature measurement apparatus that controls ambient temperature +/-0.5 degrees C. Two weeks after MDMA treatment, the rats were killed, and regional 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid levels were analyzed as a measure of neurotoxicity. Rats treated with MDMA at 20 and 22 degrees C showed a hypothermic core temperature response. Treatment with MDMA at 28 and 30 degreesC produced a hyperthermic response. At ambient temperatures of 20-24 degrees C, neurotoxicity was not observed in the frontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, or striatum. At ambient temperatures of 26-30 degrees C, neurotoxicity was seen and correlated with core temperature in all regions examined. These data indicate that ambient temperature has a significant affect on MDMA neurotoxicity, core temperature, and thermoregulation in rats. This finding has implications on both the temperature dependence of the mechanism of MDMA neurotoxicity and human use because fatal hyperthermia is associated with MDMA use in humans.},

MDMA produced significant (P {\textless} .05) decreases in 5-HT and 5-hydroxindole acetic acid levels in the frontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, striatum and hippocampus, and pretreatment with KET or AMPT prevented these depletions. When rats were given the KET/MDMA or AMPT/MDMA drug injections and warmed to prevent hypothermia, the protection against neurotoxicity was removed, which indicated that the hypothermia mediated the protective effects of KET and AMPT. In comparison with the hypothermia seen with AMPT or KET pretreatment, pretreatment with FLUOX had no effect on CORE TEMP. The rats given the FLUOX/MDMA treatment did not have different CORE TEMPs than rats given SAL/MDMA. The FLUOX pretreatment protected against MDMA-induced 5-HT and 5-hydroxindole acetic acid depletions in the frontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, striatum and hippocampus. This study suggests that a decrease in CORE TEMP may be a mechanism of protection against MDMA neurotoxicity by some drugs but that there is also a mechanism of protection that is independent of a change in body temperature.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: At least 10-20\% of the patients suffering from depression meet criteria for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In the last decades, an important role of glutamate in mood modulation has been hypothesized and ketamine, a non noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, has been demonstrated to be effective in both MDD and TRD. However, concerns emerged about the optimal dosage, and frequency of administration of this treatment.
METHODS: aiming to systematically review the current literature focusing on the main pharmacological properties and impact of ketamine in TRD, a detailed literature search in PubMed/Medline and ScienceDirect databases was conducted. Twenty-four manuscripts including a total of 416 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Most studies demonstrated that the NMDA antagonist ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects in TRD patients, confirming the active role of glutamate in the pathophysiology of this complex condition. Ketamine has been demonstrated to be rapidly effective and was associated with a significant clinical improvement in depressive symptoms within hours after administration. Also, ketamine was also found to be effective in reducing suicidality in TRD samples.
LIMITATIONS: The long-term efficacy of ketamine has not been investigated by most studies. The psychotomimetic properties may complicate the application of this pharmacological agent.
CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine may be considered a valid and intriguing antidepressant option for the treatment of TRD. Further studies are needed to evaluate its long-term antidepressant efficacy in patients with TRD.},

	abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is frequently observed in prokaryotes and until recently was assumed to be of limited importance to eukaryotes. However, there is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that HGT is an important mechanism in eukaryotic genome evolution, particularly in unicellular organisms. The transfer of individual genes, gene clusters or entire chromosomes can have significant impacts on niche specification, disease emergence or shift in metabolic capabilities. In terms of genomic sequencing, the fungal kingdom is one of the most densely sampled eukaryotic lineages and is at the forefront of eukaryote comparative genomics and enables us to use fungi to study eukaryotic evolutionary mechanisms including HGT. This review describes the bioinformatics-based methodologies commonly used to locate HGT in fungal genomes and investigates the possible mechanisms involved in transferring genetic material laterally into fungal species. I will highlight a number of fungal HGT events and discuss the impact they have played on fungal evolution and discuss the implications HGT may have on the fungal tree of life.},

The results showed that those given caffeine reported greater alertness and anxiety at the end of the test session, as well as improved performance on choice reaction time tasks involving focused attention and categoric search, a semantic memory task and a delayed recognition memory task.

	abstract = {Ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist, has emerged as an increasingly popular drug among young drug abusers worldwide. Available evidence suggests that ketamine produces acute impairments of working, episodic and semantic memory along with psychotogenic and dissociative effects when a single dose is given to healthy volunteers. However, understanding of the possible chronic effects of ketamine on behavior, cognitive anomalies and neurochemical homeostasis is still incomplete. Although previous human studies demonstrate that ketamine could impair a range of cognitive skills, investigation using non-human models would permit more precise exploration of the neurochemical mechanisms which may underlie the detrimental effects. The current study examined the abnormalities in behavior (move, walk, jump and climb) and apoptosis of the prefrontal cortex using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and apoptotic markers, including Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 in adolescent male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) after 1 or 6 months of sub-anesthetic ketamine administration (1 mg/kg, i.v.). Results showed that ketamine decreased locomotor activity and increased cell death in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys with 6 months of ketamine treatment when compared with the control monkeys. Such decreases were not found in the 1-month ketamine-treated group. Our study suggested that ketamine administration of recreational dose in monkeys might produce permanent and irreversible deficits in brain functions due to neurotoxic effects, involving the activation of apoptotic pathways in the prefrontal cortex.},

In addition, the beneficial effects appear to persist well after limited exposure to the drugs, making them particularly appealing as treatments for chronic neuropsychiatric and headache disorders. Understanding the basis of the long-lasting effects, however, will be critical for the continued use and development of this drug class. Several mechanisms, including biological and psychological ones, have been suggested to explain the long-lasting effects of psychedelics. Actions on the neuroendocrine system are some such mechanisms that warrant further investigation in the study of persisting psychedelic effects. In this report, we review certain structural and functional neuroendocrinological pathologies associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and cluster headache. We then review the effects that psychedelic drugs have on those systems and provide preliminary support for potential long-term effects. The circadian biology of cluster headache is of particular relevance in this area. We also discuss methodologic considerations for future investigations of neuroendocrine system involvement in the therapeutic benefits of psychedelic drugs.},

How do these effects relate to the clinical efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapies? Efforts to understand psychedelic phenomena date back more than a century in Western science. In this article I review scientific theories of psychedelic drug effects and highlight key theoretical features which have endured over the last 125 years of psychedelic science. First, I describe the subjective phenomenology of acute psychedelic effects using the best available empirical data. Next, I review late 19th-century and early 20th-century theories—model psychoses theory, filtration theory, and psychoanalytic theory—and highlight their shared theoretical features. I then briefly review recent neuropharmacological and neurophysiological findings. Finally, I describe some recent theories of psychedelic drug effects that leverage 21st-century cognitive neuroscience frameworks—entropic brain theory, integrated information theory, and predictive processing—highlighting their shared theoretical features and pointing out how they link back to earlier theories. From this analysis a key theoretical concept is identified which cuts across many theories past and present: psychedelic drugs perturb specific brain processes which normally sustain constraints on perceptual, affective, cognitive, and self-related neural systems. While a truly unifying theory has yet to emerge, I suggest that the enduring theoretical features and formalized frameworks highlighted in this article could form a groundwork for future unifying theories of psychedelic drug effects.},

	abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays important functions in cell survival and differentiation, neuronal outgrowth and plasticity. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), BDNF signaling is known to be impaired, partially because amyloid β (Aβ) induces truncation of BDNF main receptor, TrkB-full length (TrkB-FL). We have previously shown that such truncation is mediated by calpains, results in the formation of an intracellular domain (ICD) fragment and causes BDNF loss of function. Since calpains are Ca2+-dependent proteases, we hypothesized that excessive intracellular Ca2+ build-up could be due to dysfunctional N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) activation. To experimentally address this hypothesis, we investigated whether TrkB-FL truncation by calpains and consequent BDNF loss of function could be prevented by NMDAR blockade. We herein demonstrate that a NMDAR antagonist, memantine, prevented excessive calpain activation and TrkB-FL truncation induced by Aβ25-35. When calpains were inhibited by calpastatin, BDNF was able to increase the dendritic spine density of neurons exposed to Aβ25-35. Moreover, NMDAR inhibition by memantine also prevented Aβ-driven deleterious impact of BDNF loss of function on structural (spine density) and functional outcomes (synaptic potentiation). Collectively, these findings support NMDAR/Ca2+/calpains mechanistic involvement in Aβ-triggered BDNF signaling disruption.},

	abstract = {The N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine has attracted enormous interest in mental health research owing to its rapid antidepressant actions, but its mechanism of action has remained elusive. Here we show that blockade of NMDAR-dependent bursting activity in the ‘anti-reward center’, the lateral habenula (LHb), mediates the rapid antidepressant actions of ketamine in rat and mouse models of depression. LHb neurons show a significant increase in burst activity and theta-band synchronization in depressive-like animals, which is reversed by ketamine. Burst-evoking photostimulation of LHb drives behavioural despair and anhedonia. Pharmacology and modelling experiments reveal that LHb bursting requires both NMDARs and low-voltage-sensitive T-type calcium channels (T-VSCCs). Furthermore, local blockade of NMDAR or T-VSCCs in the LHb is sufficient to induce rapid antidepressant effects. Our results suggest a simple model whereby ketamine quickly elevates mood by blocking NMDAR-dependent bursting activity of LHb neurons to disinhibit downstream monoaminergic reward centres, and provide a framework for developing new rapid-acting antidepressants.},

Emerging evidence has revealed that there is an enrichment of cells that express the estrogen receptor in the lateral habenula (LHb) region, however, the precise biological functions of estradiol on neurons in the LHb remain to be elucidated. The present study aimed to determine the effects of estradiol on LHb neurons, by observing neuronal firing activity, and c‑Fos mRNA and protein expression levels in the LHb using whole cell recording, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Ovariectomized female Wistar rats were supplemented with a range of estradiol doses across five groups: Ovariectomized (no treatment); Oil (sesame oil); low estradiol; medial estradiol (ME) and high estradiol. Circulating serum estradiol levels were assessed over a 33 day period following surgery. Estradiol suppressed spontaneous firing activity in LHb neurons (P{\textless}0.05, compared with firing rates prior to estradiol treatment), which suggested a role for this hormone in regulating neuronal activity. Estradiol replacement therapy resulted in sustained serum estradiol levels for {\textasciitilde}3 weeks after surgery. The mRNA and protein levels of c‑Fos were significantly downregulated in LHb tissues from ME rats as compared with Oil animals (P{\textless}0.05). In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that estradiol suppresses neuronal activities in the LHb region, suggesting that the LHb may be a potential target for estradiol action.},

	abstract = {Human brain is structurally and functionally asymmetrical and the asymmetries of brain phenotypes have been shown to change in normal aging. Recent advances in graph theoretical analysis have showed topological lateralization between hemispheric networks in the human brain throughout the lifespan. Nevertheless, apparent discrepancies of hemispheric asymmetry were reported between the structural and functional brain networks, indicating the potentially complex asymmetry pattern between structural and functional networks in aging population. In this study, using multimodal neuroimaging, we investigated the characteristics of hemispheric network topology in seventy-six (male/female = 15/61) community-dwelling older adults. Multimodal neuroimaging data, including resting-state fMRI and structural diffusion tensor imaging were recorded from 78 older adults. Hemispheric functional and structural brain networks were obtained for each participant. Graph theoretical approaches were then employed to estimate the hemispheric topological properties. We found that the optimal small-world properties were preserved in both structural and functional hemispheric networks in older adults. Moreover, a leftward asymmetry in both global and local levels were observed in structural brain networks in comparison with a symmetric pattern in functional brain network, suggesting a dissociable process of hemispheric asymmetry between structural and functional connectome in healthy older adults. Finally, the scores of hemispheric asymmetry in both structural and functional networks were associated with behavioral performance in various cognitive domains. Taken together, these findings provided new insights into the lateralized nature of multimodal brain connectivity, highlighted the potentially complex relationship between structural and functional brain network alterations, and augmented our understanding of asymmetric structural and functional specializations in normal aging.},

To assess effects of chronic opiates on the major site of postsynaptic GABAergic activity, the GABAA receptor, we administered chronic morphine and naltrexone to mice and evaluated binding at the benzodiazepine andt-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) sites and GABA-dependent chloride uptake. After morphine (3 days), benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo but not in vitro was increased in cortex compared to placebo-treated mice. TBPS binding was unchanged in cortex, but muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake was increased at low doses of muscimol. Benzodiazepine and TBPS binding and muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake were unchanged in naltrexone-(8 days) compared to placebo-treated mice. When naltrexone was administered previously to block opiate sites, the increases in benzodiazepine binding and chloride uptake observed with chronic morphine were reversed. These results indicate that chronic morphine but not naltrexone enhances benzodiazepine binding and GABAA receptor function, perhaps by an action at opioid receptors.},

	abstract = {Linalool is a monoterpene compound commonly found as a major component of the essential oils of several aromatic plant species, many of which are used in traditional medical systems as analgesic and anti-inflammatory remedies. We previously reported that (-)-linalool, the natural occurring enantiomer, plays a major role in the anti-inflammatory activity displayed by different essential oils, suggesting that linalool-producing species are potentially anti-inflammatory agents. In this study, the antinociceptive activity of (-)-linalool was examined in two different pain models in mice: the acetic acid-induced writhing response, a model of inflammatory pain, and the hot plate test, a model of supraspinal analgesia. Moreover, the effect of (-)-linalool on spontaneous locomotor activity (25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg) was evaluated. The results show that this compound induced a significant reduction of the acid-induced writhing at doses ranging from 25 to 75 mg/kg. Such effect was completely reversed both by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone and by the unselective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine. In the hot plate test, only the dose of 100 mg/kg of (-)-linalool resulted in a significant effect. (-)-Linalool induced a dose dependent increase of motility effects, thus ruling out the confounding influence of a possible sedative effect. The more pronounced effect of (-)-linalool on the writhing test with respect to the hot plate test is consistent with the observation that (-)-linalool possesses anti-inflammatory activity. Finally, the activation of opioidergic and cholinergic systems appears to play a crucial role in (-)-linalool-induced antinociception.},

	abstract = {Linalool and linalyl acetate are the principal components of many essential oils known to possess several biological activities, attributable to these monoterpene compounds. In this work, we evaluated individually the anti-inflammatory properties of (-) linalool, that is, the natural occurring enantiomer, and its racemate form, present in various amounts in distilled or extracted essential oils. Because in the linalool-containing essential oils, linalyl acetate, is frequently present, we also examined the anti-inflammatory action of this monoterpene ester. Carrageenin-induced edema in rats was used as a model of inflammation. The experimental data indicate that both the pure enantiomer and its racemate induced, after systemic administration, a reduction of edema. Moreover, the pure enantiomer, at a dose of 25 mg/kg, elicited a delayed and more prolonged effect, while the racemate form induced a significant reduction of the edema only one hour after carrageenin administration. At higher doses, no differences were observed between the (-) enantiomer and the racemate; a further increase in the dose of both forms did not result in an increased effect at any time of observation. The effects of equi-molar doses of linalyl acetate on local edema were less relevant and more delayed than that of the corresponding alcohol. These finding suggest a typical pro-drug behavior of linalyl acetate. The results obtained indicate that linalool and the corresponding acetate play a major role in the anti-inflammatory activity displayed by the essential oils containing them, and provide further evidence suggesting that linalool and linalyl acetate-producing species are potentially anti-inflammatory agents.},

	abstract = {Hypofunction of the serotonergic (5-HT) system has close relationship with the symptoms in major depressive disorders (MDD), however, the underlying neural circuitry mechanisms are not fully understood. Lateral habenula (LHb) plays a crucial role in aversive behaviors and is activated in conditions of depression. It has been reported that 5-HT inhibits the excitability of LHb neurons, leading to the hypothesis that decreased transmission of 5-HT would elevate the activity of LHb and therefore mediates depressive symptoms. Using retrograde tract tracing with cholera toxin subunit B, we find that dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) sends primary 5-HT projection to the LHb. In vitro slice patch-clamp recording reveals that opto-stimulation of DRN inputs to the LHb suppresses the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current, while increases paired pulse ratio in LHb neurons, indicating 5-HT projection presynaptically suppresses the excitability of LHb neurons. In chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model of depression, optogenetic stimulation of DRN–LHb projection alleviates the depressive symptoms in CUMS models. Meanwhile, opto-inhibition of this circuit results in elevated c-fos expression in LHb and induces depression-like behaviors. This study demonstrates that the 5-HT projection from DRN to LHb suppresses the excitability of LHb neurons, and hypofunction of 5-HT transmission induces depressive behavior via the activation of LHb. Our results reveal the functional connectivity of DRN–LHb circuit and its antidepressant action, which may provide a novel target for the treatment of depression.},

Here, using a high-throughput quantitative proteomic screen, we show that an astroglial potassium channel (Kir4.1) is upregulated in the LHb in rat models of depression. Kir4.1 in the LHb shows a distinct pattern of expression on astrocytic membrane processes that wrap tightly around the neuronal soma. Electrophysiology and modelling data show that the level of Kir4.1 on astrocytes tightly regulates the degree of membrane hyperpolarization and the amount of bursting activity of LHb neurons. Astrocyte-specific gain and loss of Kir4.1 in the LHb bidirectionally regulates neuronal bursting and depression-like symptoms. Together, these results show that a gliaâ€“neuron interaction at the perisomatic space of LHb is involved in setting the neuronal firing mode in models of a major psychiatric disease. Kir4.1 in the LHb might have potential as a target for treating clinical depression.},

	abstract = {Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons and their forebrain projections are critically involved in reward processing and cognitive functions. Descending projections from the lateral habenula (LHb) play a central role in inhibiting DA cell activity in response to the absence of expected rewards. As LHb efferents are reportedly glutamatergic, their ability to inhibit DA cells would theoretically require a disynaptic connection involving VTA GABA neurons and their local collateral inputs to DA cells. We therefore used anterograde tract-tracing from the LHb to investigate the relative selectivity of LHb synapses onto GABA versus DA VTA neurons. LHb axons were visualized using immunoperoxidase, and DA and GABA cells were marked by immunogold-silver labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or GABA, respectively. By ultrastructural analysis, 16\% of LHb axons were observed to form synaptic contacts in the VTA, and most of these were of an intermediate morphological type that did not exhibit definitive asymmetric or symmetric character. LHb axons synaptically targeted TH- and GABA-labeled dendrites to a comparable extent (45 and 52\% observed incidence, respectively). Pre-embedding immunogold labeling for the vesicular glutamate transporter type 2 and post-embedding immunogold staining for GABA confirmed that approximately 85\% of LHb terminals were glutamatergic and not GABAergic. These results suggest that the robust inhibition of DA cells evoked by the LHb is unlikely to arise from a selective innervation of VTA GABA neurons. Moreover, the LHb may mediate a direct excitation of DA cells that is over-ridden by indirect inhibition originating from an extrinsic source.},

Antioxidants, like vitamin E, have been used in the treatment of TD but there is no evidence of their effectiveness. Melatonin (MEL) is 6 to 10 times more effective, as an antioxidant, than vitamin E and it has been used with an apparent higher effectiveness in the treatment of TD, although the results have not been conclusive. A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled design was used to determine the effectiveness of MEL (20 mg/day) during 12 weeks in 7 patients with TD. Six patients with TD were treated with placebo. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) was chosen to assess the severity of TD initially and after 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The psychiatric evaluation was done following the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. In two patients treated with MEL a significant improvement (more than 60\%) of the values of AIMS was detected. In the remainder five, as well as in the patients treated with placebo, no difference was observed during the 12 weeks. When compared the AIMS score in all the MEL-treated patients with the values in the placebo-treated patients, no significant differences were detected during the 12 weeks of the study.

Medline-based search on melatonin-dopamine interactions in mammals. Melatonin. the hormone produced by the pineal gland at night. influences circadian and seasonal rhythms, most notably the sleep-wake cycle and seasonal reproduction. The neurochemical basis of these activities is not understood yet. Inhibition of dopamine release by melatonin has been demonstrated in specific areas of the mammalian central nervous system (hypothalamus, hippocampus, medulla-pons, and retina). Antidopaminergic activities of melatonin have been demonstrated in the striatum. Dopaminergic transmission has a pivotal role in circadian entrainment of the fetus, in coordination of body movement and reproduction. Recent findings indicate that melatonin may modulate dopaminergic pathways involved in movement disorders in humans. In Parkinson patients melatonin may, on the one hand, exacerbate symptoms (because of its putative interference with dopamine release) and, on the other, protect against neurodegeneration (by virtue of its antioxidant properties and its effects on mitochondrial activity). Melatonin appears to be effective in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. a severe movement disorder associated with long-term blockade of the postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptor by antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenic patients. The interaction of melatonin with the dopaminergic system may play a significant role in the nonphotic and photic entrainment of the biological clock as well as in the fine-tuning of motor coordination in the striatum. These interactions and the antioxidant nature of melatonin may be beneficial in the treatment of dopamine-related disorders.},

Knockdown of p11 expression in LHb alleviates the stress-induced depression-like behaviors. Moreover, chronic restraint stress induces bursting action potentials in LHb neurons, which are abolished by p11 knockdown. Overexpression of p11 in dopamine D2 receptor-containing LHb neurons of control mice induces depression-like behaviors.

	abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the impact of therapeutic oral doses of stimulants on the brains of ADHD subjects as measured by MRI-based neuroimaging studies (morphometric, functional, spectroscopy).

Data Sources
We searched PubMed and ScienceDirect through the end of calendar year 2011 using the keywords: 1) “psychostimulants” or “methylphenidate” or “amphetamine”, and 2) “neuroimaging” or “MRI” or “fMRI”, and 3) “ADHD” or “ADD” or “Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder” or “Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder”.

Study Selection
We included only English language articles with new data that were case or placebo-controlled and examined ADHD subjects on and off psychostimulants (as well as 5 relevant review papers).

Data Extraction
We combined details of study design and medication effects in each imaging modality.

Results
We found 29 published studies that met our criteria. These included 6 structural MRI, 20 functional MRI studies and 3 spectroscopy studies. Methods varied widely in terms of design, analytic technique, and regions of the brain investigated. Despite heterogeneity in methods, however, results were consistent. With only a few exceptions, the data on the effect of therapeutic oral doses of stimulant medication suggest attenuation of structural and functional alterations found in unmedicated ADHD subjects relative to findings in Controls.

Conclusions
Despite the inherent limitations and heterogeneity of the extant MRI literature, our review suggests that therapeutic oral doses of stimulants decrease alterations in brain structure and function in subjects with ADHD relative to unmedicated subjects and Controls. These medication-associated brain effects parallel, and may underlie, the well-established clinical benefits.},

	abstract = {Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a common neuro-behavioural disorder characterized by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, is a chronic disorder and often persists into adulthood. CNS stimulants have been the most well known treatment for ADHD for several decades due to their high effectiveness, good safety profiles and relatively minor adverse effects. Non-stimulant agents, including atomoxetine, extended-release guanfacine and extended-release clonidine (US FDA approved), and several non-FDA-approved agents, such as bupropion and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), were recently proven to be effective alternatives to the stimulants in several open-label and placebo-controlled trials. However, most medication trials for ADHD have been short term and thus have not provided information on the long-term outcomes of ADHD treatment. Since the medical treatment of many children with ADHD, especially those with more severe symptoms or co-morbid disorders, has to be continued for several years, recent studies have shifted their focus from the acute effectiveness of stimulants or non-stimulant drugs to the long-term outcomes of medications for ADHD. Evidence has shown that stimulants, along with the non-stimulants atomoxetine and extended-release guanfacine, are continuously effective for 24-month treatment periods with few and tolerable adverse effects.},

    at concentrations ≥10μM evoked dose-dependent currents in the absence of GABA. These currents were potentiated by diazepam (1μM) and blocked by bicuculline (10μM). The MFA (50μM) current-voltage relationship and reversal potential were similar to that evoked by GABA. MFA (1–100μM) had no effects on sub-maximal glycine, glutamate or NMDA evoked currents.

We combined transplantation of single haematopoietic stem cells with whole-genome sequencing to show that this damage occurs in stem cells, leading to deletions and rearrangements that are indicative of microhomology-mediated end-joining repair. Moreover, deletion of p53 completely rescues the survival of aldehyde-stressed and mutated haematopoietic stem cells, but does not change the pattern or the intensity of genome instability within individual stem cells. These findings characterize the mutation of the stem-cell genome by an alcohol-derived and endogenous source of DNA damage. Furthermore, we identify how the choice of DNA-repair pathway and a stringent p53 response limit the transmission of aldehyde-induced mutations in stem cells.},

The association between cannabis use and the risk of psychosis has been studied extensively but the temporal order still remains controversial.


Aims
To examine the association between cannabis use in adolescence and the risk of psychosis after adjustment for prodromal symptoms and other potential confounders.


Method
The sample (n = 6534) was composed of the prospective general population-based Northern Finland Birth Cohort of 1986. Information on prodromal symptoms of psychosis and cannabis use was collected using questionnaires at age 15–16 years. Participants were followed up for ICD-10 psychotic disorders until age 30 years using nationwide registers.


Results
The risk of psychosis was elevated in individuals who had tried cannabis five times or more (hazard ratio, (HR) = 6.5, 95\% CI 3.0–13.9). The association remained statistically significant even when adjusted for prodromal symptoms, other substance use and parental psychosis (HR = 3.0, 95\% CI 1.1–8.0).


Conclusions
Adolescent cannabis use is associated with increased risk of psychosis even after adjustment for baseline prodromal symptoms, parental psychosis and other substance use.

Viral infection resulted in a strong, localized transgene expression after 2â€“4 days which diminished after one week. Anxiety-like behavior and the anxiolytic effect of diazepam were assessed three days after gene delivery using the elevated plus maze test. While SHPE infection alone did not reduce anxiety-like behavior, rats infected with SHPE exhibited a greater response to the anxiolytic effect of diazepam when compared to rats infected with a control virus (SHZ.1) containing the lacZ gene. The enhancement of diazepam action by SHPE was naloxone reversible, region-specific, and correlated with the time course of preproenkephalin expression. The findings implicate amygdalar opioid peptides in regulating the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines. This study also demonstrates the usefulness of recombinant herpes virus in evaluating the role of single gene products within specific brain sites in pharmacological responses and complex behaviors.},

	issn = {0176-3679},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute dissociative states are common in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, there are no established pharmacotherapeutic treatment options for this severe clinical condition.
METHODS: The effect of 0.4 mg naloxone administered intravenously in acute dissociative states was examined as compared to placebo in a double-blind crossover study in nine patients who met DSM-IV-criteria for BPD. Dissociative symptoms before and 15 min after a single dose of naloxone or saline placebo were assessed using a self-rating instrument for dissociation and aversive inner tension (DSS) and the observer-based items of the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS).
RESULTS: Dissociative symptoms before treatment with naloxone or saline placebo were moderate to severe. After injection of either naloxone or placebo, dissociative symptoms significantly decreased on the DSS (p {\textless} 0.01) and the CADSS (p {\textless} 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between naloxone and placebo in the reduction of symptoms. Patients who showed the most prominent response to naloxone fulfilled the highest number of DSM-IV-criteria for BPD.
CONCLUSIONS: Although it is difficult to draw definite conclusions from this small sample of patients, this study does not support the assumption that naloxone in a single dose of 0.4 mg is superior to placebo in acute dissociative states in patients with BPD. Further studies will investigate whether patients benefit from naloxone in a higher dose or whether subgroups of patients with BPD profit from naloxone in acute dissociative states.},

	abstract = {The role of opioid systems in the anticonflict effect of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and pentobarbital was evaluated with a modified Vogel procedure. First, morphine, ineffective by itself, was combined with subeffective or marginally effective doses of the benzodiazepines in order to detect possible potentiation. However, the combined treatment reduced licking in the Vogel procedure as well as in a licking test where no shock was administered. Several doses of the benzodiazepines and pentobarbital were then administered in combination with several doses of the opiate antagonist naloxone. A dose-dependent inhibition of anticonflict effect was obtained. In an additional experiment, it was shown that naloxone blocked the effects of diazepam in the elevated plus-maze procedure. Motor deficiencies, as evaluated with a rotarod test, produced by the benzodiazepines and pentobarbital could not be antagonized by naloxone. It is concluded that opioids are important for the anticonflict but not for the motor effects of these drugs. An analysis of published studies concerning the interaction of opioids and benzodiazepines in several procedures supposed to reflect anxiolytic effects shows that the inhibition obtained with naloxone is reliable and not procedure specific. The mechanisms by which opiate antagonists produce this inhibition of anticonflict activity are not known. It is tentatively suggested that opioid activation associated with stress may be a necessary component of anxiolysis.},

	abstract = {The phantom sound of tinnitus is believed to be triggered by aberrant neural activity in the central auditory pathway, but since this debilitating condition is often associated with emotional distress and anxiety, these comorbidities likely arise from maladaptive functional connections to limbic structures such as the amygdala and hippocampus. To test this hypothesis, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to identify aberrant effective connectivity of the amygdala and hippocampus in tinnitus patients and to determine the relationship with tinnitus characteristics. Chronic tinnitus patients (n = 26) and age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (n = 23) were included. Both groups were comparable for hearing level. Granger causality analysis utilizing the amygdala and hippocampus as seed regions were used to investigate the directional connectivity and the relationship with tinnitus duration or distress. Relative to healthy controls, tinnitus patients demonstrated abnormal directional connectivity of the amygdala and hippocampus, including primary and association auditory cortex, and other non-auditory areas. Importantly, scores on the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaires were positively correlated with increased connectivity from the left amygdala to left superior temporal gyrus (r = 0.570, P = 0.005), and from the right amygdala to right superior temporal gyrus (r = 0.487, P = 0.018). Moreover, enhanced effective connectivity from the right hippocampus to left transverse temporal gyrus was correlated with tinnitus duration (r = 0.452, P = 0.030). The results showed that tinnitus distress strongly correlates with enhanced effective connectivity that is directed from the amygdala to the auditory cortex. The longer the phantom sensation, the more likely acute tinnitus becomes permanently encoded by memory traces in the hippocampus. Hum Brain Mapp 38:2384–2397, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Cannabis affects cognitive performance through the activation of the endocannabinoid system, and the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are poorly understood. Using the novel object-recognition memory test in mice, we found that the main psychoactive component of cannabis, delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), alters short-term object-recognition memory specifically involving protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent signaling. Indeed, the systemic or intra-hippocampal pre-treatment with the PKC inhibitors prevented the short-term, but not the long-term, memory impairment induced by THC. In contrast, systemic pre-treatment with mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibitors, known to block the amnesic-like effects of THC on long-term memory, did not modify such a short-term cognitive deficit. Immunoblot analysis revealed a transient increase in PKC signaling activity in the hippocampus after THC treatment. Thus, THC administration induced the phosphorylation of a specific Ser residue in the hydrophobic-motif at the C-terminal tail of several PKC isoforms. This significant immunoreactive band that paralleled cognitive performance did not match in size with the major PKC isoforms expressed in the hippocampus except for PKCθ. Moreover, THC transiently enhanced the phosphorylation of the postsynaptic calmodulin-binding protein neurogranin in a PKC dependent manner. These data demonstrate that THC alters short-term object-recognition memory through hippocampal PKC/neurogranin signaling.},

	abstract = {Classical psychedelics are psychoactive substances, which, besides their psychopharmacological activity, have also been shown to exert significant modulatory effects on immune responses by altering signaling pathways involved in inflammation, cellular proliferation and cell survival via activating NF-ÎºB and MAPKs. Recently, several neurotransmitter receptors involved in the pharmacology of psychedelics, such as serotonin and sigma-1 receptors, have also been shown to play crucial roles in numerous immunological processes. This emerging field also offers promising treatment modalities in the therapy of various diseases including autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions, infections, and cancer. However, the scarcity of available review literature renders the topic unclear and obscure, mostly posing psychedelics as illicit drugs of abuse and not as physiologically relevant molecules or as possible agents of future pharmacotherapies. In this paper, the immunomodulatory potential of classical serotonergic psychedelics, including N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) will be discussed from a perspective of molecular immunology and pharmacology. Special attention will be given to the functional interaction of serotonin and sigma-1 receptors and their cross-talk with Toll-like and RIG-I-like pattern recognition receptor-mediated signaling. Furthermore, novel approaches will be suggested feasible for the treatment of diseases with chronic inflammatory etiology and pathology, such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, depression and Alzheimer's disease.},

They rapidly block serotonin (5-HT) reuptake, yet the onset of their therapeutic action requires weeks of treatment. This delay is the result of presynaptic and postsynaptic adaptive mechanisms secondary to reuptake inhibition. The prevention of a negative feedback mechanism operating at the 5-HT autoreceptor level enhances the neurochemical and clinical effects of SSRIs. The blockade of 5-HT2A receptors also seems to improve the clinical effects of SSRIs. These receptors are located postsynaptically to 5-HT axons, mainly in the neocortex. Pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex are particularly enriched in 5-HT2A receptors. Their blockade may affect the function of prefrontal–subcortical circuits, an effect that probably underlies the beneficial effects of the addition of atypical antipsychotic drugs, which are 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, to SSRIs in treatment-resistant patients.},

Recent research has established that environmental events and behavioral experience induce epigenetic changes at particular gene loci that help shape neuronal plasticity and function, and hence behavior, and that some of these changes can be very stable and even persist for a lifetime. Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that aberrations in chromatin remodeling and subsequent effects on gene expression within limbic brain regions contribute to the pathogenesis of depression and other stress-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety syndromes. Likewise, the gradually developing but persistent therapeutic effects of antidepressant medications may be achieved in part via epigenetic mechanisms. This review discusses recent advances in understanding epigenetic regulation of stress-related disorders and focuses on three distinct aspects of stress-induced epigenetic pathology: the effects of stress and antidepressant treatment during adulthood, the life-long effects of early life stress on subsequent stress vulnerability, and the possible trans-generational transmission of stress-induced abnormalities.},

	abstract = {Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are among the most widely prescribed drugs in psychiatry. Based on the fact that SSRIs increase extracellular monoamine levels in the brain, the monoamine hypothesis of depression was introduced, postulating that depression is associated with too low serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline levels. However, several lines of evidence indicate that this hypothesis is too simplistic and that depression and the efficacy of SSRIs are dependent on neuroplastic changes mediated by changes in gene expression. Because a coherent view on global gene expression is lacking, we aim to provide an overview of the effects of SSRI treatment on the final targets of 5-HT receptor signal transduction pathways, namely the transcriptional regulation of genes. We address gene polymorphisms in humans that affect SSRI efficacy, as well as in vitro studies employing human-derived cells. We also discuss the molecular targets affected by SSRIs in animal models, both in vivo and in vitro. We conclude that serotonin transporter gene variation in humans affects the efficacy and side-effects of SSRIs, whereas SSRIs generally do not affect serotonin transporter gene expression in animals. Instead, SSRIs alter mRNA levels of genes encoding serotonin receptors, components of non-serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, neurotrophic factors, hypothalamic hormones and inflammatory factors. So far little is known about the epigenetic and age-dependent molecular effects of SSRIs, which might give more insights in the working mechanism(s) of SSRIs.},

	abstract = {Background
The amygdala is a key structure in serotonergic emotion-processing circuits. In healthy volunteers, acute administration of the serotonin 1A/2A/2C receptor agonist psilocybin reduces neural responses to negative stimuli and induces mood changes toward positive states. However, it is little-known whether psilocybin reduces amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli and whether any change in amygdala reactivity is related to mood change.
Methods
This study assessed the effects of acute administration of the hallucinogen psilocybin (.16 mg/kg) versus placebo on amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli in 25 healthy volunteers using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Mood changes were assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A double-blind, randomized, cross-over design was used with volunteers counterbalanced to receive psilocybin and placebo in two separate sessions at least 14 days apart.
Results
Amygdala reactivity to negative and neutral stimuli was lower after psilocybin administration than after placebo administration. The psilocybin-induced attenuation of right amygdala reactivity in response to negative stimuli was related to the psilocybin-induced increase in positive mood state.
Conclusions
These results demonstrate that acute treatment with psilocybin decreased amygdala reactivity during emotion processing and that this was associated with an increase of positive mood in healthy volunteers. These findings may be relevant to the normalization of amygdala hyperactivity and negative mood states in patients with major depression.},

New classifications now distinguish narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency (also called type 1 narcolepsy), a lifelong disorder with well-established diagnostic procedures and etiology, from other syndromes with hypersomnolence of unknown causes. Klein-Levin Syndrome, a periodic hypersomnia associated with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities, is also considered a separate entity with separate therapeutic protocols. Non hypocretin-related hypersomnia syndromes are diagnoses of exclusion. These diagnoses are only made after eliminating sleep deprivation, sleep apnea, disturbed nocturnal sleep, and psychiatric comorbidities as the primary cause of daytime sleepiness. The treatment of narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency is well-codified, and involves pharmacotherapies using sodium oxybate, stimulants, and/or antidepressants, plus behavioral modifications. These therapies are almost always needed, and the risk-to-benefit ratio is clear, notably in children. Detailed knowledge of the pharmacological profile of each compound is needed to optimize use. Treatment for other syndromes with hypersomnolence is more challenging and less codified. Preferably, therapy should be conservative (such as modafinil, atomoxetine, behavioral modifications), but it may have to be more aggressive (high-dose stimulants, sodium oxybate, etc.) on a case-by-case, empirical trial basis. As cause and evolution are unknown in these conditions, it is important to challenge diagnosis and therapy over time, keeping in mind the possibility of tolerance and the development of stimulant addiction. Kleine-Levin Syndrome is usually best left untreated, although lithium can be considered in severe cases with frequent episodes.

Many METH abusers smoke cigarettes and thus self-administer nicotine; yet few studies have investigated the effects of nicotine on METH-induced dopaminergic deficits. This interaction is of interest because preclinical studies demonstrate that nicotine can be neuroprotective, perhaps owing to effects involving α4β2 and α6β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This study revealed that oral nicotine exposure beginning in adolescence [postnatal day (PND) 40] through adulthood [PND 96] attenuated METH-induced striatal dopaminergic deficits when METH was administered at PND 89. This protection did not appear to be due to nicotine-induced alterations in METH pharmacokinetics. Short-term (i.e., 21-day) high-dose nicotine exposure also protected when administered from PND 40 to PND 61 (with METH at PND 54), but this protective effect did not persist. Short-term (i.e., 21-day) high-dose nicotine exposure did not protect when administered postadolescence (i.e., beginning at PND 61, with METH at PND 75). However, protection was engendered if the duration of nicotine exposure was extended to 39 days (with METH at PND 93). Autoradiographic analysis revealed that nicotine increased striatal α4β2 expression, as assessed using [125I]epibatidine. Both METH and nicotine decreased striatal α6β2 expression, as assessed using [125I]α-conotoxin MII. These findings indicate that nicotine protects against METH-induced striatal dopaminergic deficits, perhaps by affecting α4β2 and/or α6β2 expression, and that both age of onset and duration of nicotine exposure affect this protection.},

Addiction to psychostimulant methamphetamine (METH) remains a major public health problem in the world. Animal models that use METH self-administration incorporate many features of human drug-taking behavior and are very helpful in elucidating mechanisms underlying METH addiction. These models are also helping to decipher the neurobiological substrates of associated neuropsychiatric complications. This review summarizes our work on the influence of METH self-administration on dopamine systems, transcriptional and immune responses in the brain.

Methods
We used the rat model of METH self-administration with extended access (15 hours/day for 8 consecutive days) to investigate the effects of voluntary METH intake on the markers of dopamine system integrity and changes in gene expression observed in the brain at 2 hours â€“ 1 month after cessation of drug exposure.

Results
Extended access to METH self-administration caused changes in the rat brain that are consistent with clinical findings reported in neuroimaging and post-mortem studies of human METH addicts. In addition, gene expression studies using striatal tissues from METH self-administering rats revealed increased expression of genes involved in CREB signaling pathway and in the activation of neuroinflammatory response in the brain.

Conclusion
These data show an association of METH exposure with activation of neuroplastic and neuroinflammatory cascades in the brain. The neuroplastic changes may be involved in promoting METH addiction. Neuroinflammatory processes in the striatum may underlie cognitive deficits, depression, and parkinsonism reported in METH addicts. Therapeutic approaches that include suppression of neuroinflammation may be beneficial to addicted patients.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Schizophrenia is associated with prenatal inflammation and/or postnatal stressors such as drug abuse, resulting in immune-redox dysfunction. Antioxidants may offer therapeutic benefits.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to investigate N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) as a therapeutic antioxidant to reverse schizophrenia-like bio-behavioural changes in rats exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), adolescent methamphetamine (MA) or a combination thereof.
METHODS: Sprague-Dawley offspring prenatally exposed to saline/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) received saline or MA (0.2-6 mg kg-1 twice daily × 16 days) during adolescence and divided into LPS, MA and LPS + MA groups. Vehicle/NAC (150 mg kg-1 × 14 days) was administered following MA/saline exposure on postnatal day 51-64. Social interaction, novel object recognition and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle, as well as regional brain monoamines, lipid peroxidation, plasma reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α; IL-10), were assessed.
RESULTS: NAC reversed LPS, MA and LPS + MA-induced anxiety-like social withdrawal behaviours, as well as MA and LPS + MA-induced deficits in recognition memory. PPI deficits were evident in MA, LPS and LPS + MA models, with NAC reversing that following LPS + MA. NAC reversed LPS, MA and LPS + MA-induced frontal cortical dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) elevations, LPS and LPS + MA-induced frontal cortical 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), serotonin (5-HT) and striatal NA deficits as well as LPS + MA-induced frontal cortical 5-HT turnover. Decreased IL-10 in the LPS, MA and LPS + MA animals, and increased TNF-α in the LPS and MA animals, was reversed with NAC. NAC also reversed elevated lipid peroxidation and ROS in the LPS and LPS + MA animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal LPS, LPS + postnatal MA challenge during adolescence, and to a lesser extent MA alone, promotes schizophrenia-like bio-behavioural changes later in life that are reversed by NAC, emphasizing therapeutic potential for schizophrenia and MA-associated psychosis. The nature and timing of the dual-hit are critical.},

	abstract = {Endogenous opioids have complex social effects that may depend on specific receptor actions and vary depending on the “stage” of social behavior (e.g., seeking vs. responding to social stimuli). We tested the effects of a nonspecific opioid antagonist, naltrexone (NTX), on social processing in humans. NTX is used to treat alcohol and opiate dependence, and may affect both mu and kappa-opioid systems. We assessed attention (“seeking”), and subjective and psycho-physiological responses (“responding”) to positive and negative social stimuli. Based on literature suggesting mu-opioid blockade impairs positive social responses, we hypothesized that NTX would decrease responses to positive social stimuli. We also tested responses to negative stimuli, which might be either increased by NTX’s mu-opioid effects or decreased by its kappa-opioid effects. Thirty-four healthy volunteers received placebo, 25 mg, or 50 mg NTX across three sessions under double-blind conditions. At each session, participants completed measures of attention, identification, and emotional responses for emotional faces and scenes. NTX increased attention to emotional expressions, slowed identification of sadness and fear, and decreased ratings of arousal for social and nonsocial emotional scenes. These findings are more consistent with anxiolytic kappa-antagonist than mu-blocking effects, suggesting effects on kappa receptors may contribute to the clinical effects of NTX.},

The current study was designed to investigate CS for potential effectiveness to attenuate cisplatin-induced vomiting in healthy pigeons and to study the impact on neurotransmitters involved centrally and peripherally in the act of vomiting. High Performance Liquid Chromatography system coupled with electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD) was used for the quantification of neurotransmitters 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT), dopamine (DA) and their metabolites; Di-hydroxy Phenyl Acetic acid (Dopac), Homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5HIAA) centrally in specific brain areas (area postrema and brain stem) while, peripherally in small intestine. Cisplatin (7 mg/kg i.v.) induce emesis without lethality across the 24 hr observation period. CS hexane fraction (CS-HexFr; 10 mg/kg) attenuated cisplatin induced emesis {\textasciitilde} 65.85 \% (P {\textless} 0.05); the reference anti-emetic drug, metoclopramide (MCP; 30 mg/kg), produced {\textasciitilde} 43.90 \% reduction (P {\textless} 0.05). At acute time point (3rd h), CS-HexFr decreased (P {\textless} 0.001) the concentration of 5HT and 5HIAA in the area postrema, brain stem and intestine, while at 18th h (delayed time point) CS-HexFr attenuated (P {\textless} 0.001) the upsurge of 5HT caused by cisplatin in the brain stem and intestine and dopamine in the area postrema. CS-HexFr treatment alone did not alter the basal neurotransmitters and their metabolites in the brain areas and intestine except 5HIAA and HVA, which were decreased significantly. In conclusion the anti-emetic effect of CS-HexFr is mediated by anti-serotonergic and anti-dopaminergic components in a blended manner at the two different time points i.e 3rd hr and 18th hr in pigeons.},

Here, we screened more than 1,000 marketed drugs against 40 representative gut bacterial strains, and found that 24\% of the drugs with human targets, including members of all therapeutic classes, inhibited the growth of at least one strain in vitro. Particular classes, such as the chemically diverse antipsychotics, were overrepresented in this group. The effects of human-targeted drugs on gut bacteria are reflected on their antibiotic-like side effects in humans and are concordant with existing human cohort studies. Susceptibility to antibiotics and human-targeted drugs correlates across bacterial species, suggesting common resistance mechanisms, which we verified for some drugs. The potential risk of non-antibiotics promoting antibiotic resistance warrants further exploration. Our results provide a resource for future research on drugâ€“microbiome interactions, opening new paths for side effect control and drug repurposing, and broadening our view of antibiotic resistance.},

Administration of CART (54–102) into the lateral ventricle (50 and 100 ng) and bilaterally in the CeA (10 and 20 ng) caused a significant reduction in social interaction, suggesting an anxiogenic action of the peptide. Chronic ethanol treatment for 15 days followed by withdrawal precipitated an anxiogenic response at 24 h that was attenuated by intracerebroventricular (5 μl) and intra-CeA (1 μl) administration of antibodies against CART (1 : 500 dilution). An immunocytochemistry protocol was employed to study the response of the endogenous CART system in the CeA following chronic ethanol withdrawal. At 0 h ethanol withdrawal, CART immunoreactivity was apparent in few fibers and the profile was similar to that in the pair-fed control rats. Twenty-four hours following ethanol withdrawal, a highly significant increase (P{\textless}0.001) in CART immunoreactivity was noticed in the CeA, which returned to normal 48 and 72 h post-withdrawal. Similar doses of CART or CART antibody injected bilaterally into the BNSTl or AcbSh produced no response in the social interaction test. Furthermore, the CART immunoreactivity profile did not change at the post-withdrawal time points in each of these brain sites. We suggest that CART may mediate the early signs of anxiety-like behavior induced by ethanol withdrawal within the neuroanatomical framework of the CeA.},

It plays a central role in mediating emotional behavior and has an unusually protracted development well into adulthood, increasing in size by 40\% from youth to adulthood. Variation from this typical neurodevelopmental trajectory could have profound implications on normal emotional development. We report the results of a stereological analysis of the number of neurons in amygdala nuclei of 52 human brains ranging from 2 to 48 years of age [24 neurotypical and 28 autism spectrum disorder (ASD)]. In neurotypical development, the number of mature neurons in the basal and accessory basal nuclei increases from childhood to adulthood, coinciding with a decrease of immature neurons within the paralaminar nucleus. Individuals with ASD, in contrast, show an initial excess of amygdala neurons during childhood, followed by a reduction in adulthood across nuclei. We propose that there is a long-term contribution of mature neurons from the paralaminar nucleus to other nuclei of the neurotypical human amygdala and that this growth trajectory may be altered in ASD, potentially underlying the volumetric changes detected in ASD and other neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders.},

A total of 170 regular users were recruited through snowball sampling for this cross-sectional study.

Only a small percentage of individuals who take drugs of abuse go on to develop addiction. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that a reduction in the serotonin transporter may play an important role for those that transition to compulsive drug taking. Studies have demonstrated that reduced serotonin transporter function potentiates self-administration of psychostimulant drugs (“ecstasy,” MDMA; cocaine); however, additional research revealed no differences between genotypes when the opioid heroin was self-administered. These results suggest that a reduction in the serotonin transporter may confer susceptibility to the development of addiction to some classes of drugs but not others. Importantly, the mechanism underlying facilitated psychostimulant self-administration is currently unknown.MethodsTherefore, to continue investigating the relationship between compromised serotonergic function and different classes of drugs, a series of experiments was conducted investigating locomotor activity (LMA) and conditioned taste aversion (CTA) in the serotonin transporter knockout (SERT KO) rat model.ResultsMDMA-induced hyperactivity was reduced, while MDMA-induced CTA was enhanced, in SERT KO rats. However, there were no genotype differences in heroin-induced behaviours.ConclusionsThese results reinforce the idea that a reduction in the serotonin transporter drives differential effects between disparate classes of drugs of abuse.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The serotonin hypothesis may be the model of MDD pathophysiology with the most support. The majority of antidepressants enhance synaptic serotonin levels quickly, while it usually takes weeks to discern MDD treatment effect. It has been hypothesized that the time lag between serotonin increase and reduction of MDD symptoms is due to downregulation of inhibitory receptors such as the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR). The research on 5-HT1BR has previously been hampered by a lack of selective ligands for the receptor. The last extensive review of 5-HT1BR in the pathophysiology of depression was published 2009, and based mainly on findings from animal studies. Since then, selective radioligands for in vivo quantification of brain 5-HT1BR binding with positron emission tomography has been developed, providing new knowledge on the role of 5-HT1BR in MDD and its treatment. The main focus of this review is the role of 5-HT1BR in relation to MDD and its treatment, although studies of 5-HT1BR in obsessive-compulsive disorder, alcohol dependence, and cocaine dependence are also reviewed. The evidence outlined range from animal models of disease, effects of 5-HT1B receptor agonists and antagonists, case-control studies of 5-HT1B receptor binding postmortem and in vivo, with positron emission tomography, to clinical studies of 5-HT1B receptor effects of established treatments for MDD. Low 5-HT1BR binding in limbic regions has been found in MDD patients. When 5-HT1BR ligands are administered to animals, 5-HT1BR agonists most consistently display antidepressant-like properties, though it is not yet clear how 5-HT1BR is best approached for optimal MDD treatment.},

	abstract = {The hypocretin/orexin (ORX) system has been repeatedly demonstrated to regulate motivation for drugs of abuse, including alcohol. In particular, ORX seems to be critically involved in highly motivated behaviors, as is observed in high-seeking individuals in a population, in the seeking of highly palatable substances, and in models of dependence. It seems logical that this system could be considered as a potential target for treatment for addiction, particularly alcohol addiction, as ORX pharmacological manipulations significantly reduce drinking. However, the ORX system also plays a role in a wide range of other behaviors, emotions, and physiological functions and is disrupted in a number of non-dependence-associated disorders. It is therefore important to consider how the ORX system might be optimally targeted for potential treatment for alcohol use disorders either in combination with or separate from its role in other functions or diseases. This review will focus on the role of ORX in alcohol-associated behaviors and whether and how this system could be targeted to treat alcohol use disorders while avoiding impacts on other ORX-relevant functions. A brief overview of the ORX system will be followed by a discussion of some of the factors that makes it particularly intriguing as a target for alcohol addiction treatment, a consideration of some potential challenges associated with targeting this system and, finally, some future directions to optimize new treatments.},

To this end, we pre-registered and implemented a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and baseline-controlled crossover design. A sample of 48 university students participated in the study and each of them completed the experimental tasks in four conditions (baseline, placebo, low dose, and high-dose flavanol), administered in separate sessions with a 1-week washout interval. A rapid serial visual presentation task was used to test flavanol effects on temporal attention and integration, and a visual search task was similarly employed to investigate spatial attention. Results indicated that cocoa flavanols improved visual search efficiency, reflected by reduced reaction time. However, cocoa flavanols did not facilitate temporal attention nor integration, suggesting that flavanols may affect some aspects of attention, but not others. Potential underlying mechanisms are discussed.},

	abstract = {Ecstasy (MDMA) street tablets often contain several other compounds in addition to MDMA, particularly caffeine. Then, it becomes necessary to study the consequences of caffeine plus MDMA combination. MDMA (1 mg/kg) elicited an analgesic response both at the spinal and supraspinal levels. However, when associated, MDMA and caffeine did not show any synergistic interaction. When caffeine was administered prior to MDMA, a potentiation of locomotor activity was observed, which consisted in an increase in maximal values and in a prolonged time of activity. In the neurotoxicity studies, a hyperthermic effect of MDMA was observed. Although caffeine alone failed to alter body temperature, it potentiated MDMA-induced hyperthermia. This association also significantly increased MDMA lethality (from 22\% to 34\%). Following administration of MDMA to rats, there was a persistent decrease in the number of serotonin transporter sites in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus, which was potentiated by caffeine co-treatment. This MDMA toxicity in rats was accompanied by a transient dopaminergic impairment in the striatum, measured as decreased [(3)H]WIN35428 binding sites, by 31\% 3 days after treatment, which was not modified by caffeine. A transient down-regulation of 5-HT(2) receptors occurred in the cortex of MDMA-treated rats, whose recovery was slowed by co-treatment with caffeine. In conclusion, the association of MDMA with caffeine does not generate any beneficial effects at the antinociceptive level. The acute effects stemming from this association, in tandem with the final potentiation of serotonergic terminals injury, provide evidence of the potentially greater long-term adverse effects of this particular recreational drug combination.},

The mechanism that connects these two hormones in regulating T cells has not been established. In this study, we report that progesterone is a novel inducer of vit.D receptor (VDR) in T cells and makes T cells highly sensitive to calcitriol. At the molecular level, the induction by progesterone is mediated by two progesterone receptor-binding elements in the intron region after the first noncoding exon of the human VDR gene. Increased expression of VDR by progesterone allows highly sensitive regulation of T cells by vit.D even when vit.D levels are suboptimal. This novel regulatory pathway allows enhanced induction of regulatory T cells but suppression of Th1 and Th17 cells by the two nuclear hormones. The results have significant ramifications in effective regulation of T cells to prevent adverse immune responses during pregnancy.},

	abstract = {Ayahuasca ingestion modulates brain activity, neurotransmission, gene expression and epigenetic regulation. N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT, one of the alkaloids in Ayahuasca) activates sigma 1 receptor (SIGMAR1) and others. SIGMAR1 is a multi-faceted stress-responsive receptor which promotes cell survival, neuroprotection, neuroplasticity and neuroimmunomodulation. Simultaneously, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) also present in Ayahuasca prevent the degradation of DMT. One peculiarity of SIGMAR1 activation and MAOI activity is the reversal of mnemonic deficits in pre-clinical models. Since traumatic memories in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are often characterised by “repression” and PTSD patients ingesting Ayahuasca report the retrieval of such memories, it cannot be excluded that DMT-mediated SIGMAR1 activation and the concomitant MAOIs effects during Ayahuasca ingestion might mediate such “anti-amnesic” process. Here I hypothesise that Ayahuasca, via hyperactivation of trauma and emotional memory-related centres, and via its concomitant SIGMAR1- and MAOIs- induced anti-amnesic effects, facilitates the retrieval of traumatic memories, in turn making them labile (destabilised). As Ayahuasca alkaloids enhance synaptic plasticity, increase neurogenesis and boost dopaminergic neurotransmission, and those processes are involved in memory reconsolidation and fear extinction, the fear response triggered by the memory can be reprogramed and/or extinguished. Subsequently, the memory is stored with this updated significance. To date, it is unclear if new memories replace, co-exist with or bypass old ones. Although the mechanisms involved in memory are still debated, they seem to require the involvement of cellular and molecular events, such as reorganization of homo and heteroreceptor complexes at the synapse, synaptic plasticity, and epigenetic re-modulation of gene expression. Since SIGMAR1 mobilizes synaptic receptor, boosts synaptic plasticity and modulates epigenetic processes, such effects might be involved in the reported healing of traumatic memories in PTSD patients. If this theory proves to be true, Ayahuasca could come to represent the only standing pharmacological treatment which targets traumatic memories in PTSD. Lastly, since SIGMAR1 activation triggers both epigenetic and immunomodulatory programs, the mechanism here presented could help understanding and treating other conditions in which the cellular memory is dysregulated, such as cancer, diabetes, autoimmune and neurodegenerative pathologies and substance addiction.},

Among the multiple 5-HT receptors (5-HTRs) involved, the 5-HT2CR seems to play a pivotal role. Yet, the role of 5-HT2ARs in the control of the LHb neuronal activity is completely unknown. Methods Single-cell extracellular recording of the LHb neurons was used in rats to study the effect of the general activation and blockade of the 5-HT2CR and 5-HT2AR with Ro 60-0175 and SB242084, TCB-2 and MDL11939, respectively. The expression of both receptors in the LHb was confirmed using immunohistochemistry. Results Cumulative doses (5-640 μg/kg, iv) of Ro 60-0175 and TCB-2 affected the activity of 34\% and 63\% of the LHb recorded neurons, respectively. LHb neurons were either inhibited at low doses or excited at higher doses of the 5-HT2A/CR agonists. SB242084 or MDL11939 (both at 200 μg/kg, iv) did not modify neuronal firing when injected alone, but reverted the bidirectional effects of Ro 60-0175 or TCB-2, respectively. 5-HT2CRs and 5-HT2ARs are expressed in less than the 20\% of the LHb neurons, and they neither colocalize nor make heterodimers. Strikingly, only 5-HT2ARs are expressed by the majority of LHb astrocyte cells. Conclusions Peripheral administration of 5-HT2AR agonist promotes a heterogeneous pattern of neuronal responses in the LHb, and these effects are more prominent than those induced by the 5-HT2CR activation.},

METHOD: The authors investigated cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding in eight adults with Asperger's syndrome and in 10 healthy comparison subjects with single photon emission computed tomography and the selective 5-HT2A receptor ligand 123I iodinated 4-amino-N-[1-[3-(4-fluorophenoxy)propyl]-4-methyl-4-piperidinyl]-5-iodo-2-methoxybenzamide (123I-5-I-R91150).
RESULTS: People with Asperger's syndrome had a significant reduction in cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding in the total, anterior, and posterior cingulate; bilaterally in the frontal and superior temporal lobes; and in the left parietal lobe. Also, reduced receptor binding was significantly related to abnormal social communication.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings suggest that adults with Asperger's syndrome have abnormalities in cortical 5-HT2A receptor density and that this deficit may underlie some clinical symptoms.},

How do these effects relate to the clinical efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapies? Efforts to understand psychedelic phenomena date back more than a century in Western science. In this article I review scientific theories of psychedelic drug effects and highlight key theoretical features which have endured over the last 125 years of psychedelic science. First, I describe the subjective phenomenology of acute psychedelic effects using the best available empirical data. Next, I review late 19th-century and early 20th-century theories—model psychoses theory, filtration theory, and psychoanalytic theory—and highlight their shared theoretical features. I then briefly review recent neuropharmacological and neurophysiological findings. Finally, I describe some recent theories of psychedelic drug effects that leverage 21st-century cognitive neuroscience frameworks—entropic brain theory, integrated information theory, and predictive processing—highlighting their shared theoretical features and pointing out how they link back to earlier theories. From this analysis a key theoretical concept is identified which cuts across many theories past and present: psychedelic drugs perturb specific brain processes which normally sustain constraints on perceptual, affective, cognitive, and self-related neural systems. While a truly unifying theory has yet to emerge, I suggest that the enduring theoretical features and formalized frameworks highlighted in this article could form a groundwork for future unifying theories of psychedelic drug effects.},

	abstract = {Accurately and efficiently perceiving social cues such as body movements and facial expressions is important in social interaction. Accurate social perception of this kind does not solely rely on “bottom-up” visual processing but is also subject to modulation by “top-down” signals. For example, if instructed to look for signs of happiness rather than fear, participants are more likely to categorize facial expressions as happy—this prior expectation biases subsequent perception. Top-down modulation is also important in our reactions to others. For example, top-down control over imitation plays an important role in the development of smooth and harmonious social interactions. This paper highlights the importance of top-down modulation in our perception of, and reactions to, others. We discuss evidence that top-down modulation of social perception and imitation is atypical in Autism Spectrum Conditions and in schizophrenia, and we consider the effect this may have on the development of social interactions for individuals with these developmental disorders.},

	abstract = {Chronic use of opioid analgesics has been hindered by the development of opioid addiction and tolerance. We have reported that curcumin, a natural flavonoid from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, attenuated opioid tolerance, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that curcumin may inhibit Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II α (CaMKIIα), a protein kinase that has been previously proposed to be critical for opioid tolerance and dependence. In this study, we used state-of-the-art polymeric formulation technology to produce poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-curcumin nanoparticles (nanocurcumin) to overcome the drug’s poor solubility and bioavailability, which has made it extremely difficult for studying in vivo pharmacological actions of curcumin. We found that PLGA-curcumin nanoparticles reduced the dose requirement by 11- to 33-fold. Pretreatment with PLGA-curcumin (by mouth) prevented the development of opioid tolerance and dependence in a dose-dependent manner, with ED50 values of 3.9 and 3.2 mg/kg, respectively. PLGA-curcumin dose-dependently attenuated already-established opioid tolerance (ED50 = 12.6 mg/kg p.o.) and dependence (ED50 = 3.1 mg/kg p.o.). Curcumin or PLGA-curcumin did not produce antinociception by itself or affect morphine (1–10 mg/kg) antinociception. Moreover, we found that the behavioral effects of curcumin on opioid tolerance and dependence correlated with its inhibition of morphine-induced CaMKIIα activation in the brain. These results suggest that curcumin may attenuate opioid tolerance and dependence by suppressing CaMKIIα activity.},

	abstract = {Background
There is growing debate on the use of drugs that promote cognitive enhancement. Amphetamine-like drugs have been employed as cognitive enhancers, but they show important side effects and induce addiction. In this study, we investigated the use of modafinil which appears to have less side effects compared to other amphetamine-like drugs. We analyzed effects on cognitive performances and brain resting state network activity of 26 healthy young subjects.

Methodology
A single dose (100 mg) of modafinil was administered in a double-blind and placebo-controlled study. Both groups were tested for neuropsychological performances with the Ravenâ€™s Advanced Progressive Matrices II set (APM) before and three hours after administration of drug or placebo. Resting state functional magnetic resonance (rs-FMRI) was also used, before and after three hours, to investigate changes in the activity of resting state brain networks. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) was employed to evaluate differences in structural connectivity between the two groups. Protocol ID: Modrest\_2011; NCT01684306; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01684306.

Principal Findings
Results indicate that a single dose of modafinil improves cognitive performance as assessed by APM. Rs-fMRI showed that the drug produces a statistically significant increased activation of Frontal Parietal Control (FPC; p{\textless}0.04) and Dorsal Attention (DAN; p{\textless}0.04) networks. No modifications in structural connectivity were observed.

Conclusions and Significance
Overall, our findings support the notion that modafinil has cognitive enhancing properties and provide functional connectivity data to support these effects.

One of them is the use of entheogenic substances, like ayahuasca, an infusion obtained from two native plant species from the Amazon. The present report aimed to understand how crack cocaine users recover from drug addiction by consuming ayahuasca tea in a religious context. This is a qualitative study with a purposeful sample of 40 crack cocaine users, based on in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Participants reported that ayahuasca allowed them to access a consciousness dimension which enabled them to solve problems and traumas and reduce crack cocaine consumption. The religious ceremony increased the userâ€™s spirituality and the reception from the community gave them a sense of self-esteem, strengthening them in an emotional and social way. That positive experience has been incorporated into the daily routine of most participants. Findings indicate that ayahuasca, in a religious context, may have therapeutic value for crack cocaine dependence treatment.},

The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and bioavailability of two formulations with the established reference formulation of huperzine A in a fasting, healthy Chinese male population. This was a randomized, single-dose, 3-period, 6-sequence crossover study. The plasma concentrations of huperzine A were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Tolerability was assessed based on subject interview, vital sign monitoring, physical examination, and routine blood and urine tests. The mean (SD) pharmacokinetic parameters of the reference drug were Cmax, 1.550 (0.528) ng/mL; t1/2, 12.092 (1.898) h; AUC0-72h, 17.550 (3.794) ng·h/mL. Those of the test formulation A and test formulation B were Cmax, 1.412 (0.467), 1.521 (0.608) ng/mL; t1/2, 12.073 (2.068), 12.271 (1.678) h; AUC0-72h, 15.286 (3.434) ng·h/mL, 15.673 (3.586) ng·h/mL. The 90\% confidence intervals for the AUC0-72h and Cmax were between 0.80 and 1.25. No adverse events were reported by the subjects or found with results of clinical laboratory test. The test and reference products met the regulatory criteria for bioequivalence in these fasting, healthy Chinese male volunteers. All three formulations appeared to be well tolerated.},

Thus, upregulation of the Klotho gene can potentially alleviate the symptoms and/or prevent the progression of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Here we used a CRISPR-dCas9 complex to investigate single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the Klotho promoter region for efficient transcriptional activation of the Klotho gene. We tested the sgRNAs within the − 1 to − 300 bp of the Klotho promoter region and identified two sgRNAs that can effectively enhance Klotho gene transcription. We examined the transcriptional activation of the Klotho gene using three different systems: a Firefly luciferase (FLuc) and NanoLuc luciferase (NLuc) coincidence reporter system, a NLuc knock-in in Klotho 3′-UTR using CRISPR genomic editing, and two human cell lines: neuronal SY5Y cells and kidney HK-2 cells that express Klotho endogenously. The two sgRNAs enhanced Klotho expression at both the gene and protein levels. Our results show the feasibility of gene therapy for targeting Klotho using CRISPR technology. Enhancing Klotho levels has a therapeutic potential for increasing cognition and treating age-associated neurodegenerative, demyelinating and other diseases, such as chronic kidney disease and cancer.},

At the same time, ongoing international efforts to further and more deeply investigate the brain's complex neuronal circuitry are creating unprecedented capabilities to both understand and control neurological processes of thought, emotion, and behavior. These advances have tremendous promise for human health, but the potential for their misuse has also been noted, with most discussions centering on research and development of agents that are addressed by existing BWC and Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) proscriptions. In this article, we discuss the dual-use possibilities fostered by employing emergent biotechnologic techniques and tools—specifically, novel gene editors like clustered regular interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)—to produce neuroweapons. Based on our analyses, we posit the strong likelihood that development of genetically modified or created neurotropic substances will advance apace with other gene-based therapeutics, and we assert that this represents a novel—and realizable—path to creating potential neuroweapons. In light of this, we propose that it will be important to re-address current categorizations of weaponizable tools and substances, so as to better inform and generate tractable policy to enable improved surveillance and governance of novel neuroweapons.},

“The term ‘higher consciousness’ is often used by spiritually-minded people to describe important but hard-to-reach mental states.
Hindu sages, Christian monks and Buddhist ascetics all speak of reaching moments of ‘higher consciousness’ – through meditation or chanting, fasting or pilgrimages...”

LSD is well-known to induce perceptual alterations, but unknown is whether LSD alters emotional processing in ways that can support psychotherapy. We investigated the acute effects of LSD on emotional processing using the Face Emotion Recognition Task (FERT) and Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET). The effects of LSD on social behavior were tested using the Social Value Orientation (SVO) test. Two similar placebo-controlled, double-blind, random-order, crossover studies were conducted using 100 μg LSD in 24 subjects and 200 μg LSD in 16 subjects. All of the subjects were healthy and mostly hallucinogen-naive 25- to 65-year-old volunteers (20 men, 20 women). LSD produced feelings of happiness, trust, closeness to others, enhanced explicit and implicit emotional empathy on the MET, and impaired the recognition of sad and fearful faces on the FERT. LSD enhanced the participants' desire to be with other people and increased their prosocial behavior on the SVO test. These effects of LSD on emotion processing and sociality may be useful for LSD-assisted psychotherapy.},

The purpose of this study was to determine whether misclassifying former and occasional drinkers as abstainers and other potentially confounding study characteristics underlie observed positive health outcomes for low-volume drinkers in prospective studies of all-cause mortality.

Method:
A systematic review and meta-regression analysis of studies investigating alcohol use and mortality risk after controlling for quality-related study characteristics was conducted in a population of 3,998,626 individuals, among whom 367,103 deaths were recorded.

Results:
Without adjustment, meta-analysis of all 87 included studies replicated the classic J-shaped curve, with low-volume drinkers (1.3–24.9 g ethanol per day) having reduced mortality risk (RR = 0.86, 95\% CI [0.83, 0.90]). Occasional drinkers ({\textless}1.3 g per day) had similar mortality risk (RR = 0.84, 95\% CI [0.79, 0.89]), and former drinkers had elevated risk (RR = 1.22, 95\% CI [1.14, 1.31]). After adjustment for abstainer biases and quality-related study characteristics, no significant reduction in mortality risk was observed for low-volume drinkers (RR = 0.97, 95\% CI [0.88, 1.07]). Analyses of higher-quality bias-free studies also failed to find reduced mortality risk for low-volume alcohol drinkers. Risk estimates for occasional drinkers were similar to those for low- and medium-volume drinkers.

Conclusions:
Estimates of mortality risk from alcohol are significantly altered by study design and characteristics. Meta-analyses adjusting for these factors find that low-volume alcohol consumption has no net mortality benefit compared with lifetime abstention or occasional drinking. These findings have implications for public policy, the formulation of low-risk drinking guidelines, and future research on alcohol and health.},

	abstract = {Developing methods for improving creativity is of broad interest. Classic psychedelics may enhance creativity; however, the underlying mechanisms of action are unknown. This study was designed to assess whether a relationship exists between naturalistic classic psychedelic use and heightened creative problem-solving ability and if so, whether this is mediated by lifetime mystical experience. Participants (N = 68) completed a survey battery assessing lifetime mystical experience and circumstances surrounding the most memorable experience. They were then administered a functional fixedness task in which faster completion times indicate greater creative problem-solving ability. Participants reporting classic psychedelic use concurrent with mystical experience (n = 11) exhibited significantly faster times on the functional fixedness task (Cohen's d = -.87; large effect) and significantly greater lifetime mystical experience (Cohen's d = .93; large effect) than participants not reporting classic psychedelic use concurrent with mystical experience. However, lifetime mystical experience was unrelated to completion times on the functional fixedness task (standardized β = -.06), and was therefore not a significant mediator. Classic psychedelic use may increase creativity independent of its effects on mystical experience. Maximizing the likelihood of mystical experience may need not be a goal of psychedelic interventions designed to boost creativity.},

	abstract = {The recreational drug (+/)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “ecstasy”) is a methamphetamine derivative that selectively destroys central 5-HT axons and axon terminals in animals and, possibly, humans. The fate of 5-HT neurons following MDMA injury is uncertain. In particular, while it is known that central 5-HT axons can undergo regenerative sprouting after MDMA injury, it has not been determined whether they reestablish the original innervation pattern. To address this question, the present studies examined 5-HT innervation patterns in animals lesioned with MDMA 12–18 months previously. Both rodents (rats) and nonhuman primates (squirrel monkeys) were examined, since there is indication that serotonergic recovery after MDMA injury may be species dependent. 5-HT axon projections were studied neurochemically, autoradiographically and immunocytochemically. In both rodents and nonhuman primates previously lesioned with MDMA, substantial serotonergic axonal sprouting was observed. However, in a few rats and in most squirrel monkeys, the reinnervation pattern was highly abnormal: distant targets (e.g., dorsal neocortex) remained denervated, while some proximal targets (e.g., amygdala, hypothalamus) were reinnervated or hyperinnervated. Although the specific determinants of axonal recovery after MDMA injury remain to be identified, it appears that axons which initially sustain more severe damage, are longer, or are more highly arborized have low probability of recovering. The observation that some brain regions remain denervated, while others are reinnervated or hyperinnervated suggests that, under some circumstances, MDMA injury can lead to a lasting reorganization of ascending 5-HT axon projections. Such lasting changes in brain innervation, documented here in MDMA-treated animals, may have implications for humans using MDMA recreationally.},

We describe here a new, easy, efficient, and environmentally friendly chemical synthesis of l-theanine and l-γ-N-propyl-Gln and their corresponding d-isomers. l-Theanine, and its derivatives obtained so far, exhibited partial coagonistic action at N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, with no detectable agonist effect at other glutamate receptors, on cultured hippocampal neurons. This activity was retained on NMDA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In addition, both GluN2A and GluN2B containing NMDA receptors were equally modulated by l-theanine. The stereochemical change from l-theanine to d-theanine along with the substitution of the ethyl for a propyl moiety in the γ-N position of l- and d-theanine significantly enhanced the biological efficacy, as measured on cultured hippocampal neurons. l-Theanine structure thus represents an interesting backbone to develop novel NMDA receptor modulators.},

Everolimus (EVL) is an immunosuppressant indicated for allograft rejection and cancer therapy, but with narrow therapeutic window. EVL is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). This study investigated the effect of coadministration of curcumin on the pharmacokinetics of EVL in rats and the underlying mechanisms. EVL (0.5 mg/kg) was orally administered without and with 50 and 100 mg/kg of curcumin, respectively, in rats. Blood samples were collected at specific time points and EVL concentrations in blood were determined by QMSÂ® immunoassay. The underlying mechanisms were evaluated using cell model and recombinant CYP 3A4 isozyme. The results indicated that 50 and 100 mg/kg of curcumin significantly decreased the AUC0-540 of EVL by 70.6\% and 71.5\%, respectively, and both dosages reduced the Cmax of EVL by 76.7\%. Mechanism studies revealed that CYP3A4 was markedly activated by curcumin metabolites, which apparently overrode the inhibition effects of curcumin on P-gp. In conclusion, oral intake of curcumin significantly decreased the bioavailability of EVL, a probe substrate of P-gp/CYP 3A4, mainly through marked activation on CYP 3A4.},

N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), a popular thiol antioxidant, has been clinically used to treat various pathophysiological disorders. However, NAC therapy is routine only in paracetamol intoxication and as a mucolytic agent. Over six decades, numerous studies involving NAC therapy have yielded inconsistent results, and this could be due to low bioavailability. In order to overcome the limitations of NAC, an amide derivative N-Acetylcysteine amide (NACA) has been synthesized to improve the lipophilicity, membrane permeability, and antioxidant property. Recent studies have demonstrated the blood-brain barrier permeability and therapeutic potentials of NACA in neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Multiple sclerosis, Tardive dyskinesia, and HIV-associated neurological disorders. In addition, NACA displays protective effect against pulmonary inflammation and antibiotic-induced apoptosis. Forthcoming research on the possible therapeutic properties of NACA and its generics in the management of pathologies associated with extracellular matrix degradation and oxidative stress-related inflammation is highly exiting. Superior bioavailability of NACA is likely to fulfill the promises of NAC as well as a molecule to improve the endurance and resident time of bioscaffolds and biomaterials. Till date, more than 800 reviews on NAC have been published. However, no comprehensive review is available on the therapeutic applications of NACA. Therefore, the current review would be the first to emphasize the therapeutic potentials of NACA and its derivatives.},

Of the antioxidant properties that were investigated, NACA was shown to possess higher 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) radical scavenging ability and reducing power than NAC, at all the concentrations, whereas the scavenging ability of H2O2 differed with concentration. While NACA had greater H2O2 scavenging capacity at the highest concentration, NAC was better than NACA at lower concentrations. NAC and NACA had a 60\% and 55\% higher ability to prevent β-carotene bleaching, respectively, as compared to control. The chelating activity of NACA was more than 50\% that of the metal chelating capacity of EDTA and four and nine times that of BHT and α-tocopherol, respectively.

	abstract = {Recent large clinical trials failed to confirm the supposed beneficial effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in preventing oxidative stress-related diseases. This may be due to its low bioavailability. We thought that esterification of the carboxyl group of NAC to produce N-acetylcysteine ethyl ester (NACET) would drastically increase the lipophilicity of NAC, thus greatly improving its pharmacokinetics. In the present work, we report on representative chemical, pharmacological and anti-oxidant properties of NACET, especially in direct comparison with its congener NAC. We found that NACET is rapidly absorbed in rats after oral administration but reaches very low concentrations in plasma. This is due to a unique feature of NACET: it rapidly enters the cells where it is trapped being transformed into NAC and cysteine. After oral treatment, NACET (but not NAC) was able to increase significantly the glutathione content of most tissues examined, brain included, and to protect from paracetamol intoxication in the rat. NACET has also the unique feature to accumulate in human erythrocytes where it behaves as a potent protector against hydroperoxide-induced oxidative damage. Our study shows that being able to enter cells and to produce NAC and cysteine, NACET increases circulating hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), thus representing a good candidate for the oral use as an H(2)S producer, with clear advantages over NAC. NACET has the potential to substitute NAC as a mucolytic agent, as a paracetamol antidote and as a GSH-related antioxidant.},

The number of officially registered illicit substance misusers totals close to 3 million, having increased every year since the government’s first annual report on drug control in 1998. In recent years, synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine and ketamine, have become more popular than heroin which was previously dominant. However, illicit substance use continues to receive little sympathy from the public, despite government’s efforts to move towards treatment and rehabilitation. For many years, compulsory detoxification centers and “education-through-labor” camps were the only treatment options. More humane approaches are emerging, including methadone maintenance, therapeutic communities, and faith-based halfway houses. Government response to drug trafficking remains draconian. Drug distribution and trafficking are among the dwindling number of criminal offenses that qualify for the death penalty. For future drug control policy, China appears willing to accelerate its experiment with decriminalizing substance abuse and applying a public health approach to the treatment of substance misusers. Evidence-based treatment programs through scientific research and rigorous evaluation should be the norm, and harm reduction needs to be seriously explored as an alternative to the harsh criminal justice regime. More importantly, reliable and multi-faceted forecast systems need to be established to monitor and estimate the size of substance misuser population and trends in illicit drug consumption. Finally, China should continue to expand its international collaboration and insulate its counter-narcotic programs from global politics.},

Young adult rhesus macaques either experienced MDMA only, a combination of amphetamines (MDMA, MDA and methamphetamine) or no amphetamines (controls) and hippocampal tissue was processed for immunohistochemical analysis.Quantitative stereological analysis showed that intermittent exposure to MDMA or the three amphetamines over 9.6â€¯months causes {\textgreater}80\% decrease in the number of Ki-67 cells (actively dividing NPCs) and {\textgreater}50\% decrease in the number of NeuroD1 cells (NPCs that have attained a neuronal phenotype). Co-labeling analysis revealed distinct, actively dividing hippocampal NPCs in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus that were in transition from stem-like radial glia-like cells (type-1) to immature transiently amplifying neuroblasts (type-2a, type-2b, and type-3).MDMA-alone and the combination reduced the number of dividing type-1 and type-3 NPCs and cells that were not NPCs. These data indicate that amphetamines interfere with the division and migration of NPCs. Notably, the reduction in the number of NPCs and immature neurons were not associated with changes in cell death (via apoptosis) or granule cell neuron numbers, indicating that amphetamines selectively affected the generation and maturation of newly born granule cell neurons. In sum, our findings suggest that alterations in the cellular composition in the dentate gyrus during chronic exposure to amphetamines can effect neuroplasticity in the hippocampus and influence functional properties of hippocampal neurons.},

	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Extracts from and alkaloids contained in plants in the genus Sceletium have been reported to inhibit ligand binding to serotonin transporter. From this, the conclusion was made that Sceletium products act as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors. However, other mechanisms which may similarly result in the anxiolytic or anti-depressant effect ascribed to Sceletium, such as monoamine release, have not been investigated.
AIMS OF THE STUDY: The current study investigated simultaneously and at two consecutive time points, the effect of high-mesembrine Sceletium extract on both monoamine release and serotonin reuptake into both human astrocytes and mouse hippocampal neurons, as well as potential inhibitory effects on relevant enzyme activities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human astrocytes and mouse hippocampal cells were treated with citalopram or Sceletium extract for 15 and 30min, after which protein expression levels of serotonin transporter (SERT) and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VAMT-2) was assessed using fluorescent immunocytochemistry and digital image analysis. Efficacy of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidate-A (MAO-A) activity were assessed using the Ellman and Olsen methods (and appropriate controls) respectively.
RESULTS: We report the first investigation of mechanism of action of Sceletium extract in the context of serotonin transport, release and reuptake in a cellular model. Cell viability was not affected by Sceletium treatment. High-mesembrine Sceletium extract down-regulated SERT expression similarly to citalopram. In addition, VMAT-2 was upregulated significantly in response to Sceletium treatment. The extract showed only relatively mild inhibition of AChE and MAO-A.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the serotonin reuptake inhibition activity ascribed to the Sceletium plant, is a secondary function to the monoamine-releasing activity of high-mesembrine Sceletium extract (Trimesemine(TM)).},

	abstract = {Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by restricted, stereotyped behaviors and impairments in social communication. Although the underlying biological mechanisms of ASD remain poorly understood, recent preclinical research has implicated the endogenous cannabinoid (or endocannabinoid), anandamide, as a significant neuromodulator in rodent models of ASD. Despite this promising preclinical evidence, no clinical studies to date have tested whether endocannabinoids are dysregulated in individuals with ASD. Here, we addressed this critical gap in knowledge by optimizing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methodology to quantitatively analyze anandamide concentrations in banked blood samples collected from a cohort of children with and without ASD (N = 112).
Findings: Anandamide concentrations significantly differentiated ASD cases (N = 59) from controls (N = 53), such that children with lower anandamide concentrations were more likely to have ASD (p = 0.041). In keeping with this notion, anandamide concentrations were also significantly lower in ASD compared to control children (p = 0.034).
Conclusions: These findings are the first empirical human data to translate preclinical rodent findings to confirm a link between plasma anandamide concentrations in children with ASD. Although preliminary, these data suggest that impaired anandamide signaling may be involved in the pathophysiology of ASD.},

After chemical synthesis, hispidulin was investigated at recombinant GABA(A)/BZD receptors expressed by Xenopus laevis oocytes. Concentrations of 50 nm and higher stimulated the GABA-induced chloride currents at tested receptor subtypes (alpha(1-3,5,6)beta(2)gamma(2)S) indicating positive allosteric properties. Maximal stimulation at alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2)S was observed with 10 microm hispidulin. In contrast to diazepam, hispidulin modulated the alpha(6)beta(2)gamma(2)S-GABA(A) receptor subtype. When fed to seizure-prone Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) in a model of epilepsy, hispidulin (10 mg kg(-1) body weight (BW) per day) and diazepam (2 mg kg(-1) BW per day) markedly reduced the number of animals suffering from seizures after 7 days of treatment (30 and 25\% of animals in the respective treatment groups, vs 80\% in the vehicle group). Permeability across the blood-brain barrier for the chemically synthesized, (14)C-labelled hispidulin was confirmed by a rat in situ perfusion model. With an uptake rate (K(in)) of 1.14 ml min(-1) g(-1), measurements approached the values obtained with highly penetrating compounds such as diazepam. Experiments with Caco-2 cells predict that orally administered hispidulin enters circulation in its intact form.

Stimulants normally act at the dopamine transporter (DAT) and thus increase dopamine (DA) availability in the brain, including nucleus accumbens, within the reward and addiction pathway. This paper aims to assess DAT responses to dissociative diarylethylamine NPS by means of in vitro and in silico approaches. We compared diphenidine (DPH) and 2-methoxydiphenidine (methoxphenidine, 2-MXP/MXP) for their binding to rat DAT, using autoradiography assessment of [125I]RTI-121 displacement in rat striatal sections. The drugs’ effects on electrically-evoked DA efflux were measured by means of fast cyclic voltammetry in rat accumbens slices. Computational modeling, molecular dynamics and alchemical free energy simulations were used to analyse the atomistic changes within DAT in response to each of the five dissociatives: DPH, 2-MXP, 3-MXP, 4-MXP and 2-Cl-DPH, and to calculate their relative binding free energy. DPH increased DA efflux as a result of its binding to DAT, whereas MXP had no significant effect on either DAT binding or evoked DA efflux. Our computational findings corroborate the above and explain the conformational responses and atomistic processes within DAT during its interactions with the dissociative NPS. We suggest DPH can have addictive liability, unlike MXP, despite the chemical similarities of these two NPS.},

However, little is known about which chemical compounds can act as olfactory threat signals in humans. We hypothesized that brief exposure to putrescine, a chemical compound produced by the breakdown of fatty acids in the decaying tissue of dead bodies, can function as a chemosensory warning signal, activating threat management responses (e.g., heightened alertness, fight-or-flight responses). This hypothesis was tested by gaging peopleâ€™s responses to conscious and non-conscious exposure to putrescine. In Experiment 1, putrescine increased vigilance, as measured by a reaction time task. In Experiments 2 and 3, brief exposure to putrescine (vs. ammonia and a scentless control condition) prompted participants to walk away faster from the exposure site. Experiment 3 also showed that putrescine elicited implicit cognitions related to escape and threat. Experiment 4 found that exposure to putrescine, presented here below the threshold of conscious awareness, increased hostility toward an out-group member. Together, the results are the first to indicate that humans can process putrescine as a warning signal that mobilizes protective responses to deal with relevant threats. The implications of these results are briefly discussed.},

In this video I use two methods to produce cadaverine:

1. Basic heating: This is not very efficient and burns a lot of the cadaverine. 

2. Destructive distillation: I use an improvised destructive distillation setup. This method is much more efficient because it is carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. Higher temperatures can be used without risking burning. 

I honestly did not proceed further in the second method because of the putrid smell. A lot more cadaverine was produced and the smell was making me nauseous.

	abstract = {RationalePreclinical studies suggest that the GABAB receptor is a potential target for treatment of substance use disorders. However, recent clinical trials report adverse effects in patients treated with the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen and even question efficacy. How can the discrepancy between preclinical and clinical findings be explained?ObjectiveTo test efficacy and adverse effects of baclofen and the novel GABAB positive allosteric modulator (PAM) CMPPE in rat addiction models, which were developed in accordance with DSM.MethodsWe used a well-characterized rat model of long-term alcohol consumption with repeated deprivation phases that result in compulsive alcohol drinking in a relapse situation, and a rat model of long-term intravenous cocaine self-administration resulting in key symptoms of addictive behavior. We tested repeated baclofen (0, 1, and 3 mg/kg; i.p.) and CMPPE doses (0, 10, and 30 mg/kg; i.p.) in relapse-like situations, in either alcohol or cocaine addicted-like rats.ResultsBaclofen produced a weak anti-relapse effect at the highest dose in alcohol addicted-like rats, and this effect was mainly due to the treatment-induced sedation. CMPPE had a better profile, with a dose-dependent reduction of relapse-like alcohol drinking and without any signs of sedation. The cue-induced cocaine-seeking response was completely abolished by both compounds.ConclusionPositive allosteric modulation of the GABAB receptor provides efficacy, and no observable side effects in relapse behavior whereas baclofen may cause, not only sedation, but also considerable impairment of food intake or metabolism. However, targeting GABAB receptors may be effective in reducing certain aspects of addictive-like behavior, such as cue-reactivity.},

	abstract = {RationaleAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment, neuronal death, and synaptic loss in the hippocampus. Long-term potentiation (LTP), a type of synaptic plasticity, occurs during learning and memory. Serotonin receptor type 7 (5-HTR7) activation is suggested as a possible therapeutic target for AD.ObjectiveThe aim of the present study was to examine the effects of chronic treatment with the 5-HTR7 agonist, AS19, on cognitive function, memory, hippocampal plasticity, amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque accumulation, and apoptosis in an adult rat model of AD.MethodsAD was induced in rats using Aβ (single 1 μg/μL intracerebroventricular (icv) injection during surgery). The following experimental groups were included: control, sham-operated, Aβ + saline (1 μL icv for 30 days), and Aβ + AS19 (1 μg/μL icv for 30 days) groups. The animals were tested for cognition and memory performance using the novel object recognition and passive avoidance tests, respectively. Next, anesthetized rats were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus for electrode implantation, and field potentials were recorded in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Lastly, brains were removed and Aβ plaques and neuronal apoptosis were evaluated using Congo red staining and TUNEL assay, respectively.ResultsAdministration of AS19 in the Aβ rats increased the discrimination index of the novel object recognition test. Furthermore, AS19 treatment decreased time spent in the dark compartment during the passive avoidance test. AS19 also enhanced both the population spike (PS) amplitude and the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope evoked potentials of the LTP components. Aβ plaques and neuronal apoptosis were decreased in the AS19-treated Aβ rats.ConclusionsThese results indicate that chronic treatment with a 5-HTR7 agonist can prevent Aβ-related impairments in cognition and memory performance by alleviating Aβ plaque accumulation and neuronal apoptosis, hence improving neuronal plasticity. AS19 may be useful as a therapeutic agent for AD.},

Post hoc analyses revealed that only placebo-treated subjects improved over time (p = 0.03). There was a significant decrease in PANSS Total scores over time (p {\textless} 0. 0001) but there was no significant drug × time interaction (p = 0.18). Side effects were similar between CBD and placebo, with the one exception being sedation, which was more prevalent in the CBD group.ConclusionsAt the dose studied, CBD augmentation was not associated with an improvement in MCCB or PANSS scores in stable antipsychotic-treated outpatients with schizophrenia.

	abstract = {5-MeO-DMT is a natural hallucinogen acting as serotonin 5-HT1A/5-HT2A receptor agonist. Its ability to evoke hallucinations could be used to study the neurobiology of psychotic symptoms and to identify new treatment targets. Moreover, recent studies revealed the therapeutic potential of serotonin hallucinogens in treating mood and anxiety disorders. Our previous results in anesthetized animals show that 5-MeO-DMT alters cortical activity via 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. Here, we examined 5-MeO-DMT effects on oscillatory activity in prefrontal (PFC) and visual (V1) cortices, and in mediodorsal thalamus (MD) of freely-moving wild-type (WT) and 5-HT2A-R knockout (KO2A) mice. We performed local field potential multi-recordings evaluating the power at different frequency bands and coherence between areas. We also examined the prevention of 5-MeO-DMT effects by the 5-HT1A-R antagonist WAY-100635. 5-MeO-DMT affected oscillatory activity more in cortical than in thalamic areas. More marked effects were observed in delta power in V1 of KO2A mice. 5-MeO-DMT increased beta band coherence between all examined areas. In KO2A mice, WAY100635 prevented most of 5-MeO-DMT effects on oscillatory activity. The present results indicate that hallucinatory activity of 5-MeO-DMT is likely mediated by simultaneous alteration of prefrontal and visual activities. The prevention of these effects by WAY-100635 in KO2A mice supports the potential usefulness of 5-HT1A receptor antagonists to treat visual hallucinations. 5-MeO-DMT effects on PFC theta activity and cortico-thalamic coherence may be related to its antidepressant activity.},

Music is considered an important component in the treatment model, but little empirical research has been done to examine the magnitude and nature of its therapeutic role.ObjectivesThe present study assessed the influence of music on the acute experience and clinical outcomes of psychedelic therapy.MethodsSemi-structured interviews inquired about the different ways in which music influenced the experience of 19 patients undergoing psychedelic therapy with psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was applied to the interview data to identify salient themes. In addition, ratings were given for each patient for the extent to which they expressed “liking,” “resonance” (the music being experienced as “harmonious” with the emotional state of the listener), and “openness” (acceptance of the music-evoked experience).ResultsAnalyses of the interviews revealed that the music had both “welcome” and “unwelcome” influences on patients’ subjective experiences. Welcome influences included the evocation of personally meaningful and therapeutically useful emotion and mental imagery, a sense of guidance, openness, and the promotion of calm and a sense of safety. Conversely, unwelcome influences included the evocation of unpleasant emotion and imagery, a sense of being misguided and resistance. Correlation analyses showed that patients’ experience of the music was associated with the occurrence of “mystical experiences” and “insightfulness.” Crucially, the nature of the music experience was significantly predictive of reductions in depression 1 week after psilocybin, whereas general drug intensity was not.ConclusionsThis study indicates that music plays a central therapeutic function in psychedelic therapy.},

Preclinical and clinical studies of nicotinic effects on mood, anxiety, aggression, and related behaviors, such as irritability and agitation, suggest that smokers may use the nicotine in tobacco products as an attempt to self-medicate symptoms of affective disorders. The role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in circuits regulating mood and anxiety are beginning to be elucidated in animal models, but the mechanisms underlying the effects of nicotine on aggression-related behavioral states (ARBS) are still not understood. Clinical trials of nicotine or nicotinic medications for neurological and psychiatric disorders have often found effects of nicotinic medications on ARBS, but few trials have studied these outcomes systematically. Similarly, the increase in ARBS resulting from smoking cessation can be resolved by nicotinic agents, but the effects of nicotinic medications on these types of mental states and behaviors in non-smokers are less well understood. Here we review the literature on the role of nAChRs in regulating mood and anxiety, and subsequently on the closely related construct of ARBS. We suggest avenues for future study to identify how nAChRs and nicotinic agents may play a role in these clinically important areas.},

	abstract = {The circadian clock imposes daily rhythms in cell proliferation, metabolism, inflammation and DNA damage response. Perturbations of these processes are hallmarks of cancer and chronic circadian rhythm disruption predisposes individuals to tumour development. This raises the hypothesis that pharmacological modulation of the circadian machinery may be an effective therapeutic strategy for combating cancer. REV-ERBs, the nuclear hormone receptors REV-ERBα (also known as NR1D1) and REV-ERBβ (also known as NR1D2), are essential components of the circadian clock. Here we show that two agonists of REV-ERBs-SR9009 and SR9011-are specifically lethal to cancer cells and oncogene-induced senescent cells, including melanocytic naevi, and have no effect on the viability of normal cells or tissues. The anticancer activity of SR9009 and SR9011 affects a number of oncogenic drivers (such as HRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and others) and persists in the absence of p53 and under hypoxic conditions. The regulation of autophagy and de novo lipogenesis by SR9009 and SR9011 has a critical role in evoking an apoptotic response in malignant cells. Notably, the selective anticancer properties of these REV-ERB agonists impair glioblastoma growth in vivo and improve survival without causing overt toxicity in mice. These results indicate that pharmacological modulation of circadian regulators is an effective antitumour strategy, identifying a class of anticancer agents with a wide therapeutic window. We propose that REV-ERB agonists are inhibitors of autophagy and de novo lipogenesis, with selective activity towards malignant and benign neoplasms.},

	abstract = {We have previously demonstrated that olanzapine-induced desensitization of 5-HT2A receptor-stimulated phospholipase C (PLC) activity is associated with increases in RGS7 protein levels both in vivo and in cells in culture, and the increase in RGS7 is dependent on activation of the JAK-STAT pathway in cells in culture. In the present study, we found that desensitization of 5-HT2A receptor-stimulated PLC activity induced by olanzapine is dependent on activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. Similar to olanzapine, clozapine-induced desensitization of 5-HT2A receptor signalling is accompanied by increases in RGS7 and activation of JAK2. Treatment with the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist MDL 100907 also increased RGS7 protein levels and JAK2 activation. Using a JAK2 inhibitor AG490, we found that clozapine and MDL 100907-induced increases in RGS7 are dependent on activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. Olanzapine, clozapine, and MDL 100907 treatment increased mRNA levels of RGS7. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay we found STAT3 binding to the putative RGS7 promoter region. Taken together, olanzapine-induced activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, and STAT3 binding to the RGS7 gene could underlie the increase in RGS7 mRNA which could subsequently increase protein expression. Furthermore, the increase in RGS7 protein could play a role in the desensitization of 5-HT2A receptor signalling by terminating the activated Galphaq/11 proteins more rapidly. Overall, our data suggest that the complete desensitization of 5-HT2A receptor-stimulated PLC activity by olanzapine, clozapine and MDL 100907 requires activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, which in turn increases RGS7 expression probably by direct transcriptional activity of STAT3.},

Though dopaminergic dysregulation characterizes a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and addiction, there has been relatively little investigation into the nature of relationships across dopamine markers within healthy individuals. Here we used PET imaging in 40 healthy adults to compare, within individuals, the estimates of dopamine synthesis capacity (Ki) using 6-[18F]fluoro-l-m-tyrosine ([18F]FMT; a substrate for aromatic amino acid decarboxylase), baseline D2/3 receptor-binding potential using [11C]raclopride (a weak competitive D2/3 receptor antagonist), and dopamine release using [11C]raclopride paired with oral methylphenidate administration. Methylphenidate increases synaptic dopamine by blocking the dopamine transporter. We estimated dopamine release by contrasting baseline D2/3 receptor binding and D2/3 receptor binding following methylphenidate. Analysis of relationships among the three measurements within striatal regions of interest revealed a positive correlation between [18F]FMT Ki and the baseline (placebo) [11C]raclopride measure, such that participants with greater synthesis capacity showed higher D2/3 receptor-binding potential. In contrast, there was no relationship between [18F]FMT and methylphenidate-induced [11C]raclopride displacement. These findings shed light on the nature of regulation between pre- and postsynaptic dopamine function in healthy adults, which may serve as a template from which to identify and describe alteration with disease.},

	abstract = {Whereas cortical GAD67 reduction and subsequent GABA level decrease are consistently observed in schizophrenia and depression, it remains unclear how these GABAergic abnormalities contribute to specific symptoms. We modeled cortical GAD67 reduction in mice, in which the Gad1 gene is genetically ablated from {\textasciitilde}50\% of cortical and hippocampal interneurons. Mutant mice showed a reduction of tissue GABA in the hippocampus and cortex including mPFC, and exhibited a cluster of effort-based behavior deficits including decreased home-cage wheel running and increased immobility in both tail suspension and forced swim tests. Since saccharine preference, progressive ratio responding to food, and learned helplessness task were normal, such avolition-like behavior could not be explained by anhedonia or behavioral despair. In line with the prevailing view that dopamine in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a role in evaluating effort cost for engaging in actions, we found that tail-suspension triggered dopamine release in ACC of controls, which was severely attenuated in the mutant mice. Conversely, ACC dopamine release by progressive ratio responding to reward, during which animals were allowed to effortlessly perform the nose-poking, was not affected in mutants. These results suggest that cortical GABA reduction preferentially impairs the effort-based behavior which requires much effort with little benefit, through a deficit of ACC dopamine release triggered by high-effort cost behavior, but not by reward-seeking behavior. Collectively, a subset of negative symptoms with a reduced willingness to expend costly effort, often observed in patients with schizophrenia and depression, may be attributed to cortical GABA level reduction.},

However, a few studies have shown that the H1-antagonist fexofenadine produces mild stimulating effects. One hypothesis suggests that this is due to fexofenadine producing an increase in dopamine levels by blocking the dopamine transporter.ObjectiveIn this study, it was investigated whether a high dose of fexofenadine blocks the dopamine transporter in the striatum. In addition, the effect of fexofenadine on cognitive performance and motor impulsivity was investigated.MethodsSixteen healthy subjects were given either placebo or fexofenadine 360 mg. The binding potential of N-w-fluoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-[4-iodophenyl] nortropane ([123I]FP-CIT) was measured using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Cognitive performance was measured in 40 subjects (20 placebo, 20 fexofenadine) using a digit symbol substitution test (DSST) and a stop signal task. In addition, subjective and physiological effects of fexofenadine were observed.ResultsThe SPECT data demonstrated that there was no difference in the binding potential of FP-CIT at the dopamine transporter in the striatum between the placebo- and fexofenadine-treated subjects. The behavioral results showed that fexofenadine improved performance on the DSST at T max of the drug. Fexofenadine did not affect motor impulsivity, subjective experience, or physiological measures.ConclusionNo evidence was provided to support the hypothesis that fexofenadine stimulates performance by blocking the dopamine transporter. The behavioral data suggest that a high dose of fexofenadine can stimulate performance in cognitive tasks.},

Effect of theanine on brain amino acids and monoamines, and the striatal release of dopamine (DA) was investigated. Determination of amino acids in the brain after the intragastric administration of theanine showed that theanine was incorporated into brain through blood-brain barrier via leucine-preferring transport system. The concentrations of norepinephrine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5HIAA) in the brain regions were unaffected by the theanine administration except in striatum. Theanine administration caused significant increases in serotonin and/or DA concentrations in the brain, especially in striatum, hypothalamus and hippocampus. Direct administration of theanine into brain striatum by microinjection caused a significant increase of DA release in a dose-dependent manner. Microdialysis of brain with calcium-free Ringer buffer attenuated the theanine-induced DA release. Pretreatment with the Ringer buffer containing an antagonist of non-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) glutamate receptor, MK-801, for 1 hr did not change the significant increase of DA release induced by theanine. However, in the case of pretreatment with AP-5, (Â±)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid; antagonist of NMDA glutamate receptor, the theanine-induced DA release from striatum was significantly inhibited. These results suggest that theanine might affect the metabolism and/or the release of some neurotransmitters in the brain, such as DA.},

Studies, with selective irreversible inhibitors of MAO, showed that hordenine was a highly selective substrate for MAO-B of liver and that it was not deaminated by the MAO-A of intestinal epithelium. In contrast to tyramine, hordenine did not produce contractions of isolated vasa deferentia. However, 25 microM hordenine potentiated contractile responses of vasa, from control animals, to submaximal doses of noradrenaline and inhibited responses to tyramine. It did not alter responses, to noradrenaline, of vasa denervated by chronic pretreatment of rats with guanethidine. Therefore, it appears that hordenine acted as an inhibitor of noradrenaline uptake, in isolated vasa deferentia. These results indicate that dietary-hordenine is unlikely to be deaminated by intestinal MAO as this is predominantly MAO-A. Consequently, it is likely to be absorbed and could affect the sympathetic nervous system, by virtue of its action as an inhibitor of noradrenaline uptake.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The response to exogenous epinephrine (Ep) is difficult to predict given the multitude of factors involved such as broad pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic between-subject variabilities, which may be more pronounced in children. We investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Ep, co-administered with milrinone, in children who underwent open heart surgical repair for congenital defects following cardiopulmonary bypass, including associated variability factors.

Methods
Thirty-nine children with a high risk of low cardiac output syndrome were prospectively enrolled. Ep pharmacokinetics, hemodynamic and metabolic effects were analyzed using the non-linear mixed effects modeling software MONOLIX. According to the final model, an Ep dosing simulation was suggested.

Results
Ep dosing infusions ranged from 0.01 to 0.23 μg.kg-1.min-1 in children whose weight ranged from 2.5 to 58 kg. A one-compartment open model with linear elimination adequately described the Ep concentration-time courses. Bodyweight (BW) was the main covariate influencing clearance (CL) and endogenous Ep production rate (q0) via an allometric relationship: CL(BWi) = θCL x (BWi)3/4 and q0(BWi) = θq0 x (BWi )3/4. The increase in heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) as a function of Ep concentration were well described using an Emax model. The effect of age was significant on HR and MAP basal level parameters. Assuming that Ep stimulated the production rate of plasma glucose, the increases in plasma glucose and lactate levels were well described by turnover models without any significant effect of age, BW or exogenous glucose supply.

Conclusions
According to this population analysis, the developmental effects of BW and age explained a part of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics between-subject variabilities of Ep administration in critically ill children. This approach ultimately leads to a valuable Ep dosing simulation which should help clinicians to determine an appropriate a priori dosing regimen.},

In the present study, we characterized antidepressant-like effects of p-synephrine stereoisomers in both in vivo and in vitro systems. In the tail suspension test, S-(+)-p-synephrine (3 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced the duration of immobility, while R-(-)-p-synephrine (0.3-3 mg/kg, p.o.) had no effect. S-(+)-p-synephrine (0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg, p.o.) and R-(-)-p-synephrine (1 mg/ kg and 3 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reversed the reserpine (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced hypothermia.

In contrast, R-(-)-p-synephrine was more effective than S-(+)-p-synephrine in stimulation of [3H]noradrenaline release from rat cerebral cortical slices (maximal stimulation 23.9 +/- 1.8\% vs. 20.1 +/- 1.7\%; EC50 8.2 +/- 0.6 microM vs. EC50 12.3 +/- 0.9 microM). The stimulatory effect of R-(-)-p-synephrine on [3H]noradrenaline release was inhibited by nisoxetine (100 nM), but tetrodotoxin (1 microM) and elimination of extracellular calcium had no effect. It is suggested that S-(+)-p-synephrine has more effective antidepressant-like activity than R-(-)-p-synephrine.},

By using crude synaptosome preparations of hypothalamus and striatum incubated with low substrate concentrations of 14C-serotonin (1 X 10(-7) M), 14C-noradrenaline (2.5 X 10(-7) M) and 14C-dopamine (2.5 X 10(-7) M) in the absence and presence of selective amine uptake inhibitors (alaproclate, maprotiline and amfonelic acid, respectively), it was possible to determine the deaminating activities inside and outside the specific aminergic synaptosomes. Thus, with this technique the protection of MAO by the reversible inhibitors administered orally 1 h prior to the subcutaneous injection of phenelzine against the phenelzine effect could be determined inside and outside the specific aminergic neurons. It was found that alpha-ethyltryptamine, 4-methoxyamphetamine and particularly amiflamine and FLA 788(+) were more potent inside than outside the serotonergic neurons. FLA 668(+) was a selective inhibitor of noradrenergic MAO, to which also 4-methoxyamphetamine, amiflamine and FLA 788(+), but not alpha-ethyltryptamine had some preference. Harmaline had no certain preference for MAO in any of the aminergic neurons. At high doses of FLA 668(+) a preference for dopaminergic MAO was observed. Since pretreatment of the rats with norzimeldine or desipramine antagonized the preferences for serotonergic or noradrenergic MAO, it is plausible to conclude that the compounds showing these preferences are accumulated in the neurons by the membranal uptake systems.},

Apathy was assessed using Apathy Evaluation Scale. Discontinuation of carbamazepine did not alleviate apathy. Aripiprazole, a novel antipsychotic with partial agonistic activity at dopamine D2 receptors, was introduced and the dose adjusted to 15mg a day. The patient showed significant improvement in apathy after six weeks of therapy with aripiprazole., Discussion: Depression is often mistaken for apathy, which is different in symptoms, presentation, and treatment options. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are known to cause or increase symptoms of apathy in some patients. Recent evidence suggests that dopamine receptor agonists can be helpful in treatment of apathy. Apathy significantly improved in this patient after initiation of aripiprazole., Conclusion: Aripiprazole may be useful for treatment of apathy syndrome. Its role in treatment of apathy requires further investigation in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {The serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) receptor is a potential therapeutic target to a host of neuropsychiatric conditions, but agonist actions at this site are linked to abuse-related hallucinogenic effects that may limit therapeutic efficacy of chronic drug administration. Tolerance to some effects of hallucinogens has been observed in humans and laboratory animals, but the understanding of tolerance and cross-tolerance between distinct structural classes of hallucinogens is limited. Here, we used the drug-elicited head twitch response (HTR) in mice to assess the development of tolerance and cross-tolerance with two phenethylamine-derived [DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine) and 2C-T-7 (2,5-dimethoxy-4-propylthiophenethylamine)] and two tryptamine-derived [DPT (N,N-dipropyltryptamine) and DIPT (N,N-diisopropyltryptamine)] drugs with agonist affinity for 5-HT2A receptors. Tolerance developed to HTR elicited by daily DOI or 2C-T-7, but not to HTR elicited by DPT or DIPT. DOI-elicited tolerance was not surmountable with dose, and a similar insurmountable cross-tolerance was evident when DOI-tolerant mice were tested with various doses of 2C-T-7 or DPT. These studies suggest that the use of phenethylamine-derived hallucinogens as therapeutic agents may be limited not only by their abuse potential, but also by the rapid development of tolerance that would likely be maintained even if a patient were switched to a different 5-HT2A agonist medication from a distinct structural class. However, these experiments also imply that tryptamine-derived hallucinogens might have a reduced potential for tolerance development, compared with phenethylamine-derived 5-HT2A agonists, and might therefore be more suitable for chronic administration in a therapeutic context.},

Adult male rhesus monkeys (N = 6) responded in the morning on tasks designed to assess different cognitive domains using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) touchscreens followed by responding maintained under a fixed-ratio (FR) 10 schedule of food presentation in different operant chambers. First, the acute effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 0.01–0.56 mg/kg, i.v.) on cognitive performance, FR responding, and body temperature were determined. Next, THC (1.0–2.0 mg/kg, s.c.) was administered daily after FR 10 sessions for 12 weeks, during which the residual effects of THC (i.e., 22 hours after administration) on cognition were examined and the acute effects of THC were redetermined. In a subgroup of monkeys, dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability was assessed after 4 weeks of chronic THC exposure and compared with drug-naive controls using positron emission tomography and [11C]-raclopride (N = 4/group). Acute THC pretreatments dose-dependently decreased FR responding and body temperature, and impairment to cognitive performance was task specific. During chronic treatment, THC produced persistent residual impairment only to working memory; tolerance differentially developed to acute cognitive impairments. There was recovery from residual cognitive impairments to working memory within 2 weeks of abstinence. Compared with controls, D2/D3 receptor availability was not altered during chronic THC treatment. In conclusion, THC-induced disruptions in cognition were task-specific, as was tolerance development, and not related to changes in D2/D3 receptor availability. Intervention strategies for cannabis-use disorder that enhance working memory performance may facilitate positive treatment outcomes.},

However, an M1R-selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM), benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA), at 30 mg/kg, induced diarrhea in wild-type mice, but not in M1R knockout mice. Moreover, BQCA (0.1–1000 nM) augmented electric field stimulation (EFS)-induced ileum contraction in an in vitro Magnus assay. Thus, we decided to establish a drug-screening strategy to discover novel M1 PAMs producing potent cognitive improvement with minimized gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. We assessed PAM parameters of various M1 PAMs with ≥100-fold selectivity over other muscarinic receptor subtypes by using in vitro binding and functional analysis. Evaluation of these M1 PAMs in the Magnus assay revealed a significant correlation between percentage of ileum contractions at 1 μM and their α-value, a PAM parameter associated with the binding cooperativity between acetylcholine and M1 PAM. M1 PAMs with lower α-value showed lower impact on EFS-induced ileum contraction. Next, we characterized in vivo profiles of two M1 PAMs: compound A (log α = 1.18) and compound B (log α = 3.30). Compound A, at 30 mg/kg, significantly improved scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits without prominent signs of diarrhea at up to 1000 mg/kg in mice. In contrast, compound B, at 10 mg/kg, showed both significant improvement of scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits and severe diarrhea. Thus, fine adjustment of the α-values could be a key to discovering M1 PAMs yielding potent cognitive improvement with a lower risk of GI effects.},

Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may decrease sleep latency but could impair sleep quality long-term. Novel studies investigating cannabinoids and obstructive sleep apnea suggest that synthetic cannabinoids such as nabilone and dronabinol may have short-term benefit for sleep apnea due to their modulatory effects on serotonin-mediated apneas. CBD may hold promise for REM sleep behavior disorder and excessive daytime sleepiness, while nabilone may reduce nightmares associated with PTSD and may improve sleep among patients with chronic pain.SummaryResearch on cannabis and sleep is in its infancy and has yielded mixed results. Additional controlled and longitudinal research is critical to advance our understanding of research and clinical implications.},

By examining bioenergetic changes induced by glutamate, we found that the cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) level is a critical determinant of neuronal survival. The bioenergetic effects of mitochondrial uncoupling and caloric restriction were also examined in cultured neurons and rodent brain. 2, 4-dinitrophenol (DNP) is a chemical mitochondrial uncoupler that stimulates glucose uptake and oxygen consumption on cultured neurons, which accelerates oxidation of NAD(P)H to NAD+ in mitochondria. The NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase sirtulin 1 (SIRT1) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) mRNA are upregulated mouse brain under caloric restriction. To examine whether NAD+ mediates neuroprotective effects, nicotinamide, a precursor of NAD+ and inhibitor of SIRT1 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) (two NAD+-dependent enzymes), was employed. Nicotinamide attenuated excitotoxic death and preserved cellular NAD+ levels to support SIRT1 and PARP 1 activities. Our findings suggest that mild mitochondrial uncoupling and caloric restriction exert hormetic effects by stimulating bioenergetics in neurons thereby increasing tolerance of neurons to metabolic stress.},

As the above enzymes take part in degradation of not only enkephalins but also other regulatory peptides, it can be assumed that one of the mechanisms of biological activity of Semax and Selank is related to this inhibitory activity of theirs.},

Design Case-control study.
Setting General practices in the UK contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.
Participants 40 770 patients aged 65-99 with a diagnosis of dementia between April 2006 and July 2015, and 283 933 controls without dementia.
Interventions Daily defined doses of anticholinergic drugs coded using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale, in total and grouped by subclass, prescribed 4-20 years before a diagnosis of dementia.
Main outcome measures Odds ratios for incident dementia, adjusted for a range of demographic and health related covariates.
Results 14 453 (35\%) cases and 86 403 (30\%) controls were prescribed at least one anticholinergic drug with an ACB score of 3 (definite anticholinergic activity) during the exposure period. The adjusted odds ratio for any anticholinergic drug with an ACB score of 3 was 1.11 (95\% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.14). Dementia was associated with an increasing average ACB score. When considered by drug class, gastrointestinal drugs with an ACB score of 3 were not distinctively linked to dementia. The risk of dementia increased with greater exposure for antidepressant, urological, and antiparkinson drugs with an ACB score of 3. This result was also observed for exposure 15-20 years before a diagnosis.
Conclusions A robust association between some classes of anticholinergic drugs and future dementia incidence was observed. This could be caused by a class specific effect, or by drugs being used for very early symptoms of dementia. Future research should examine anticholinergic drug classes as opposed to anticholinergic effects intrinsically or summing scales for anticholinergic exposure.

	volume = {23},
	issn = {1671-4083},
	abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of pentadecapeptide BPC 157 on chronic exposure to amphetamine in rats, particularly the changes commonly referred in chronic amphetamine studies as tolerance (lesser grade of stereotyped behavior, without increased excitability) and reverse tolerance (ie, prominent stereotyped behavior and heightened startle response upon late amphetamine challenges).
METHODS: After initial application (initial single dose-regimen), amphetamine (10 mg/kg,ip) was given once daily till d 5 (continuous administration-regimen), and thereafter on d 8, 16, and 46 (intermittent administration regimen). Fo r stereotyped behavior and heightened startle response the observation period was 120 min after amphetamine application, and each animal was observed for 10 s in 5 min intervals. Pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (10 microg/kg or 10 ng/k g, ip) or saline (5.0 mL/kg, ip) were given only at the beginning of the experiment, simultaneously with the initial dose of amphetamine.
RESULTS: In relation to applied initial-single/continuous/intermittent amphetamine applications regimen, the control amphetamine rats throughout the experiment showed the changes in stereotyped behavior and heightened startle response, increment or decrement, commonly explained in chronic amphetamine studies as tolerance and reverse tolerance. After t he initial application of the amphetamine, the higher BPC 157 dosage apparently attenuated the stereotyped behavior, while the lower dosage of BPC 157 did not reach a statistical significance. Considering the forthcoming amphetamine challenges, in the rats initially treated with pentadecapeptide BPC 157, either 10 microg- or 10 ng-dose, at the time of the first application of amphetamine, the stereotyped behavior remains to be attenuated after all additional amphetamine challenges (on d 2-5, 8, 16, and 46). This attenuation was not limited to stereotyped behavior only. After the initial application of the amphetamine the heighten ed startle response was also apparently mitigated in rats receiving the BPC 157 dosage, either higher or lower. Later, confronted with the forthcoming amphetamine challenges, they showed apparently less abnormal excitability at all tested points.
CONCLUSION: In summary, gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (ie, both microg- and ng-BPC 157 regimens) attenuated chronic amphetamine disturbances. This effect was present throughout the observation period at a statistically significant level. Therefore, it seems that this gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 has a modulatory effect on dopamine system, and it could be used in chronic amphetamine disturbances.},

This manuscript is a reference work on the receptor affinity pharmacology of psychedelic drugs. New data is presented on the affinity of twenty-five psychedelic drugs at fifty-one receptors, transporters, and ion channels, assayed by the National Institute of Mental Health â€“ Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (NIMH-PDSP). In addition, comparable data gathered from the literature on ten additional drugs is also presented (mostly assayed by the NIMH-PDSP). A new method is introduced for normalizing affinity (Ki) data that factors out potency so that the multi-receptor affinity profiles of different drugs can be directly compared and contrasted. The method is then used to compare the thirty-five drugs in graphical and tabular form. It is shown that psychedelic drugs, especially phenylalkylamines, are not as selective as generally believed, interacting with forty-two of forty-nine broadly assayed sites. The thirty-five drugs of the study have very diverse patterns of interaction with different classes of receptors, emphasizing eighteen different receptors. This diversity of receptor interaction may underlie the qualitative diversity of these drugs. It should be possible to use this diverse set of drugs as probes into the roles played by the various receptor systems in the human mind.},

	abstract = {Extinguishing memories to fight addiction
Relapse in cocaine addicts can be prevented by training addicts not to respond to drug-associated cues. This process is called extinction learning in animal models of drug addiction. Activation of the β-adrenergic receptor, which can preferentially stimulate signaling mediated by β-arrestins or G proteins, is implicated in extinction learning. Huang et al. determined that the β-arrestin–dependent pathway was required downstream of β-adrenergic receptor activation to promote extinction learning in two different models, including a self-administration paradigm. Specifically, β-arrestin signaling was required in excitatory neurons in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex, a region of the brain involved in attenuating the association between drugs and cues. Thus, enhancing β-arrestin signaling in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex may augment the effect of cognitive therapy in preventing drug-seeking behavior and relapse in cocaine addicts.
Extinction learning of cocaine-associated contextual cues can help prevent cocaine addicts from relapsing. Pharmacological manipulation of β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) during extinction learning is being developed as a potential strategy to treat drug addiction. We demonstrated that the extinction learning of cocaine-associated memory was mediated by β-arrestin2–biased but not heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–dependent β-adrenergic signaling. We found that administration of the nonbiased β-AR antagonist propranolol, but not the G protein–biased β-AR antagonist carvedilol, blocked extinction learning of cocaine-conditioned place preference and the associated ERK activation in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex. Overexpression of β-arrestin2 in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex promoted extinction learning, which was blocked by propranolol. Knockout of β-arrestin2 in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex, specifically in excitatory neurons, impaired extinction learning of cocaine-conditioned place preference, which was not rescued by carvedilol. β-Arrestin2 signaling in infralimbic excitatory neurons was also required for the extinction learning in the cocaine self-administration model. Our results suggest that β-arrestin–biased β-adrenergic signaling in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex regulates extinction learning of cocaine-associated memories and could be therapeutically targeted to treat addiction.
Enhancing the activity of the β-arrestin arm of β-adrenergic signaling may help to prevent relapse in cocaine addicts.

In the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS)' completed Phase 2 trials with 107 participants, 61\% no longer qualified for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after three sessions of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy two months following treatment. At the 12-month follow-up, 68\% no longer had PTSD. All participants had chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD.

MAPS is a non-profit research and educational organization working to develop contexts for careful, beneficial uses of psychedelics and marijuana.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to MDMA for the treatment of PTSD. MAPS and the FDA have also reached agreement under the Special Protocol Assessment Process (SPA) for the design of two upcoming Phase 3 trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for patients with severe PTSD.

Despite increased interest in cannabisâ€™ potential medical uses, research barriers, cannabis legislation, stigma, and lack of dissemination of data contribute to low adoption for some medical populations. Of interest, cannabis use appears low in palliative care settings, with few guidelines available to palliative care providers. The present study sought to examine the attitudes, beliefs, and practices of palliative care providers regarding the use of cannabis for terminally ill patients. Palliative care providers (N = 426) completed a one-time online survey assessing these attitudes, beliefs, and practices. Results demonstrated that palliative care providers endorse cannabis for a wide range of palliative care symptoms, end-of-life care generally, and as an adjuvant medication. Nevertheless, the gap between these beliefs and actual recommendation or prescription appears vast. Many who support the use of cannabis in palliative care do not recommend it as a treatment.

	abstract = {Aspirin is a cornerstone in the antiplatelet therapy for acute coronary syndromes. Coadministration of morphine may potentially influence the intestinal absorption, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics, as seen with P2Y12 inhibitors. In this trial, healthy volunteers were randomized to receive morphine (5 mg, i.v. bolus injection) at one of seven different time points before, after, or with aspirin (162 mg, p.o.) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion. After a 14-day washout, subjects received placebo instead of morphine. Pharmacokinetics were determined by liquid chromatography, and aspirin’s effects were measured by platelet function tests (whole-blood platelet aggregation: multiplate, platelet plug formation: PFA-100). Morphine increased the total acetylsalicylic acid exposure by 20\% compared with placebo when given simultaneously with aspirin, whereas Cmax and tmax were not altered. Morphine had no significant effect on aspirin-induced platelet inhibition. In contrast to coadministration with P2Y12 inhibitors, morphine appears to have negligible interaction with aspirin.},

	abstract = {Purpose/Background Personalized (N-of-1) trials are single-patient, crossover-design trials that may be useful for personalizing the selection of depression treatments. We conducted a systematic review of published N-of-1 trials for depression to determine the feasibility and suitability of this methodology for personalizing depression care.
        Methods/Procedures Electronic databases were searched from database inception through October 2016. Studies were selected if they enrolled depressed patients, included a within-subject crossover design, and systematically assessed depressive symptoms during the N-of-1 trial.
        Findings/Results Five eligible studies reporting on 47 depressed patients (range, 1–18 patients) were identified. Two studies were conducted among adults with treatment-resistant depression, 1 study among depressed inpatients, and 2 studies among patients from special populations (geriatric nursing home, human immunodeficiency virus–associated encephalopathy). All studies evaluated the effects of pharmacologic treatments (methylphenidate, D-amphetamine, ketamine, and sulpiride). Three studies compared an off-label treatment with placebo, 1 study compared 2 off-label treatments, and 1 study compared escalating doses of an off-label treatment with placebo. All 4 studies with more than 1 participant demonstrated heterogeneous treatment effects. All studies produced data that could personalize treatment selection for individual patients. No studies reported on recruitment challenges, compliance with self-tracking, or satisfaction with participation.
        Implications/Conclusions The feasibility of N-of-1 trials for depression was demonstrated for a limited number of second-line pharmacologic treatments in treatment-resistant patients or in patients with comorbidities that would have excluded them from conventional randomized controlled trials. Additional research is needed to determine whether N-of-1 trials are suitable for improving the selection of depression treatments in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Purpose The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) has a variety of physiological functions in maternal behavior and attachment including sexual behavior. Based on animal research and our previous human studies, we set out to investigate intranasal administration of OXT and hypothesized that OXT should be able to modulate sexual function in women.
        Methods In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover laboratory setting, the acute effects of intranasal administered OXT (24 international units) on sexual drive, arousal, orgasm, and refractory aspects of sexual behavior were analyzed in 27 healthy females (mean age ± SD, 27.52 ± 8.04) together with physiological parameters using vaginal photoplethysmography.
        Findings Oxytocin administration showed no effect on subjective sexual parameters (eg, postorgasmic tension; P = 0.051). Physiological parameters (vaginal photoplethysmography amplitude and vaginal blood volume) showed a response pattern towards sexual arousal but were not affected by OXT.
        Implications Using a well-established laboratory paradigm, we did not find that intranasal OXT influences female sexual parameters. Also, sexual drive and other functions were not affected by OXT. These findings indicate that OXT is not able to significantly increase subjective and objective parameters of sexual function in a setting with high internal validity; however, this might be different in a more naturalistic setting.},

	abstract = {Background- Pharmacological neuroenhancement (PN) is defined as the use of illicit or prescription drugs by healthy individuals for cognitive-enhancing purposes. The present study aimed i) to investigate whether including caffeine tablets in the definition of PN within a questionnaire increases the PN prevalence estimate (framing effect), ii) to investigate whether the health-related risk attitude is increased in students who use PN. Material and methods- Two versions of a paper-and-pencil questionnaire (first version included caffeine tablets in the definition of PN, the second excluded caffeine tablets) were distributed among university students at the University of Graz, Austria. The Unrelated Question Model (UQM) was used to estimate the 12-month PN prevalence and the German version of the 30-item Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) scale to assess the health-related risk attitude. Moreover, large-sample z-tests (Î± = 0.05) were performed for comparing the PN prevalence estimates of two groups. Results- 2,489 questionnaires were distributed and 2,284 (91.8\%) questionnaires were included in analysis. The overall PN prevalence estimate for all students was 11.9\%. One-tailed large-sample z-tests revealed that the PN estimate for students with higher health-related risk attitude was significantly higher compared to students with lower health-related risk attitude (15.6 vs. 8.5\%; z = 2.65, p = .004). Furthermore, when caffeine tablets were included into the example of PN, the prevalence estimate of PN was significantly higher compared to the version without caffeine tablets (14.9 vs. 9.0\%; z = 2.20, p = .014). Discussion- This study revealed that the PN prevalence estimate increases when caffeine tablets are included in the definition of PN. Therefore, future studies investigating the prevalence of, and predictors for, PN should be performed and interpreted with respect to potential framing effects. This study further revealed that the PN prevalence estimate is increased in students with a higher health-related risk attitude compared to students with a lower one. Therefore, future education and prevention programs addressing PN in the collective of students should not only inform about potential side effects of its use but also address the limited effects on cognition and potential alternatives of PN.},

	abstract = {A feature of human culture is that we can learn to consume chemical compounds, derived from natural plants or synthetic fabrication, for their psychoactive effects. These drugs change the mental state and/or the behavioral performance of an individual and can be instrumentalized for various purposes. After the emergence of a novel psychoactive substance (NPS) and a period of experimental consumption, personal and medical benefits and harm potential of the NPS can be estimated on evidence base. This may lead to a legal classification of the NPS, which may range from limited medical use, controlled availability up to a complete ban of the drug form publically accepted use. With these measures, however, a drug does not disappear, but frequently continues to be used, which eventually allows an even better estimate of the drug’s properties. Thus, only in rare cases, there is a final verdict that is no more questioned. Instead, the view on a drug can change from tolerable to harmful but may also involve the new establishment of a desired medical application to a previously harmful drug.

On the other hand, a decrease in DA, DOPAC, and HVA tissue contents suggests possible adaptive changes in DA turnover or damage of DA terminals by 5-MeO-DIPT. DNA single and double-strand breaks persisted up to 60 days after the treatment, indicating marked neurotoxicity of 5-MeO-DIPT. The induction of head-twitch response and potentiation of forepaw treading induced by 8-OH-DPAT indicate that hallucinogenic activity seems to be mediated through the stimulation of 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors by 5-MeO-DIPT.},

In the present study we present evidence that serotonergic agents possessing 5HT2A agonist activity prevent NMDA antagonist neurotoxicity in rat brain. It is proposed that 5HT2A agonists may also prevent the psychotomimetic effects of NMDA antagonists. Among the 5HT2A agonists examined and found to be neuroprotective are LSD and related hallucinogens. The apparent contradiction in proposing that these agents might have antipsychotic properties is resolved by evidence linking their hallucinogenic activity to agonist action at 5HT2C receptors, whereas antipsychotic activity would be attributable to agonist action at 5HT2A receptors.},

	abstract = {Until now, more than 800 distinct G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been identified in the human genome. The four subtypes of the adenosine receptor (A1, A2A, A2B and A3 receptor) belong to this large family of GPCRs that represent the most widely targeted pharmacological protein class. Since adenosine receptors are widespread throughout the body and involved in a variety of physiological processes and diseases, there is great interest in understanding how the different subtypes are regulated, as a basis for designing therapeutic drugs that either avoid or make use of this regulation. The major GPCR regulatory pathway involves phosphorylation of activated receptors by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), a process that is followed by binding of arrestin proteins. This prevents receptors from activating downstream heterotrimeric G protein pathways, but at the same time allows activation of arrestin-dependent signalling pathways. Upon agonist treatment, adenosine receptor subtypes are differently regulated. For instance, the A1Rs are not (readily) phosphorylated and internalize slowly, showing a typical half-life of several hours, whereas the A2AR and A2BR undergo much faster downregulation, usually shorter than 1Â h. The A3R is subject to even faster downregulation, often a matter of minutes. The fast desensitization of the A3R after agonist exposure may be therapeutically equivalent to antagonist occupancy of the receptor. This review describes the process of desensitization and internalization of the different adenosine subtypes in cell systems, tissues and in vivo studies. In addition, molecular mechanisms involved in adenosine receptor desensitization are discussed.},

This was accomplished by using a method of progressively altering dose ("fading"). Dose-response tests revealed that the three LSD cues were specific to the dose used during training and that, as the training dose declined, the slope of the LSD dose-response curve became less steep. Substitution tests with direct serotonin (5-HT) agonists (quipazine, MK-212, 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) and antagonism tests with central 5-HT antagonists (methiothepin and cyproheptadine) indicated that 5-HT is involved in mediating the in vivo effects of LSD and that training dose co-determines (along with the dose of the test compound) the extent of substitution or antagonism. In addition, substitution tests with the peripherally-active 5-HT agonist 5-methoxytryptamine and 5-HT antagonist xylamidine suggested that the peripheral serotonergic actions of LSD may be involved (in part) in the low dose (0.02 mg/kg) LSD cue. In contrast to 5-HT, dopamine (DA) did not appear to be involved in the discriminative stimulus properties of LSD, because no significant dose or group effects were seen during tests with the DA agonists apomorphine and d-amphetamine or the DA antagonist haloperidol.},

The characteristic effects of the hallucinogens include suppression of locomotor and exploratory behavior and a preferential decrease in entries into the center of the BPM during the initial half of the test session. After LSD, the initial suppression of responding is followed by a subsequent increase in locomotor activity that is not observed with other serotonergic agonists. In the present studies, the 5HT-1 andβ-adrenergic antagonistd,1-propranolol and the 5HT-2 antagonist ritanserin were administered individually or in combination prior to the acute administration of LSD to test for the involvement of these receptor subtypes in the mediation of the effects of LSD in the BPM paradigm. Propranolol (20 mg/kg) abolished the initial suppression of activity induced by 60 µg/kg LSD without affecting the subsequent increase in locomotion. Conversely, 2.0 mg/kg ritanserin failed to block the initial suppressive effects of 60 or 120 µg/kg LSD, but attenuated the LSD-induced increases in activity during the second half of the session. The combination of propranolol and ritanserin prevented both these effects of LSD. By contrast, the more selective 5HT-2 agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) (0.27 mg/kg) produced an initial suppression of activity in the BPM that was blocked by 2.0 mg/kg ritanserin and was not followed by a subsequent increase in activity. These findings suggest that the initial suppressive effects of LSD in the BPM paradigm are dissociable from the subsequent increases in locomotion and that the two effects are mediated via different serotonergic orβ-adrenergic receptors.},

	abstract = {Rationale
The head-twitch response (HTR) is a rapid side-to-side rotational head movement that occurs in rats and mice after administration of serotonergic hallucinogens and other 5-HT2A agonists. The HTR is widely used as a behavioral assay for 5-HT2A activation and to probe for interactions between the 5-HT2A receptor and other transmitter systems.

Objective
High-speed video recordings were used to analyze the head movement that occurs during head twitches in C57BL/6J mice. Experiments were also conducted in C57BL/6J mice to determine whether a head-mounted magnet and a magnetometer coil could be used to detect the HTR induced by serotonergic hallucinations based on the dynamics of the response.

Results
Head movement during the HTR was highly rhythmic and occurred within a specific frequency range (mean reciprocation frequency of 90.3 Hz). Head twitches produced wave-like oscillations of magnetometer coil voltage that matched the frequency of head movement during the response. The magnetometer coil detected the HTR induced by the serotonergic hallucinogens 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI; 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg, IP) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg, IP) with extremely high sensitivity and specificity. Magnetometer coil recordings demonstrated that the non-hallucinogenic compounds (+)-amphetamine (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg, IP) and lisuride (0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 mg/kg, IP) did not induce the HTR.

Conclusions
These studies confirm that a magnetometer coil can be used to detect the HTR induced by hallucinogens. The use of magnetometer-based HTR detection provides a high-throughput, semi-automated assay for this behavior, and offers several advantages over traditional assessment methods.},

	abstract = {Psychedelics (serotonergic hallucinogens) are powerful psychoactive substances that alter perception and mood and affect numerous cognitive processes. They are generally considered physiologically safe and do not lead to dependence or addiction. Their origin predates written history, and they were employed by early cultures in many sociocultural and ritual contexts. After the virtually contemporaneous discovery of (5R,8R)-(+)-lysergic acid-N,N-diethylamide (LSD)-25 and the identification of serotonin in the brain, early research focused intensively on the possibility that LSD and other psychedelics had a serotonergic basis for their action. Today there is a consensus that psychedelics are agonists or partial agonists at brain serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors, with particular importance on those expressed on apical dendrites of neocortical pyramidal cells in layer V. Several useful rodent models have been developed over the years to help unravel the neurochemical correlates of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor activation in the brain, and a variety of imaging techniques have been employed to identify key brain areas that are directly affected by psychedelics. Recent and exciting developments in the field have occurred in clinical research, where several double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 studies of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in patients with cancer-related psychosocial distress have demonstrated unprecedented positive relief of anxiety and depression. Two small pilot studies of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy also have shown positive benefit in treating both alcohol and nicotine addiction. Recently, blood oxygen level–dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography have been employed for in vivo brain imaging in humans after administration of a psychedelic, and results indicate that intravenously administered psilocybin and LSD produce decreases in oscillatory power in areas of the brain’s default mode network.},

However, the relevance of these findings remains unclear due to limited knowledge about the ecstasy/MDMA use pattern of real-life users.Aims:We examined the representativeness of ecstasy users enrolled in neuroimaging studies by comparing their ecstasy use habits with the use patterns of a large, international sample.Methods:A systematic literature search revealed 10 imaging studies that compare serotonin transporter levels in recreational ecstasy users to matched controls. To characterize the ecstasy use patterns we relied on the Global Drug Survey, the world?s largest self-report database on drug use. The basis of the dose comparison were the Usual Amount (pills/session), Use Frequency (sessions/month) and Dose Intensity (pills/year) variables.Results:Both the average Usual Amount (pills/session) and Use Frequency (sessions/month) of neuroimaging study participants corresponded to the top 5?10\% of the Global Drug Survey sample and imaging participants, on average, consumed 720\% more pills over a year than the Global Drug Survey participants.Conclusions:Our findings suggest that the serotonin brain imaging literature has focused on unusually heavy ecstasy use and therefore the conclusions from these studies are likely to overestimate the extent of serotonergic alterations experienced by the majority of people who use ecstays.},

	abstract = {(R,S)-Ketamine has rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in depressed patients. Although the metabolism of (R,S)-ketamine to (2 R,6 R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK), a metabolite of (R)-ketamine, has been reported to be essential for its antidepressant effects, recent evidence suggests otherwise. The present study investigated the role of the metabolism of (R)-ketamine to (2 R,6 R)-HNK in the antidepressant actions of (R)-ketamine. Antidepressant effects were evaluated using the forced swimming test in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation model of mice and the tail suspension test in naive mice. To prevent the metabolism of (R)-ketamine to (2 R,6 R)-HNK, mice were pretreated with cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors. The concentrations of (R)-ketamine, (R)-norketamine, and (2 R,6 R)-HNK in plasma, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were determined using enantioselective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The concentrations of (R)-norketamine and (2 R,6 R)-HNK in plasma, brain, and CSF samples after administration of (R)-norketamine (10 mg/kg) and (2 R,6 R)-HNK (10 mg/kg), respectively, were higher than those generated after administration of (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg). Nonetheless, while (R)-ketamine attenuated, neither (R)-norketamine nor (2 R,6 R)-HNK significantly altered immobility times of LPS-treated mice. Treatment with CYP inhibitors prior to administration of (R)-ketamine increased the plasma levels of (R)-ketamine, while generation of (2 R,6 R)-HNK was almost completely blocked. (R)-Ketamine exerted the antidepressant effects at a lower dose in the presence of CYP inhibitors than in their absence, which is consistent with exposure levels of (R)-ketamine but not (2 R,6 R)-HNK. These results indicate that metabolism to (2 R,6 R)-HNK is not necessary for the antidepressant effects of (R)-ketamine and that unmetabolized (R)-ketamine itself may be responsible for its antidepressant actions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It remains debated whether anemia is associated with depression, independently of physical health factors. We report a large-scale cross-sectional study examining this association in adults free of chronic disease and medication from the general population.
METHOD: Hemoglobin levels were measured among 44 173 healthy participants [63\% men; mean [standard deviation] age = 38.4 (11.1) years] from the 'Investigations PrÃ©ventives et Cliniques' (IPC) cohort study. Depression was measured with the Questionnaire of Depression 2nd version, Abridged. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the association between anemia and depression, while adjusting for a wide range of sociodemographic characteristics and health-related factors (i.e., sex, age, living status, education level, occupational status, alcohol intake, smoking status, physical activity, and body mass index).
RESULTS: Depressed participants were significantly more likely to have anemia compared to non-depressed participants, even after adjustment for sociodemographic and health-related variables [odds ratio = 1.36; 95\% confidence interval = (1.18; 1.57)]. Anemia prevalence increased with depression severity, suggesting a dose-response relationship (P for trend {\textless}0.001).
CONCLUSION: In healthy adults from the general population, we found a significant and robust association between depression and anemia. Further studies are needed to assess the longitudinal relationship between both conditions and determine the mechanisms underlying this association.},

	abstract = {Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant with a unique mechanism of action and recently it has been also reported that its major metabolite, compound MC5, possesses pharmacological activity similar to that of the parent drug. The current study aims to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of both tianeptine and MC5 after intravenous or intraperitoneal administration of the parent drug as well as the metabolic ratio of MC5 in rats. To achieve these goals an LC-MS/MS method using the small sample volume for the quantitation of tianeptine and its active metabolite MC5 in rat plasma and liver perfusate has been developed and validated. Following an intravenous administration of tianeptine pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis. The average tianeptine volume of distribution at steady state was 2.03 L/kg and the systemic clearance equaled 1.84 L/h/kg. The mean elimination half-lives of tianeptine and MC5 metabolite were 1.16 and 7.53 h, respectively. The hepatic clearance of tianeptine determined in the isolated rat liver perfusion studies was similar to the perfusate flow rate despite the low metabolic ratio of MC5. Mass spectrometric analysis of rat bile indicated that tianeptine and MC5 metabolite are eliminated with bile as glucuronide and glutamine conjugates. Bioavailability of tianeptine after its intraperitoneal administration was 69\%. The PK model with a metabolite compartment developed in this study for both tianeptine and MC5 metabolite after two routes of administration may facilitate tianeptine dosage selection for the prospective pharmacological experiments.},

Continuous, natural speech production activates the right lateral temporal lobe in schizophrenia, as opposed to the left in healthy subjects. Positive and negative FTD can be elicited in healthy subjects by glutamatergic NMDA blockade with ketamine. It is unclear whether the glutamate system is related to the reversed hemispheric lateralization during speaking in patients. In a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study, 15 healthy, male, right-handed volunteers overtly described 7 pictures for 3 min each while BOLD signal changes were acquired with fMRI. As a measure of linguistic demand, the number of words within 20 s epochs was correlated with BOLD responses. Participants developed S-ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms, particularly positive FTD. Ketamine vs placebo was associated with enhanced neural responses in the right middle and inferior temporal gyri. Similar to a previous fMRI study in schizophrenia patients vs healthy controls applying the same design, S-ketamine reversed functional lateralization during speech production in healthy subjects. Results demonstrate an association between glutamatergic imbalance, dysactivations in lateral temporal brain areas, and FTD symptom formation.},

Furthermore, studies in preclinical models suggest that decreasing IL-6 activity may mitigate or reverse some of these deficits. The purpose of this trial was to test whether an IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, would improve residual positive and negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. We randomized 36 clinically stable, moderately symptomatic (i.e., Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) {\textgreater}60) individuals with schizophrenia to 3 monthly infusions of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo (normal saline). The primary outcome was effect at week 12 on the PANSS Total Score. Effects on the MATRICS, other PANSS subscales, Clinical Global Impression, and Global Assessment of Functioning were secondary outcomes. There were no observed treatment effects on any behavioral outcome measure. Baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) or cytokine levels did not predict treatment outcome, nor were there correlations between changes in these inflammatory markers and the measured outcomes. As expected, IL-6 and IL-8 increased, while CRP decreased, in the tocilizumab group compared with the placebo group. This study did not reveal any evidence that an IL-6 receptor antibody affects behavioral outcomes in schizophrenia. One potential explanation is the lack of capacity of this agent to penetrate the central nervous system. Additional trials of medications aimed at targeting cytokine overactivity that act directly on brain function and/or treatment in early-stage psychosis populations are needed.},

The less active 5-HTTLPR genotypes were nominally significantly associated with increased blushing propensity in patients with social anxiety disorder as compared to controls with an equidirectional trend for the less active 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 haplotypes. Even when statistically controlled for influence of depression, this association remained significant. In summary, the present pilot study suggests a potential role of functional serotonin transporter gene variation in blushing propensity warranting replication and encouraging genetic analyses of further intermediate phenotypes of social anxiety disorder.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Nutmeg [Myristica fragrans Houtt. (Myristicaceae)] has a long-standing reputation of psychoactivity. Anecdotal reports of nutmeg use as a cheap marijuana substitute, coupled to previous studies reporting a cannabimimetic-like action, suggest that nutmeg may interact with the endocannabinoid system.
OBJECTIVE: The study evaluates nutmeg fractions for binding capacity with various CNS receptors and their potential interaction with the endocannabinoid system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dichloromethane (DF) and ethyl acetate (EF) fractions were prepared from the methanol extract of powdered whole nutmeg. The HPLC-profiled fractions were assayed by the NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (PDSP) in a panel of CNS targets at a 10 μg/mL concentration. The fractions were also screened for fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibition, initially at a concentration of 500 μg/mL, then by concentration-dependent inhibition studies.
RESULTS: None of the tested fractions showed significant binding to CNS receptors included in the PDSP panel. However, both fractions exerted significant inhibition of the FAAH and MAGL enzymes. The DF fraction inhibited FAAH and MAGL enzymes at IC50 values of 21.06 ± 3.16 and 15.34 ± 1.61 μg/mL, respectively. Similarly, the EF fraction demonstrated FAAH and MAGL inhibition with IC50 values of 15.42 ± 3.09 and 11.37 ± 6.15 μg/mL, respectively.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The study provides the first piece of evidence that nutmeg interacts with the endocannabinoid system via inhibition of the endocannabinoid catabolizing enzymes. This mechanism provides insight into reported cannabis-like action as well as expands the potential therapeutic utility of nutmeg.},

	abstract = {Novel molecular targets are needed to develop new medications for the treatment of cocaine addiction. Here we investigated a role for glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors in the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, an animal model of relapse. We showed that peripheral administration of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 dose dependently reduced cocaine seeking in rats at doses that did not affect ad libitum food intake, meal patterns or body weight. We also demonstrated that systemic exendin-4 penetrated the brain where it putatively bound receptors on both neurons and astrocytes in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The effects of systemic exendin-4 on cocaine reinstatement were attenuated in rats pretreated with intra-VTA infusions of the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin-(9â€“39), indicating that the suppressive effects of systemic exendin-4 on cocaine seeking were due, in part, to activation of GLP-1 receptors in the VTA. Consistent with these effects, infusions of exendin-4 directly into the VTA reduced cocaine seeking. Finally, extinction following cocaine self-administration was associated with decreased preproglucagon mRNA expression in the caudal brainstem. Thus, our study demonstrated a novel role for GLP-1 receptors in the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior and identified behaviorally relevant doses of a GLP-1 receptor agonist that selectively reduced cocaine seeking and did not produce adverse effects.},
