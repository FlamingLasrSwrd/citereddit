This is easily the most requested topic ever since I started this channel about a year ago or so. I really hope this addresses it in a way that y'all were hoping for. 

NoFap has gained a lot of traction lately as many young men are noticing high speed internet porn's highly addictive properties. Some are noticing worsened confidence, high anxiety and even being improperly diagnosed with ADHD without thinking that what they do in private could be affecting them. It's difficult because our biology wants us to look at porn (really it wants us to create babies) and several doctors say porn and masturbation are healthy and natural - even that porn is good to spice up marital love lives. However, what we're dealing with since around 2000 is completely new and nothing like a playboy magazine. 

If you're interested in this topic, take the time to check out Gary Wilson's website https://yourbrainonporn.com/ or his book: "Your Brain on Porn" (http://amzn.to/2tioV4k)

(The irony of me inviting you to follow me on the platform I just ridiculed for  promoting distractibility in people is doing well. I fed and put him to bed.)

The point of the video is to encourage people to be mindful of how they use the internet, as what information you put into your minds is important just like the food you put in your stomach. It's a fantastic tool so there's no need to "quit" it, just be aware of how it affects you. 

Nicholas Carr's book "The Shallows" (http://amzn.to/2na38dq) was an excellent read and raises some unexpected points about how the internet affects the inner workings of your mind

Cal Newport's book "Deep Work" (http://amzn.to/2n3tRM3) was also a source of inspiration to make this video. In the book, he thoroughly makes the case that to reach enhanced levels of productivity and be successful in your professional or artistic pursuits, you really need to carve out long periods (2 hours) of time where you can work absolutely focused - no interruptions whatsoever.},

Twelve deaths from prostatic cancer were observed while 19.8 were expected. This represents a mortality experience significantly less than that of the general noncelibate population. Lower mortality ratios were found also for cancers of the lung, colo-rectum, and stomach. Higher mortality ratios were found for malignant melanoma and unspecified respiratory organs.},

	abstract = {The role of androgenic hormones in human sexuality, in the mechanism of erection and in the pathogenesis of impotence is under debate. While the use of testosterone is common in the clinical therapy of male erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism is a rare cause of impotence. We evaluated serum testosterone levels in men with erectile dysfunction resulting either from organic or non-organic causes before and after non-hormonal impotence therapy. Eighty-three consecutive cases of impotence (70\% organic, 30\% non-organic, vascular aetiology being the most frequent) were subjected to hormonal screening before and after various psychological, medical (prostaglandin E1, yohimbine) or mechanical therapies (vascular surgery, penile prostheses, vacuum devices). Thirty age-matched healthy men served as a control group. Compared to controls, patients with impotence resulting from both organic and non-organic causes showed reduced serum levels of both total testosterone (11.1 ± 2.4 vs. 17.7 ± 5.5 nmol/L) and free testosterone (56.2 ± 22.9 vs. 79.4 ± 27.0 pmol/L) (both p {\textless} 0.001). Irrespective of the different aetiologies and of the various impotence therapies, a dramatic increase in serum total and free testosterone levels (15.6 ± 4.2 nmol/L and 73.8 ± 22.5 pmol/L, respectively) was observed in patients who achieved normal sexual activity 3 months after commencing therapy (p {\textless} 0.001). On the contrary, serum testosterone levels did not change in patients in whom therapies were ineffective. Since the pre-therapy low testosterone levels were independent of the aetiology of impotence, we hypothesize that this hormonal pattern is related to the loss of sexual activity, as demonstrated by its normalization with the resumption of coital activity after different therapies. The corollary is that sexual activity may feed itself throughout the increase in testosterone levels.},

Residual symptoms are affective flattening, alogia, avolition, and asociality. Memantine 10 mg/day was added. After 1.5 months, the patient spontaneously referred to “feel better being in company of my relatives.” The following scales have been completed: the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (96), the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (3), the Mini Mental Scale Examination (26), and the Calgary Depression for Schizophrenia Scale (2). Memantine was increased to 20 mg/day and biperiden was decreased to 2 mg/day. Two months later, apathy and asociality considerably improved and affective flattening, alogia, and attention slightly got better (SANS 76, SAPS 1, MMSE 26, and CDSS 1). After two more months, the improvement continued in the same domains (SANS: 70, SAPS: 1 MMSE: 27, and CDSS: 1). Positive symptoms remained in full remission. It has been hypothesized that one of the causes of schizophrenia is glutamate excitotoxicity. Memantine, a glutamate receptor antagonist, could possibly ameliorate schizophrenia symptoms, the negative ones among them, used as add-on therapy to atypical antipsychotics. Memantine could be of potential help in schizophrenia patients with severe residual negative symptoms.},

	abstract = {Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC) is the main compound of the Cannabis Sativa responsible for most of the effects of the plant. Another major constituent is cannabidiol (CBD), formerly regarded to be devoid of pharmacological activity. However, laboratory rodents and human studies have shown that this cannabinoid is able to prevent psychotic-like symptoms induced by high doses of Δ(9)- THC. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that CBD has antipsychotic effects as observed using animal models and in healthy volunteers. Thus, this article provides a critical review of the research evaluating antipsychotic potential of this cannabinoid. CBD appears to have pharmacological profile similar to that of atypical antipsychotic drugs as seem using behavioral and neurochemical techniques in animal models. Additionally, CBD prevented human experimental psychosis and was effective in open case reports and clinical trials in patients with schizophrenia with a remarkable safety profile. Moreover, fMRI results strongly suggest that the antipsychotic effects of CBD in relation to the psychotomimetic effects of Δ(9)-THC involve the striatum and temporal cortex that have been traditionally associated with psychosis. Although the mechanisms of the antipsychotic properties are still not fully understood, we propose a hypothesis that could have a heuristic value to inspire new studies. These results support the idea that CBD may be a future therapeutic option in psychosis, in general and in schizophrenia, in particular.},

METHODS: We recruited a total of 10 outpatients with schizophrenia, all of whom gave informed consent. Participants took 3 tablets of SFN, consisting of 30 mg of SFN-glucosinolate per day, for 8 weeks. Clinical symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and cognitive function using the Japanese version of CogState battery were evaluated at the beginning of the study and at week 8.
RESULTS: A total of 7 patients completed the trial. The mean score in the Accuracy component of the One Card Learning Task increased significantly after the trial. However, we detected no other significant changes in participants.
CONCLUSIONS: This result suggests that SFN has the potential to improve cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {The glutamatergic system is a key point in pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Sarcosine (N-methylglycine) is an exogenous amino acid that acts as a glycine transporter inhibitor. It modulates glutamatergic transmission by increasing glycine concentration around NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors. In patients with schizophrenia, the function of the glutamatergic system in the prefrontal cortex is impaired, which may promote negative and cognitive symptoms. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy is a non-invasive imaging method enabling the evaluation of brain metabolite concentration, which can be applied to assess pharmacologically induced changes. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of a six-month course of sarcosine therapy on the concentration of metabolites (NAA, N-acetylaspartate; Glx, complex of glutamate, glutamine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA); mI, myo-inositol; Cr, creatine; Cho, choline) in the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in patients with stable schizophrenia. Fifty patients with schizophrenia, treated with constant antipsychotics doses, in stable clinical condition were randomly assigned to administration of sarcosine (25 patients) or placebo (25 patients) for six months. Metabolite concentrations in DLPFC were assessed with 1.5 Tesla 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Clinical symptoms were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The first spectroscopy revealed no differences in metabolite concentrations between groups. After six months, NAA/Cho, mI/Cr and mI/Cho ratios in the left DLPFC were significantly higher in the sarcosine than the placebo group. In the sarcosine group, NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, mI/Cr, mI/Cho ratios also significantly increased compared to baseline values. In the placebo group, only the NAA/Cr ratio increased. The addition of sarcosine to antipsychotic therapy for six months increased markers of neurons viability (NAA) and neurogilal activity (mI) with simultaneous improvement of clinical symptoms. Sarcosine, two grams administered daily, seems to be an effective adjuvant in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Previous investigations have suggested that changes in platelet activity may play a key role in the pathophysiology of migraine via mechanisms involving the nitric oxide (NO) pathway. Changes in platelet response and nitrite levels have recently been demonstrated during migraine attacks, while there is considerable uncertainty about NO activity in headache-free periods. A reactive oxidant produced from NO and superoxide anion at the site of inflammation, peroxynitrite (ONOO-) has effects including changes in membrane activity and fluidity. The aim of the present study was to determine ONOO- levels in the platelets of patients suffering from migraine during the headache-free period. Nitric oxide synthase (eNOS and iNOS) expression in platelets and the effects of ONOO- on membrane Na+/K+-ATPase activity and membrane fluidity were also evaluated. Subjects were 57 patients suffering from migraine without aura and 35 controls. Blood samples were collected in the headache-free period. Platelet ONOO- levels were determined using dichlorofluorescein acetate with steady-state fluorescence. Platelets were then probed for induction of eNOS and iNOS expression by western immunoblotting. Membrane Na+/K+-ATPase activity and fluidity were determined with the fluorescent probes TMA-DPH and DPH. In the presence of extracellular l-arginine(100 micromol/l), ONOO- production was significantly greater in patients' platelets than in those of controls (P {\textless} 0.001). Western immunoblotting of platelet proteins evidenced higher iNOS expression in patients than in controls. In addition, platelet membrane Na+/K+-ATPase activity and membrane fluidity evaluated by TMA-DPH were significantly lower in patients (P {\textless} 0.001). In conclusion, migraine patients show intercritic changes in platelet membrane fluidity and activity that may be related to the oxidative stress caused by increased ONOO- levels.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical efficacy of piracetam for the features of dementia or cognitive impairment, classified according to the major subtypes of dementia: vascular, Alzheimer's disease or mixed vascular and Alzheimer's disease, or unclassified dementia, or cognitive impairment not fulfilling the criteria for dementia.
SEARCH STRATEGY: The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 10 November 2000 using the term spiracetam, nootropic and 2-Oxo-1-pyrrolidine. In addition the pharmaceutical company responsible for marketing most of the piracetam worldwide, UCB Pharma, provided a comprehensive list of abstracts, which included many unpublished studies. As many of these unpublished, placebo-controlled studies will be reviewed as possible.
SELECTION CRITERIA: All unconfounded trials specified as randomized in which treatment with piracetam was administered for more than a day and compared with placebo in patients with dementia of Alzheimer type, vascular dementia,or mixed vascular and Alzheimer's disease, or unclassified dementia, or cognitive impairment not fulfilling the criteria for dementia.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Each study was independently verified as fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Studies were rated for methodological quality by assessment of blinding and loss before analysis as described by Jadad et al. (1996). Studies were pooled if appropriate and possible, and the pooled odds ratios (95\%CI) or the average differences (95\%CI) were estimated. Where possible, intention-to-treat analyses were undertaken. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine if successive elimination of those studies performing most poorly on these quality criteria changed the effect estimate.
MAIN RESULTS: Unfortunately, many of the studies were of cross-over design and first-phase data were unavailable, or could not be extracted. Global Impression of Change was the only outcoeme for which there was a significant volume of evidence from the pooled data. There was evidence of heterogeneity in the results from the individual studies, chi-square test = 20.8 (df=5). Using a fixed effects model the odds ratio for improvement in the piracetam group compared with the placebo group was 3.55, [95\% CI][2.45, 5.16]. If a random effects model was used the odds ratio was 3.47 [1.29, 9.30]. If one single-blind study was excluded, the fixed effects model yielded an odds ratio of 3.36 [2.29, 4.99] and if a random effects model was applied then the odds ratio was 2.89 [1.01, 8.24]. The evidence of effects on cognition and other measures, was inconclusive.
REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: At this stage the evidence available from the published literature does not support the use of piracetam in the treatment of people with dementia or cognitive impairment. Although effects were found on global impression of change, no benefit was shown by any of the more specific measures. There is a need for further evaluation of piracetam by : 1) Obtaining the data from the identified studies for an individual patient database review, 2) Performing a randomized trial of piracetam in patients with diagnoses made by currently accepted diagnostic criteria. The trial should extend over for a period of at least 6 months and preferably longer. Specific cognitive instruments which are sensitive to change, Clinician Global Impression of Change, levels of dependency and caregiver quality of life scales should also be incorporated in such a study.},

	abstract = {Sarcosine, a natural amino acid found in muscles and other body tissues, is an endogenous glycine transporter type 1 inhibitor that increases the glycine concentration, resulting in an indirect potentiation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors. Sarcosine, similar to other NMDA receptor-activating agents, is an effective adjuvant in the treatment of schizophrenia. It is widely accepted that increased glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in the initiation and propagation of seizures. Because sarcosine facilitates NMDA receptor function, it may affect the seizure threshold. Therefore, we examined the effects of sarcosine on the seizure threshold in two different mouse seizure models: the timed intravenous (iv) pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) infusion test and the maximal electroshock seizure threshold test. In the iv PTZ test, sarcosine did not exert a significant effect on the seizure threshold at any of the doses tested (100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg, ip). However, at doses of 400 and 800 mg/kg, sarcosine significantly raised the threshold for electroconvulsions (p {\textless} 0.01). The present findings indicate that sarcosine did not lower the seizure threshold. Conversely, sarcosine showed weak anticonvulsant properties by increasing the threshold current for the induction of tonic seizures. Therefore, sarcosine may be considered as a safe adjuvant treatment for schizophrenia without proconvulsant risk. In addition, the compound may serve as an interesting addition to epilepsy treatment.},

Information concerning risk factors for SUDEP is conflicting, but high seizure frequency is a potential risk factor. Additionally, potential pathomechanisms for SUDEP are unknown, but it is very probable that cardiac arrhythmias during and between seizures or transmission of epileptic activity to the heart via the autonomic nervous system potentially play a role. In parallel, studies have shown a link between vitamin D dysfunction and epilepsy. Moreover, several evidences in the literature suggest an association between low vitamin D and seizures, indicating the possibility of anticonvulsant properties of this hormone. Quite interesting, a growing body of data suggests that low vitamin D levels may adversely affect cardiovascular health, directly associated with death from heart failure and sudden cardiac death. In view of the above findings, our research group focused in this review article that SUDEP, at least in some cases, could be related with low vitamin D levels.},

METHODS: Pilot, randomized, double-blind two-period crossover clinical trial of high-dose fish oil (9600 mg of fish oil/day, 2880 mg of n-3 fatty acids) in 11 subjects with refractory seizures. Outcomes included seizure frequency, seizure severity, lipid panel, and heart rate variability as measured by SDNN and SDANN (defined as the standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals for 1h, and the standard deviation of all R-R intervals in each successive 5-min epoch, respectively).
RESULTS: Preliminary data identified trends towards lower seizure severity, lower triglycerides, higher HDL, and increased SDNN/SDANN in those with low SDNN/SDANN at baseline (Spearman's correlation=-0.65, P=0.03). No positive effect on seizure frequency was identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Further study of the effect of n-3 fatty acids is indicated in people with epilepsy, as favorable trends were identified on cardiac risk factors (triglycerides) and in a subgroup with low heart rate variability (low SDNN/SDANN), a marker of sudden death risk. To our knowledge, this is the first trial to explore the beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids on cardiac risk factors and heart rate variability in people with epilepsy.},

Since there is evidence that prolactin (PRL) is, among the endocrine signals, a major mediator of seasonal adaptations, the authors aimed to examine whether melatonin administration in drinking water resembling in length the exposure to a winter photoperiod could affect accordingly the 24-h pattern of PRL synthesis and release and some of their anterior pituitary redox state and circadian clock modulatory mechanisms. Melatonin (3 µg/mL drinking water) or vehicle was given for 1 mo, and rats were euthanized at six time intervals during a 24-h cycle. High concentrations of melatonin ({\textgreater}2000 pg/mL) were detected in melatonin-treated rats from beginning of scotophase (at 21:00 h) to early photophase (at 09:00 h) as compared with a considerably narrower high-melatonin phase observed in controls. By cosinor analysis, melatonin-treated rats had significantly decreased MESOR (24-h time-series average) values of anterior pituitary PRL gene expression and circulating PRL, with acrophases (peak time) located in the middle of the scotophase, as in the control group. Melatonin treatment disrupted the 24-h pattern of anterior pituitary gene expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-1 and -2, heme oxygenase-1 and -2, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, Cu/Zn- and Mn-superoxide dismutase, and catalase by shifting their acrophases to early/middle scotophase or amplifying the maxima. Only the inhibitory effect of melatonin on pituitary NOS-2 gene expression correlated temporally with inhibition of PRL production. Gene expression of metallothionein-1 and -3 showed maxima at early/middle photophase after melatonin treatment. The 24-h pattern of anterior pituitary lipid peroxidation did not vary after treatment. In vehicle-treated rats, Clock and Bmal1 expression peaked in the anterior pituitary at middle scotophase, whereas that of Per1 and Per2 and of Cry1 and Cry2 peaked at the middle and late photophase, respectively. Treatment with melatonin raised mean expression of anterior pituitary Per2, Cry1, and Cry2. In the case of Per1, decreased MESOR was observed, although the single significant difference found between the experimental groups when analyzed at individual time intervals was increase at early scotophase in the anterior pituitary of melatonin-treated rats. Melatonin significantly phase-delayed expression of Per1, Per2, and Cry1, also phase-delayed the plasma corticosterone circadian rhythm, and increased the amplitude of plasma corticosterone and thyrotropin rhythms. The results indicate that under prolonged duration of a daily melatonin signal, rat anterior pituitary PRL synthesis and release are depressed, together with significant changes in the redox and circadian mechanisms controlling them.},

The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of melatonin on plasma levels of Prolactin and Cortisol (ηg/ml). Methods: Five adult male rhesus monkeys were used for the purpose. Monkeys were maintained at ad libitum. Melatonin 5 mg was administered orally to all five monkeys. Sequential blood samples were collected at 15 minute intervals in heparinised syringes. Plasma Prolactin and Cortisol were analysed by ELISA and RIA respectively. Results: Melatonin oral single dose (5 mg) increased the plasma prolactin concentration in all five monkeys after 15 minute of treatment and this increase remained until 60 min but this increase was not significant compared to before treatment concentration. The highest mean concentration of prolactin was observed at 15 to 60 minute (6.38±0.18 ηg/ml) and the lowest mean concentration was observed between 75 to 120 minute interval (5.43±0.22 ηg/ml). Decrease in the later was significant compared to former (p{\textless}0.001). Present study results showed significant effect of melatonin in terms of reduction on plasma prolactin concentration (F (2,52)= 3.989; p{\textless}0.05). The study results showed no significant effect of melatonin on plasma Cortisol concentration (F (2,52) =0.074; p{\textgreater}0.05) in adult male rhesus monkeys.

	abstract = {Although all cells in the body require energy to survive and function properly, excessive calorie intake over long time periods can compromise cell function and promote disorders such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes and cancers. Accordingly, dietary restriction (DR; either caloric restriction or intermittent fasting, with maintained vitamin and mineral intake) can extend lifespan and can increase disease resistance. Recent studies have shown that DR can have profound effects on brain function and vulnerability to injury and disease. DR can protect neurons against degeneration in animal models of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases and stroke. Moreover, DR can stimulate the production of new neurons from stem cells (neurogenesis) and can enhance synaptic plasticity, which may increase the ability of the brain to resist aging and restore function following injury. Interestingly, increasing the time interval between meals can have beneficial effects on the brain and overall health of mice that are independent of cummulative calorie intake. The beneficial effects of DR, particularly those of intermittent fasting, appear to be the result of a cellular stress response that stimulates the production of proteins that enhance neuronal plasticity and resistance to oxidative and metabolic insults; they include neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), protein chaperones such as heat-shock proteins, and mitochondrial uncoupling proteins. Some beneficial effects of DR can be achieved by administering hormones that suppress appetite (leptin and ciliary neurotrophic factor) or by supplementing the diet with 2-deoxy-d-glucose, which may act as a calorie restriction mimetic. The profound influences of the quantity and timing of food intake on neuronal function and vulnerability to disease have revealed novel molecular and cellular mechanisms whereby diet affects the nervous system, and are leading to novel preventative and therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative disorders.},

Studies suggest that during times of acute brain injury, cerebral uptake of ketones increases significantly. Researchers have thus attempted to attenuate the effects of cerebral injury by administering ketones exogenously. Hypertonic saline is commonly utilized for management of intracranial hypertension following cerebral injury. A solution containing both hypertonic saline and ketones may prove ideal for managing the dual problems of refractory intracranial hypertension and low cerebral energy levels.

It is established that nooglutil exhibits pharmacologically significant competition with a selective agonist of AMPA receptors ([G-3H]Ro 48-8587) for the receptor binding sites (with IC50 = 6.4 +/- 0.2 microM), while the competition of noopept for these receptor binding sites was lower by an order of magnitude (IC50 = 80 +/- 5.6 microM). The heptapeptide drug semax was moderately competitive with [G-3H]LY 354740 for mGlu receptor sites (IC50 = 33 +/- 2.4 microM). Dimebon moderately influenced the specific binding of the ligand of NMDA receptor channel ([G-3H]MK-801) at IC50 = 59 +/- 3.6 microM. Nootropic drugs of the pyrrolidone group (piracetam, phenotropil) as well as meclofenoxate, pantocalcine (pantogam) in a broad rage of concentrations (10(-4)-10(-10) M) did not affect the binding of the corresponding ligands to glutamate receptors (IC50 100 pM). Thus, the direct neurochemical investigation was used for the first time to qualitatively characterize the specific binding sites for nooglutil and (to a lower extent) noopept on AMPA receptors, for semax on metabotropic glutamate receptors, and for dimebon on the channel region of NMDA receptors. The results are indicative of a selective action of some nootropes on the glutamate family.},

	abstract = {Background:
The development of rapid and safe antidepressants for the treatment of major depression is in urgent demand. Converging evidence suggests that glutamatergic signaling seems to play important roles in the pathophysiology of depression.

Methods:
We studied the antidepressant effects of 3’-deoxyadenosine (3’-dA, Cordycepin) and the critical role of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor in male CD-1 mice via behavioral and biochemical experiments. After 3’-dA treatment, the phosphorylation and synaptic localization of the AMPA receptors GluR1 and GluR2 were determined in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIP). The traditional antidepressant imipramine was applied as a positive control.

Results:
We found that an injection of 3’-dA led to a rapid and robust antidepressant effect, which was significantly faster and stronger than imipramine, after 45min in tail suspension and forced swim tests. This antidepressant effect remained after 5 days of treatment with 3’-dA. Unlike the psycho-stimulants, 3’-dA did not show a hyperactive effect in the open field test. After 45min or 5 days of treatment, 3’-dA enhanced GluR1 S845 phosphorylation in both the PFC and HIP. In addition, after 45min of treatment, 3’-dA significantly up-regulated GluR1 S845 phosphorylation and GluR1, but not GluR2 levels, at the synapses in the PFC. After 5 days of treatment, 3’-dA significantly enhanced GluR1 S845 phosphorylation and GluR1, but not GluR2, at the synapses in the PFC and HIP. Moreover, the AMPA-specific antagonist GYKI 52466 was able to block the rapid antidepressant effects of 3’-dA.

Conclusion:
This study identified 3’-dA as a novel rapid antidepressant with clinical potential and multiple beneficial mechanisms, particularly in regulating the prefrontal AMPA receptor signaling pathway.},

	abstract = {The stimulatory effect of Cordyceps sinensis (CS) on MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cell steroidogenesis was previously demonstrated in our laboratory. In the present studies, we further determined the effect of CS on steroidogenesis in purified normal mouse Leydig cells. Different concentrations of CS (0.1-10 mg/ml) were added to Leydig cells without or with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (50 ng/ml), and the steroid production was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The results illustrated that CS stimulated normal mouse Leydig cell steroidogenesis in a dose-dependent relationship. CS at 3 mg/ml significantly stimulated testosterone production (p{\textless}0.05). Concerning the temporal relationship, CS at 3 mg/ml stimulated maximal testosterone production between 2 to 3 hr. Interestingly, hCG-stimulated testosterone productions were suppressed by CS in a dose-dependent relationship. CS also reduced dbcAMP-stimulated testosterone productions, which indicated that CS affected signal transduction pathway of steroidogenesis after the formation of cyclic AMP. Moreover, cycloheximide inhibited CS-treated mouse Leydig cell testosterone production, suggesting that new protein synthesis was required for CS-stimulated steroidogenesis.},

	abstract = {Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF)-1 is a dimeric protein complex that plays an integral role in the body's response to low oxygen concentrations, or hypoxia. HIF-1 is among the primary genes involved in the homeostatic process, which can increase vascularization in hypoxic areas such as localized ischemia and tumors. It is a transcription factor for dozens of target genes; HIF-1 is also essential for immunological responses and is a crucial physiological regulator of homeostasis, vascularization, and anaerobic metabolism. Furthermore, HIF-1 is increasingly studied because of its perceived therapeutic potential. As it causes angiogenesis, enhancement of this gene within ischemic patients could promote the vessel proliferation needed for oxygenation. In contrast, as HIF-1 allows for survival and proliferation of cancerous cells due to its angiogenic properties, inhibition potentially could prevent the spread of cancer. With a growing understanding of the HIF-1 pathway, the inhibition and stimulation of its transcriptional activity via small molecules is now an attractive goal. Gene therapy to achieve both vessel proliferation and tumor regression has been demonstrated in animal studies but requires significant improvement and modification before becoming commercially available. This review focuses on the potential of the HIF-1 pathway in therapeutic intervention for the treatment of diseases such as cancer and ischemia.},

METHODS: The diabetes model was produced by intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg streptozotocin, then the rats whose 24 h urine protein level was above 30 mg/d were thought to have suffered diabetic nephropathy. Thirty rats were randomly divided into a diabetic nephropathy group (DN group, n=15) and a Cordyceps sinensis group (CS group, n=15), and another 15 normal rats served as a normal control group (NC group, n=15). The CS group were intragastrically administered Cordyceps sinensis extract liquid [5.0 g/(kg.d)], the other groups were intragastrically administered drinking water of equal volume. Five rats in each group were killed after 2, 4, and 6 weeks. The 24 h urine protein excretion, urine β-N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAGase) and serum creatinine were measured; the renal pathological changes were evaluated by HE and Masson staining; the mRNA and protein expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF were dectected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Compared with the normal control group, the renal tubular vacuolar degeneration was obvious, and the glomerular mesangial matrix increased in the DN group. The 24 h urinary protein excretion, urine NAGase and serum creatinine also increased significantly (all P{\textless}0.05); the expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF in the renal tissue gradually increased with time, and the expression of HIF-1α was correlated with that of VEGF in the 2 groups (r=0.850, r=0.887, both P{\textless}0.05) . Compared with the DN group, the pathological changes were relieved, the 24 h urinary protein excretion, urine NAGase and serum creatinine level were decreased, and the expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF decreased in the CS group (all P{\textless}0.05), but they were still higher than those in the normal contral group (P{\textless}0.05). There was no significant difference in the mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1α between the 4th week and the 6th week after the treatment of CS (P{\textgreater}0.05).
CONCLUSION: The expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF increase in the kidney of rats with diabetic nephropathy, and the positive correlation suggests that there is chronic hypoxia in the renal tissue of diabetic nephropathy. Cordyceps sinensis may protect against chronic hypoxia injury in diabetic nephropathy by lowering the expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF.},

The need for such reviews is necessitated by the fact that no research is perfect and experts are prone to bias. By combining many studies that fulfill specific criteria, one hopes that the strengths can be multiplied and thus reliable conclusions attained. Potential flaws in this process include the assumptions that underlie the research under examination. If the assumptions, or axioms, upon which the research studies are based, are untenable either scientifically or logically, then the results must be highly suspect regardless of the otherwise high quality of the studies or the systematic reviews. We outline recent criticisms of animal-based research, namely that animal models are failing to predict human responses. It is this failure that is purportedly being corrected via systematic reviews. We then examine the assumption that animal models can predict human outcomes to perturbations such as disease or drugs, even under the best of circumstances. We examine the use of animal models in light of empirical evidence comparing human outcomes to those from animal models, complexity theory, and evolutionary biology. We conclude that even if legitimate criticisms of animal models were addressed, through standardization of protocols and systematic reviews, the animal model would still fail as a predictive modality for human response to drugs and disease. Therefore, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of animal-based research are poor tools for attempting to reach conclusions regarding human interventions.},

Difference between models was small since most global relative risks were between 0.76 and 1.00. A closer look showed that carcinogen-induced rat studies matched human trials for aspirin, calcium, carotene, and were compatible for wheat bran. Min mice results were compatible with human results for aspirin, but discordant for calcium and wheat bran (no carotene study). These few results suggest that rodent models roughly predict effect in humans, but the prediction is not accurate for all agents. Based on three cases only, the carcinogen-induced rat model seems better than the Min mouse model. However, rodent studies are useful to screen potential chemopreventive agents, and to study mechanisms of carcinogenesis and chemoprevention.},

Animal studies for interventions with unambiguous evidence of a treatment effect (benefit or harm) in clinical trials: head injury, antifibrinolytics in haemorrhage, thrombolysis in acute ischaemic stroke, tirilazad in acute ischaemic stroke, antenatal corticosteroids to prevent neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and bisphosphonates to treat osteoporosis. Review methods Data were extracted on study design, allocation concealment, number of randomised animals, type of model, intervention, and outcome.
Corticosteroids did not show any benefit in clinical trials of treatment for head injury but did show a benefit in animal models (pooled odds ratio for adverse functional outcome 0.58, 95\% confidence interval 0.41 to 0.83). Antifibrinolytics reduced bleeding in clinical trials but the data were inconclusive in animal models. Thrombolysis improved outcome in patients with ischaemic stroke. In animal models, tissue plasminogen activator reduced infarct volume by 24\% (95\% confidence interval 20\% to 28\%) and improved neurobehavioural scores by 23\% (17\% to 29\%). Tirilazad was associated with a worse outcome in patients with ischaemic stroke. In animal models, tirilazad reduced infarct volume by 29\% (21\% to 37\%) and improved neurobehavioural scores by 48\% (29\% to 67\%). Antenatal corticosteroids reduced respiratory distress and mortality in neonates whereas in animal models respiratory distress was reduced but the effect on mortality was inconclusive (odds ratio 4.2, 95\% confidence interval 0.85 to 20.9). Bisphosphonates increased bone mineral density in patients with osteoporosis. In animal models the bisphosphonate alendronate increased bone mineral density compared with placebo by 11.0\% (95\% confidence interval 9.2\% to 12.9\%) in the combined results for the hip region. The corresponding treatment effect in the lumbar spine was 8.5\% (5.8\% to 11.2\%) and in the combined results for the forearms (baboons only) was 1.7\% (-1.4\% to 4.7\%).
Discordance between animal and human studies may be due to bias or to the failure of animal models to mimic clinical disease adequately.},

However, recent publications have raised concerns with regard to what extent animals and humans respond similar to physiological stimuli. Original data on direct in vivo comparison between animals and humans are scarce and no study has addressed this issue after exercise. We aimed to compare side by side in the same experimental setup rat and human responses to an acute exercise bout of matched intensity and duration. Rats and humans ran on a treadmill at 86\% of maximal velocity until exhaustion. Pre and post exercise we measured 30 blood chemistry parameters, which evaluate iron status, lipid profile, glucose regulation, protein metabolism, liver, and renal function. ANOVA indicated that almost all biochemical parameters followed a similar alteration pattern post exercise in rats and humans. In fact, there were only 2/30 significant species × exercise interactions (in testosterone and globulins), indicating different responses to exercise between rats and humans. On the contrary, the main effect of exercise was significant in 15/30 parameters and marginally nonsignificant in other two parameters (copper, P = 0.060 and apolipoprotein B, P = 0.058). Our major finding is that the rat adequately mimics human responses to exercise in those basic blood biochemical parameters reported here. The physiological resemblance of rat and human blood responses after exercise to exhaustion on a treadmill indicates that the use of blood chemistry in rats for exercise physiology research is justified.},

The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5\% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L. The largest meta-analysis ever conducted of studies published between 1966 and 2013 showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels {\textless}75 nmol/L may be too low for safety and associated with higher all-cause mortality, demolishing the previously presumed U-shape curve of mortality associated with vitamin D levels. Since all-disease mortality is reduced to 1.0 with serum vitamin D levels ≥100 nmol/L, we call public health authorities to consider designating as the RDA at least three-fourths of the levels proposed by the Endocrine Society Expert Committee as safe upper tolerable daily intake doses. This could lead to a recommendation of 1000 IU for children {\textless}1 year on enriched formula and 1500 IU for breastfed children older than 6 months, 3000 IU for children {\textgreater}1 year of age, and around 8000 IU for young adults and thereafter.

The present study explored the neuroprotective effects of H. erinaceus mycelium polysaccharide-enriched aqueous extract (HE) on an l-glutamic acid (l-Glu)-induced differentiated PC12 (DPC12) cellular apoptosis model and an AlCl3 combined with d-galactose-induced Alzheimer’s disease mouse model. The data revealed that HE successfully induced PC12 cell differentiation. A 3 h HE incubation at doses of 50 and 100 µg/mL before 25 mM of l-Glu effectively reversed the reduction of cell viability and the enhancement of the nuclear apoptosis rate in DPC12 cells. Compared with l-Glu-damaged cells, in PC12 cells, HE suppressed intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, blocked Ca2+ overload and prevented mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization. In the Alzheimer’s disease mouse model, HE administration enhanced the horizontal and vertical movements in the autonomic activity test, improved the endurance time in the rotarod test, and decreased the escape latency time in the water maze test. It also improved the central cholinergic system function in the Alzheimer’s mice, demonstrated by the fact that it dose-dependently enhanced the acetylcholine (Ach) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) concentrations in both the serum and the hypothalamus. Our findings provide experimental evidence that HE may provide neuroprotective candidates for treating or preventing neurodegenerative diseases.},

This process has been linked to learning and memory, stress and exercise, and is thought to be altered in neurological disease6,7,8,9,10. In humans, some studies have suggested that hundreds of new neurons are added to the adult dentate gyrus every day11, whereas other studies find many fewer putative new neurons12,13,14. Despite these discrepancies, it is generally believed that the adult human hippocampus continues to generate new neurons. Here we show that a defined population of progenitor cells does not coalesce in the subgranular zone during human fetal or postnatal development. We also find that the number of proliferating progenitors and young neurons in the dentate gyrus declines sharply during the first year of life and only a few isolated young neurons are observed by 7 and 13 years of age. In adult patients with epilepsy and healthy adults (18â€“77 years; n = 17 post-mortem samples from controls; n = 12 surgical resection samples from patients with epilepsy), young neurons were not detected in the dentate gyrus. In the monkey (Macaca mulatta) hippocampus, proliferation of neurons in the subgranular zone was found in early postnatal life, but this diminished during juvenile development as neurogenesis decreased. We conclude that recruitment of young neurons to the primate hippocampus decreases rapidly during the first years of life, and that neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus does not continue, or is extremely rare, in adult humans. The early decline in hippocampal neurogenesis raises questions about how the function of the dentate gyrus differs between humans and other species in which adult hippocampal neurogenesis is preserved.},

In rodents, classical antidepressants reverse the symptoms of depression by stimulating neuronal proliferation. It has been shown that Ayahuasca presents antidepressant effects in patients with depressive disorder. In the present study, we investigated the effects of harmine in cell cultures containing human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs, 97\% nestin-positive) derived from pluripotent stem cells. After 4 days of treatment, the pool of proliferating hNPCs increased by 71.5\%. Harmine has been reported as a potent inhibitor of the dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK1A), which regulates cell proliferation and brain development. We tested the effect of analogs of harmine, an inhibitor of DYRK1A (INDY), and an irreversible selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) but not DYRK1A (pargyline). INDY but not pargyline induced proliferation of hNPCs similarly to harmine, suggesting that inhibition of DYRK1A is a possible mechanism to explain harmine effects upon the proliferation of hNPCs. Our findings show that harmine enhances proliferation of hNPCs and suggest that inhibition of DYRK1A may explain its effects upon proliferation in vitro and antidepressant effects in vivo.},

	abstract = {Background and Objective
Low level light (or laser) therapy (LLLT) is a rapidly growing modality used in physical therapy, chiropractic, sports medicine and increasingly in mainstream medicine. LLLT is used to increase wound healing and tissue regeneration, to relieve pain and inflammation, to prevent tissue death, to mitigate degeneration in many neurological indications. While some agreement has emerged on the best wavelengths of light and a range of acceptable dosages to be used (irradiance and fluence), there is no agreement on whether continuous wave or pulsed light is best and on what factors govern the pulse parameters to be chosen.

Study Design/Materials and Methods
The published peer-reviewed literature was reviewed between 1970 and 2010.

Results
The basic molecular and cellular mechanisms of LLLT are discussed. The type of pulsed light sources available and the parameters that govern their pulse structure are outlined. Studies that have compared continuous wave and pulsed light in both animals and patients are reviewed. Frequencies used in other pulsed modalities used in physical therapy and biomedicine are compared to those used in LLLT.

Conclusion
There is some evidence that pulsed light does have effects that are different from those of continuous wave light. However further work is needed to define these effects for different disease conditions and pulse structures.},

This study focused on the transcranial LLLT effects on the D-galactose (DG)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and cognitive impairment in mice. For this purpose, red and near-infrared (NIR) laser wavelengths (660 and 810 nm) at 2 different fluencies (4 and 8 J/cm2) at 10-Hz pulsed wave mode were administrated transcranially 3 d/wk in DG-received (500 mg/kg/subcutaneous) mice model of aging for 6 weeks. Spatial and episodic-like memories were assessed by the Barnes maze and What-Where-Which (WWWhich) tasks. Brain tissues were analyzed for mitochondrial function including active mitochondria, adenosine triphosphate, and reactive oxygen species levels, as well as membrane potential and cytochrome c oxidase activity. Apoptosis-related biomarkers, namely, Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 were evaluated by Western blotting method. Laser treatments at wavelengths of 660 and 810 nm at 8 J/cm2 attenuated DG-impaired spatial and episodic-like memories. Also, results showed an obvious improvement in the mitochondrial function aspects and modulatory effects on apoptotic markers in aged mice. However, same wavelengths at the fluency of 4 J/cm2 had poor effect on the behavioral and molecular indexes in aging model. This data indicates that transcranial LLLT at both of red and NIR wavelengths at the fluency of 8 J/cm2 has a potential to ameliorate aging-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and cognitive impairment.},

We obtained some evidence for neurogenesis in the region of the lesion. We now tested the hypothesis that tLLLT can improve performance on the Morris water maze (MWM, learning, and memory) and increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus and subventricular zone (SVZ) after CCI-TBI in mice. One and (to a greater extent) three daily laser treatments commencing 4-h post-TBI improved neurological performance as measured by wire grip and motion test especially at 3 and 4 weeks post-TBI. Improvements in visible and hidden platform latency and probe tests in MWM were seen at 4 weeks. Caspase-3 expression was lower in the lesion region at 4 days post-TBI. Double-stained BrdU-NeuN (neuroprogenitor cells) was increased in the dentate gyrus and SVZ. Increases in double-cortin (DCX) and TUJ-1 were also seen. Our study results suggest that tLLLT may improve TBI both by reducing cell death in the lesion and by stimulating neurogenesis.},

One area that is attracting growing interest in this scope is the use of transcranial LLLT to treat stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). We developed a mouse model of severe TBI induced by controlled cortical impact and explored the effect of different treatment schedules. Adult male BALB/c mice were divided into 3 broad groups (a) sham-TBI sham-treatment, (b) real-TBI sham-treatment, and (c) real-TBI active-treatment. Mice received active-treatment (transcranial LLLT by continuous wave 810 nm laser, 25 mW/cm2, 18 J/cm2, spot diameter 1 cm) while sham-treatment was immobilization only, delivered either as a single treatment at 4 hours post TBI, as 3 daily treatments commencing at 4 hours post TBI or as 14 daily treatments. Mice were sacrificed at 0, 4, 7, 14 and 28 days post-TBI for histology or histomorphometry, and injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) at days 21â€“27 to allow identification of proliferating cells. Mice with severe TBI treated with 1-laser Tx (and to a greater extent 3-laser Tx) had significant improvements in neurological severity score (NSS), and wire-grip and motion test (WGMT). However 14-laser Tx provided no benefit over TBI-sham control. Mice receiving 1- and 3-laser Tx had smaller lesion size at 28-days (although the size increased over 4 weeks in all TBI-groups) and less Fluoro-Jade staining for degenerating neurons (at 14 days) than in TBI control and 14-laser Tx groups. There were more BrdU-positive cells in the lesion in 1- and 3-laser groups suggesting LLLT may increase neurogenesis. Transcranial NIR laser may provide benefit in cases of acute TBI provided the optimum treatment regimen is employed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cycling is an endurance sport relying mainly on aerobic capacity to provide fuel during long-duration cycling events. Athletes are constantly searching for new methods to improve this capacity through various nutritional and ergogenic aids.s
PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to find out the effect of Ashwagandha on the cardiorespiratory endurance capacity, that is, aerobic capacity of elite Indian cyclists.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty elite (elite here refers to the participation of the athlete in at least state-level events) Indian cyclists were chosen randomly and were equally divided into experimental and placebo groups. The experimental group received 500 mg capsules of aqueous roots of Ashwagandha twice daily for eight weeks, whereas the placebo group received starch capsules.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The baseline treadmill test for the cyclists were performed to measure their aerobic capacity in terms of maximal aerobic capacity (VO(2) max), metabolic equivalent, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and total time for the athlete to reach his exhaustion stage. After eight weeks of supplementation, the treadmill test was again performed and results were obtained.
RESULTS: There was significant improvement in the experimental group in all parameters, whereas the placebo group did not show any change with respect to their baseline parameters. There was significant improvement in the experimental group in all parameters, namely, VO(2) max (t = 5.356; P {\textless} 0.001), METS (t = 4.483; P {\textless} 0.001), and time for exhaustion on treadmill (t = 4.813; P {\textless} 0.001) in comparison to the placebo group which did not show any change with respect to their baseline parameters.
CONCLUSION: Ashwagandha improved the cardiorespiratory endurance of the elite athletes.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Several medicinal plants have been described to be beneficial for cardiac ailments in Ayurveda like Ashwagandha and Arjuna. Ashwagandha-categorised as Rasayanas, and described to promote health and longevity and Arjuna primarily for heart ailments. coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypercholesterolemia, anginal pain and can be considered as a useful drug for coronary artery disease, hypertension and ischemic cardiomyopathy.
OBJECTIVE: There are no scientific clinical studies showing effect of both these drugs on exercise performance after regular administration when given as supplements The present study was therefore designed and performed to assess the effects of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) and Terminalia arjuna (Arjuna) individually and as a combination on maximum velocity, average absolute and relative Power, balance, maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and blood pressure in humans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty normal healthy. Subjects (either sex, mean age 20.6 ± 2.5yrs and mean Body Mass Index 21.9 ± 2.2) were recruited after written informed consent was obtained. Institutional Ethics Committee permission was also obtained. Thirty participants were assigned to experimental group of which 10 received standardized root extracts of Withania somnifera, 10 received standardized bark extract of Terminalia arjuna and the rest of the 10 received standardized root extract of Withania somnifera in addition to bark extract of Terminalia arjuna both. Both the drugs were given in the form of capsules (dosage 500mg/day for both the drugs). Ten participants received placebo (capsules filled with flour). All the subjects continued the regimen for 8 weeks. All variables were assessed before and after the course of drug administration
OBSERVATIONS: Our study showed that Withania somnifera increased velocity, power and VO2 max whereas Terminalia arjuna increased VO2 max and lowered resting systolic blood pressure. When given in combination, the improvement was seen in all parameters except balance and diastolic blood pressure.
CONCLUSION: Withania somnifera may therefore be useful for generalized weakness and to improve speed and lower limb muscular strength and neuro-muscular co-ordination. Terminalia arjuna may prove useful to improve cardio-vascular endurance and lowering systolic blood pressure. Both drugs appear to be safe for young adults when given for mentioned dosage and duration.},

The ability to change the rates of serotonin synthesis in the brain by manipulating concentrations of serum tryptophan is the foundation of much research. As the sole precursor of serotonin, experimental research has shown that L-tryptophan’s role in brain serotonin synthesis is an important factor involved in mood, behavior, and cognition. Furthermore, clinical trials have provided some initial evidence of L-tryptophan’s efficacy for treatment of psychiatric disorders, particularly when used in combination with other therapeutic agents.},

The effects on behavior of daily oral doses of sulforaphane (50-150 Âµmol) for 18 wk, followed by 4 wk without treatment, were quantified by three widely accepted behavioral measures completed by parents/caregivers and physicians: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I). Initial scores for ABC and SRS were closely matched for participants assigned to placebo and sulforaphane. After 18 wk, participants receiving placebo experienced minimal change ({\textless}3.3\%), whereas those receiving sulforaphane showed substantial declines (improvement of behavior): 34\% for ABC (P {\textless} 0.001, comparing treatments) and 17\% for SRS scores (P = 0.017). On CGI-I, a significantly greater number of participants receiving sulforaphane had improvement in social interaction, abnormal behavior, and verbal communication (P = 0.015-0.007). Upon discontinuation of sulforaphane, total scores on all scales rose toward pretreatment levels. Dietary sulforaphane, of recognized low toxicity, was selected for its capacity to reverse abnormalities that have been associated with ASD, including oxidative stress and lower antioxidant capacity, depressed glutathione synthesis, reduced mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation, increased lipid peroxidation, and neuroinflammmation.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children, is characterized by impaired social interaction and communication as well as restricted or repetitive behaviors, and varies widely with respect to its causes and presentations. There are no validated pharmacologic treatments for the core symptoms of ASD. The social, medical, and economic burdens of ASD on families and caregivers are profound. We recently showed in a small clinical trial that sulforaphane (SF) from broccoli sprouts could significantly reduce the behavioral symptoms of ASD.

Methods
After we completed the intervention phase of the original trial (2011â€“2013), many caregivers used over-the-counter dietary SF supplements in order to attempt to maintain improvements similar to those noted during the intervention. We periodically followed the progress of study participants through the summer of 2016.

Results
Families of 16 of the 26 subjects who received SF as part of the original study responded to requests for further information. Of these subjects, 6 did not continue taking SF supplements after the study. Nine of the 16 subjects are still taking an SF supplement and a 10th planned to. We present the edited testimonials of their caregivers in this case series.

Conclusions
Many parents and caregivers articulated the positive effects of SF, both during the intervention phase and in the ensuing 3 years reported herein. These observations may contribute to understanding ASD and to treatments that may alleviate some of its symptoms. Diet- and supplement-based therapies deserve careful consideration for their potential to provide vital clinical as well as biochemical information about ASD.},

	abstract = {The glutamatergic system is a key point in pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Sarcosine (N-methylglycine) is an exogenous amino acid that acts as a glycine transporter inhibitor. It modulates glutamatergic transmission by increasing glycine concentration around NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors. In patients with schizophrenia, the function of the glutamatergic system in the prefrontal cortex is impaired, which may promote negative and cognitive symptoms. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy is a non-invasive imaging method enabling the evaluation of brain metabolite concentration, which can be applied to assess pharmacologically induced changes. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of a six-month course of sarcosine therapy on the concentration of metabolites (NAA, N-acetylaspartate; Glx, complex of glutamate, glutamine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA); mI, myo-inositol; Cr, creatine; Cho, choline) in the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in patients with stable schizophrenia. Fifty patients with schizophrenia, treated with constant antipsychotics doses, in stable clinical condition were randomly assigned to administration of sarcosine (25 patients) or placebo (25 patients) for six months. Metabolite concentrations in DLPFC were assessed with 1.5 Tesla 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Clinical symptoms were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The first spectroscopy revealed no differences in metabolite concentrations between groups. After six months, NAA/Cho, mI/Cr and mI/Cho ratios in the left DLPFC were significantly higher in the sarcosine than the placebo group. In the sarcosine group, NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, mI/Cr, mI/Cho ratios also significantly increased compared to baseline values. In the placebo group, only the NAA/Cr ratio increased. The addition of sarcosine to antipsychotic therapy for six months increased markers of neurons viability (NAA) and neurogilal activity (mI) with simultaneous improvement of clinical symptoms. Sarcosine, two grams administered daily, seems to be an effective adjuvant in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia.},

Reported effects included improved mood, cognition, and creativity, which often served to counteract symptoms especially from conditions of anxiety and depression. There were also reports of various challenges with psychedelic microdosing, and some did not find the practice worth continuing.Conclusion:The study obtained evidence of a group of users taking small doses of psychedelics not for the purpose of intoxication but to enhance everyday functioning.

	abstract = {Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a non-selective serotonin-receptor agonist that was first synthesized in 1938 and identified as (potently) psychoactive in 1943. Psychedelics have been used by indigenous cultures for millennia [1]; however, because of LSD's unique potency and the timing of its discovery (coinciding with a period of major discovery in psychopharmacology), it is generally regarded as the quintessential contemporary psychedelic [2]. LSD has profound modulatory effects on consciousness and was used extensively in psychological research and psychiatric practice in the 1950s and 1960s [3]. In spite of this, however, there have been no modern human imaging studies of its acute effects on the brain. Here we studied the effects of LSD on intrinsic functional connectivity within the human brain using fMRI. High-level association cortices (partially overlapping with the default-mode, salience, and frontoparietal attention networks) and the thalamus showed increased global connectivity under the drug. The cortical areas showing increased global connectivity overlapped significantly with a map of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor densities (the key site of action of psychedelic drugs [4]). LSD also increased global integration by inflating the level of communication between normally distinct brain networks. The increase in global connectivity observed under LSD correlated with subjective reports of "ego dissolution." The present results provide the first evidence that LSD selectively expands global connectivity in the brain, compromising the brain's modular and "rich-club" organization and, simultaneously, the perceptual boundaries between the self and the environment.},

Since then, it was used as a popular and notorious substance of abuse in various parts of the world. Its beneficial role as an adjunct to psychotherapy was much unknown, until some ‘benevolent’ experiments were carried out over time to explore some of its potential uses. But, many of its effects were unclear and seemed to be a psychedelic enigma. In this review article, we have described the receptor pharmacology, mechanism of action, effects and adverse effects of LSD on the normal body system. We have also highlighted its addictive potentials and the chances of developing tolerance. We have assimilated some of the interesting therapeutic uses of this drug, such as an antianxiety agent, a creativity enhancer, a suggestibility enhancer, and a performance enhancer. We have also described LSD to be successfully used in drug and alcohol dependence, and as a part of psychedelic peak therapy in terminally ill patients. The relevant chronological history and literature in the light of present knowledge and scenarios have been discussed. Based on available evidence, LSD could be tried therapeutically in certain specific conditions under controlled settings. But as we mention, due to all the safety concerns, the use of this nonaddictive ‘entheogen’ in actual practice warrants a lot of expertise, caution, cooperation and ethical considerations.},

	abstract = {The involvement of the serotonin system in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia has been elucidated by experiments with hallucinogens. Application of a hallucinogen to humans leads to changes in perception, cognition, emotions, and induction of psychotic-like symptoms that resemble symptoms of schizophrenia. In rodent studies, their acute administration affects sensorimotor gating, locomotor activity, social behavior, and cognition including working memory, the phenotypes are considered as an animal model of schizophrenia. The complexity and singularity of human cognition raises questions about the validity of animal models utilizing agonists of 5-HT2A receptors. The present study thus investigated the effect of psilocin on memory acquisition, reinforced retrieval, and memory consolidation in rats. Psilocin is a main metabolite of psilocybin acting as an agonist at 5-HT2A receptors with a contribution of 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptors. First, we tested the effect of psilocin on the acquisition of a Carousel maze, a spatial task requiring navigation using distal cues, attention, and cognitive coordination. Psilocin significantly impaired the acquisition of the Carousel maze at both doses (1 and 4 mg/kg). The higher dose of psilocin blocked the learning processes even in an additional session when the rats received only saline. Next, we examined the effect of psilocin on reinforced retrieval and consolidation in the Morris water maze (MWM). The dose of 4 mg/kg disrupted reinforced retrieval in the MWM. However, the application of a lower dose was without any significant effect. Finally, neither the low nor high dose of psilocin injected post-training caused a deficit in memory consolidation in the MWM. Taken together, the psilocin dose dependently impaired the acquisition of the Carousel maze and reinforced retrieval in MWM; however, it had no effect on memory consolidation.},

	abstract = {All modern clinical studies using the classic hallucinogen lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in healthy subjects or patients in the last 25 years are reviewed herein. There were five recent studies in healthy participants and one in patients. In a controlled setting, LSD acutely induced bliss, audiovisual synesthesia, altered meaning of perceptions, derealization, depersonalization, and mystical experiences. These subjective effects of LSD were mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor. LSD increased feelings of closeness to others, openness, trust, and suggestibility. LSD impaired the recognition of sad and fearful faces, reduced left amygdala reactivity to fearful faces, and enhanced emotional empathy. LSD increased the emotional response to music and the meaning of music. LSD acutely produced deficits in sensorimotor gating, similar to observations in schizophrenia. LSD had weak autonomic stimulant effects and elevated plasma cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin levels. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance studies showed that LSD acutely reduced the integrity of functional brain networks and increased connectivity between networks that normally are more dissociated. LSD increased functional thalamocortical connectivity and functional connectivity of the primary visual cortex with other brain areas. The latter effect was correlated with subjective hallucinations. LSD acutely induced global increases in brain entropy that were associated with greater trait openness 14 days later. In patients with anxiety associated with life-threatening disease, anxiety was reduced for 2 months after two doses of LSD. In medical settings, no complications of LSD administration were observed. These data should contribute to further investigations of the therapeutic potential of LSD in psychiatry.},

	abstract = {Dopaminergic anti-parkinsonian medications, such as levodopa (LD) cause drug-induced dyskinesias (DID) in majority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Mucuna pruriens, a legume extensively used in Ayurveda to treat PD, is reputed to provide anti-parkinsonian benefits without inducing DID. We compared the behavioral effects of chronic parenteral administration of a water extract of M. pruriens seed powder (MPE) alone without any additives, MPE combined with the peripheral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI) benserazide (MPE+BZ), LD+BZ and LD alone without BZ in the hemiparkinsonian rat model of PD. A battery of behavioral tests assessed by blinded investigators served as outcome measures in these randomized trials. In experiment 1, animals that received LD+BZ or MPE+BZ at high (6mg/kg) and medium (4mg/kg) equivalent doses demonstrated significant alleviation of parkinsonism, but, developed severe dose-dependent DID. LD+BZ at low doses (2mg/kg) did not provide significant alleviation of parkinsonism. In contrast, MPE+BZ at an equivalent low dose significantly ameliorated parkinsonism. In experiment 2, MPE without any additives (12mg/kg and 20mg/kg LD equivalent dose) alleviated parkinsonism with significantly less DID compared to LD+BZ or MPE+BZ. In experiment 3, MPE without additives administered chronically provided long-term anti-parkinsonian benefits without causing DID. In experiment 4, MPE alone provided significantly more behavioral benefit when compared to the equivalent dose of synthetic LD alone without BZ. In experiment 5, MPE alone reduced the severity of DID in animals initially primed with LD+BZ. These findings suggest that M. pruriens contains water-soluble ingredients that either have an intrinsic DDCI-like activity or mitigate the need for an add-on DDCI to ameliorate parkinsonism. These unique long-term anti-parkinsonian effects of a parenterally administered water extract of M. pruriens seed powder may provide a platform for future drug discoveries and novel treatment strategies in PD.},

	doi = {10.1097/JSM.0b013e3181b8b52f},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study investigated resting concentrations of selected androgens after 3 weeks of creatine supplementation in male rugby players. It was hypothesized that the ratio of dihydrotestosterone (DHT, a biologically more active androgen) to testosterone (T) would change with creatine supplementation.
DESIGN: Double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study with a 6-week washout period.
SETTING: Rugby Institute in South Africa.
PARTICIPANTS: College-aged rugby players (n = 20) volunteered for the study, which took place during the competitive season.
INTERVENTIONS: Subjects loaded with creatine (25 g/day creatine with 25 g/day glucose) or placebo (50 g/day glucose) for 7 days followed by 14 days of maintenance (5 g/day creatine with 25 g/day glucose or 30 g/day glucose placebo).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum T and DHT were measured and ratio calculated at baseline and after 7 days and 21 days of creatine supplementation (or placebo). Body composition measurements were taken at each time point.
RESULTS: After 7 days of creatine loading, or a further 14 days of creatine maintenance dose, serum T levels did not change. However, levels of DHT increased by 56\% after 7 days of creatine loading and remained 40\% above baseline after 14 days maintenance (P {\textless} 0.001). The ratio of DHT:T also increased by 36\% after 7 days creatine supplementation and remained elevated by 22\% after the maintenance dose (P {\textless} 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Creatine supplementation may, in part, act through an increased rate of conversion of T to DHT. Further investigation is warranted as a result of the high frequency of individuals using creatine supplementation and the long-term safety of alterations in circulating androgen composition. STATEMENT OF CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although creatine is a widely used ergogenic aid, the mechanisms of action are incompletely understood, particularly in relation to dihydrotestosterone, and therefore the long-term clinical safety cannot be guaranteed.},

The nootropic affects the brain performances through number of mechanisms or pathways, for example, dopaminergic pathway. Previous researches have reported the influence of nootropics on treating memory disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Those disorders are observed to impair the same pathways of the nootropics. Thus, recent established nootropics are designed sensitively and effectively towards the pathways.

	abstract = {Extracts of Hypericum perforatum L. (St John's wort) are now successfully competing for status as a standard antidepressant therapy. Because of this, great effort has been devoted to identifying the active antidepressant compounds in the extract. From a phytochemical point of view, St John's wort is one of the best-investigated medicinal plants. A series of bioactive compounds has been detected in the crude material, namely flavonol derivatives, biflavones, proanthocyanidines, xanthones, phloroglucinols and naphthodianthrones. Although St John's wort has been subjected to extensive scientific studies in the last decade, there are still many open questions about its pharmacology and mechanism of action. Initial biochemical studies reported that St John's wort is only a weak inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-A and -B activity but that it inhibits the synaptosomal uptake of serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) with approximately equal affinity. However, other in vitro binding assays carried out using St John's wort extract demonstrated significant affinity for adenosine, GABA(A), GABA(B) and glutamate receptors. In vivo St John's wort extract leads to a downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors and an upregulation of serotonin 5-HT(2) receptors in the rat frontal cortex and causes changes in neurotransmitter concentrations in brain areas that are implicated in depression. In studies using the rat forced swimming test, an animal model of depression, St John's wort extracts induced a significant reduction of immobility. In other experimental models of depression, including acute and chronic forms of escape deficit induced by stressors, St John's wort extract was shown to protect rats from the consequences of unavoidable stress. Recent neuroendocrine studies suggest that St John's wort is involved in the regulation of genes that control hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. With regard to the antidepressant effects of St John's wort extract, many of the pharmacological activities appear to be attributable to the naphthodianthrone hypericin, the phloroglucinol derivative hyperforin and several flavonoids. This review integrates new findings of possible mechanisms that may underlie the antidepressant action of St John's wort and its active constituents with a large body of existing literature.},

Fat-free and whole milk significantly reduced the head-, mouth-, and nose-space concentrations of all volatiles. Water was the major component in milk responsible for the deodorization of volatiles. Due to its higher fat content, whole milk was more effective than fat-free milk in the deodorization of the more hydrophobic volatiles diallyl disulfide and allyl methyl disulfide. Milk was more effective than water and 10\% sodium caseinate in the deodorization of allyl methyl sulfide, a persistent garlic odor, in the mouth after garlic ingestion. Addition of milk to garlic before ingestion had a higher deodorizing effect on the volatiles in the mouth than drinking milk after consuming garlic. Practical Application: Ingesting beverages or foods with high water and/or fat content such as milk may help reduce the malodorous odor in breath after garlic ingestion and mask the garlic flavor during eating. To enhance the deodorizing effect, deodorant foods should be mixed with garlic before ingestion.},

The present study aimed to compare the modulatory effects of garlic, ginger, turmeric and their mixture on the metabolic syndrome and oxidative stress in streptozotocin (STZ)-nicotinamide diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in overnight fasted rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (65 mg/kg body weight) and nicotinamide (110 mg/kg body weight, 15 min before STZ injection). Diabetic rats orally received either distilled water (as vehicle) or 200 mg/kg body weight of garlic bulb, ginger rhizome or turmeric rhizome powder suspension separately or mixed together (GGT mixture) for twenty-eight consecutive days. The results showed that these spices and their mixture significantly alleviated (80-97 \%, P {\textless} 0·05-0·001) signs of the metabolic syndrome (hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia), the elevation in atherogenic indices and cellular toxicity in STZ-nicotinamide diabetic rats by increasing the production of insulin (26-37 \%), enhancing the antioxidant defence system (31-52 \%, especially GSH) and decreasing lipid peroxidation (60-97 \%). The greatest modulation was seen in diabetic rats that received garlic and the GGT mixture (10-23 \% more than that in the ginger and turmeric groups). In conclusion, garlic or the mix including garlic appears to have an impact on each of the measures more effectively than ginger and turmeric and may have a role in alleviating the risks of the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular complications.},

	abstract = {Aim:
The present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of supplementation of garlic, ginger and their combination in the diets of broiler chickens and assessment in terms of feed intake, growth performance and economics of feeding.

Materials and Methods:
A total of 240 1-day-old Cobb-400 broiler chicks were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments each with three replicates of 20 chicks per replicate (n=60). Four experimental diets were formulated in such a way that control diet (T1) contained neither ginger nor garlic. While, birds in group T2 and T3 were fed with diets containing 1\% garlic and ginger, respectively. Diet 4 (T4 group) contained a combination of 1\% of garlic and ginger. The feeding experiment was carried out for 42 days, and different parameters evaluated includes feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion ratio, gut morphometry, and economics of feeding in terms of return over feed cost (ROFC) and European Performance Efficiency Index.

Results:
Feed intake of experimental birds in ginger and mixture of garlic and ginger supplemented groups, i.e., T3 and T4 groups have significantly (p{\textless}0.05) higher feed intake as compared to control. While, feeding of garlic have non-significant effect on feed intake as compared to other groups. A body weight gain (g/bird) was found to be significantly (p{\textless}0.05) higher in garlic (T2 group) and ginger (T3 group) supplemented group as compare to control and garlic and ginger mixture supplemented group (T4 group). Feed conversion ratio was significantly (p{\textless}0.05) lower in ginger (T3 group) supplemented group as compare to other groups. Mean villi length, villi width and cryptal depth were significantly (p{\textless}0.05) higher in T3 group than rest of all three groups, indicating increased absorptive surface area. ROFC was significantly (p{\textless}0.05) lower in T3 and T4 groups as compare to control. However, it was not significantly different between control and T2 group.

Conclusion:
On the basis of the results of the study, it is concluded that supplementation of garlic improves the performance of broilers when added at the rate of 1\% of broiler ration and can be a viable alternative to antibiotic growth promoter in the feeding of broiler chicken.},

For example, increased understanding of mechanisms underlying cholinergic modulation of cortical function has provided insight into attentional dysfunction in schizophrenia. Acetylcholine normally enhances cortical sensitivity to external stimuli and decreases corticocortical communication, increasing focused attention. However, increases in ACh signaling can lead to symptoms related to anxiety and depression. For example, while stress-induced ACh release can result in adaptive responses to environmental stimuli, chronic elevations in cholinergic signaling may produce maladaptive behaviors. Here, we review several innovations in human imaging, molecular genetics and physiological control of circuits that have begun to identify mechanisms linking altered cholinergic neuromodulation to schizophrenia and depression.},

After preincubation of the cells for 2 h at room temperature (RT) as well as at 37 degrees C, NAC was found to enhance histamine release also when induced by compound 48/80. Both fluoride treatment and prolonged incubation at 37 degrees C (but not at RT) for 2 h decreased the ATP content of the cells. NAC was found to counteract the fall in ATP caused by prolonged incubation of the cells at 37 degrees C but not when induced by exposure to sodium fluoride. The results do not favor the concept that free radicals generated by fluoride treatment are responsible for the subsequent sensitivity of the cells to the secretory action of calcium. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that free radicals generated during prolonged incubation of the cells at 37 degrees C might be involved in the decrease of the sensitivity of the cells to the secretory action of the fluoride-calcium system and of compound 48/80. This is supported by the finding that the presence of NAC not only activated the secretory response but also counteracted the decrease of the cellular ATP content noted following preincubation of the cells for 2 h at 37 degrees C.},

Recent experimental findings have demonstrated that creatine affords significant neuroprotection against ischemic and oxidative insults. The present experiments investigated the possible effect of creatine dietary supplementation on brain tissue damage after experimental traumatic brain injury. Results demonstrate that chronic administration of creatine ameliorated the extent of cortical damage by as much as 36\% in mice and 50\% in rats. Protection seems to be related to creatine-induced maintenance of mitochondrial bioenergetics. Mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly increased, intramitochondrial levels of reactive oxygen species and calcium were significantly decreased, and adenosine triphosphate levels were maintained. Induction of mitochondrial permeability transition was significantly inhibited in animals fed creatine. This food supplement may provide clues to the mechanisms responsible for neuronal loss after traumatic brain injury and may find use as a neuroprotective agent against acute and delayed neurodegenerative processes.},

Thirty-eight male Sprague Dawley rats were used. Rats were divided into four groups: Group I: referred as Control group, received corn oil only; Group II: as DIM-10, rats received 10 mg kg-1 DIM; Group III: as DIM-50, rats received 50 mg kg-1 DIM; Group IV: as DIM-100, received 100 mg kg-1 DIM during 53 days. Spermatological parameters, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels of testes and serum T and E2 levels were assayed. Histopathological examinations of tests were done. DIM caused an increase in MDA levels. It decreased motility and live sperm rates and increased degeneration of testicular tissues. While DIM-10 did not affect abnormal sperm rate, higher concentrations increased the abnormalities. Sperm density was higher in DIM-10 groups when compared to both other groups. Only DIM-50 had an anti-androgenic effect among all groups. Only, DIM-10 showed anti-estrogenic activity as compared to higher DIM groups. In conclusion, DIM (i) had side effect on some sperm characteristics, (ii) increased the MDA levels and (iii) led to histological degeneration of testicular tissues and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner.},

Antineoplastic effects of cruciferous vegetables are attributable to bioactive indoles, most prominently, 3, 3’-diindolylmethane (DIM). In addition to effects on proliferation and apoptosis, DIM acts as an antiandrogen in prostate cancer cell lines. This study characterized the effects of prostatic DIM on the androgen receptor (AR) in patients with prostate cancer. Men with localized prostate cancer were treated with a specially formulated DIM capsule designed for enhanced bioavailability (BR-DIM) at a dose of 225 mg orally twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. DIM levels and AR activity were assessed at the time of prostatectomy. Out of 28 evaluable patients, 26 (93\%) had detectable prostatic DIM levels, with a mean concentration of 14.2 ng/gm. The mean DIM plasma level on BR-DIM therapy was 9.0 ng/mL; levels were undetectable at baseline and in follow-up samples. AR localization in the prostate was assessed with immunohistochemistry. After BR-DIM therapy, 96\% of patients exhibited exclusion of the AR from the cell nucleus. In contrast, in prostate biopsy samples obtained prior to BR-DIM therapy, no patient exhibited AR nuclear exclusion. Declines in PSA were observed in a majority of patients (71\%). Compliance was excellent and toxicity was minimal. In summary, BR-DIM treatment resulted in reliable prostatic DIM levels and anti-androgenic biologic effects at well tolerated doses. These results support further investigation of BR-DIM as a chemopreventive and therapeutic agent in prostate cancer.},

As a result, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists are currently being tested as potential anti-depressants. The current study was designed to test the efficacy of mifepristone, a GR antagonist, in mitigating behavioral, neuroendocrine and central nervous system (CNS) responses to an acute stressor. Adult male rats were treated for 5 days with mifepristone (10 mg/kg) and then exposed to the forced swim test (FST). Treatment with mifepristone decreased immobility and increased swimming (but not climbing) behavior in the FST, consistent with anti-depressant action. In addition, mifepristone dampened the ACTH response to FST exposure. In the CNS, mifepristone increased c-Fos expression in all subdivisions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and decreased neuronal activity in some subdivisions of the hippocampus including the CA2, CA3, and hilus region of the dentate gyrus in animals exposed to FST. In contrast, mifepristone increased neuronal activity in the ventral subiculum (output region of the hippocampus) and decreased c-Fos expression in the central amygdala (CeA) in animals exposed to FST. These data suggest that anti-depressant efficacy and perhaps HPA dampening properties of RU486 are related to alterations in key limbic circuits mediating CNS stress responses, resulting in enhanced stress inhibition (via the mPFC and ventral subiculum) as well as decreased stress excitation (central amygdala). Overall the data suggest that drugs targeting the glucocorticoid receptor may ameliorate stress dysfunction associated with depressive illness.},

Earlier we showed that administration of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone during the final 4 days of a 21 days period of corticosterone treatment fully normalized the number of newborn cells. Here we aimed to better understand how mifepristone achieves this effect and questioned whether an even shorter (single day) mifepristone treatment (instead of 4 days) also suffices to normalize neurogenesis. Methods We investigated various steps of the neurogenic process, using the immunohistochemical markers BrdU, doublecortin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen as well as glial fibrillary acidic protein, after 17 or 21 days of corticosterone (versus vehicle) treatment. Results Corticosterone primarily attenuates the proliferation of cells which subsequently develop into neurons; this is fully reversed by mifepristone. Surprisingly, the corticosteroid effects on neurogenesis can even be fully re-set by a single-day treatment with mifepristone (on day 18), despite the continued corticosterone exposure on subsequent days. Conclusions Our results emphasize that studies into the therapeutical efficacy of new antidepressants, especially those targeting HPA-activity or the glucocorticoid receptor, should explore the possibility to reduce treatment duration.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of severe psychiatric illnesses are complex, involving multiple neuronal and neurochemical pathways. A growing body of evidence indicates that alterations in hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis function may be a trait marker in both mood disorders and psychosis, and may exert significant causal and exacerbating effects on symptoms and neurocognition. At present, however, no available treatments preferentially target HPA axis abnormalities, although many drugs do increase feedback-regulation of the HPA axis at the level of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This action may in part underpin their therapeutic efficacy. Therapeutic interventions directly targeted at GR function may therefore have clinical benefit. The present review examines the current literature for the clinical utility of GR antagonists (specifically mifepristone) in mood disorders and psychosis. At present, most studies are at the “proof-of-concept” stage, although the results of preliminary, randomized, controlled trials are encouraging. The optimum strategy for the clinical application of GR antagonists is yet to be established, their potential role as first-line or adjunctive treatments being unclear. The therapeutic utility of such drugs will become known within the next few years following the results of larger clinical trials currently underway.},

Here, we hypothesize that stresses (defined as homeostatic disturbances) can induce low-grade inflammation by increasing the availability of water, sodium, and energy-rich substances to meet the increased metabolic demand induced by the stressor. One way of triggering low-grade inflammation is by increasing intestinal barrier permeability through activation of various components of the stress system. Although beneficial to meet the demands necessary during stress, increased intestinal barrier permeability also raises the possibility of the translocation of bacteria and their toxins across the intestinal lumen into the blood circulation. In combination with modern life-style factors, the increase in bacteria/bacterial toxin translocation arising from a more permeable intestinal wall causes a low-grade inflammatory state. We support this hypothesis with numerous studies finding associations with NCDs and markers of endotoxemia, suggesting that this process plays a pivotal and perhaps even a causal role in the development of low-grade inflammation and its related diseases.},

Animals had access to a running wheel, were treated with the antidepressant, or received both conditions combined. Control mice received no running wheel and no drug treatment. Exercise resulted in asymmetric changes in the adrenal glands. Whereas sedentary mice had larger left adrenals than right ones, this situation was abolished in exercising animals, mainly due to enlargement of the right adrenal cortex. However, antidepressant treatment alone was ineffective whereas the combination of antidepressant treatment and exercise resulted in an enlargement of both adrenal cortices. In these respective conditions, the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA expression in the left and right adrenal medullas varied greatly in parallel to the changes observed in the adrenal cortex sizes. TH mRNA expression in the locus coeruleus of exercising mice was significantly increased irrespective of concomitant tianeptine treatment. Corticotrophin-releasing factor mRNA levels in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus were decreased after voluntary exercise but were unaffected by tianeptine. Exercise, particularly in combination with tianeptine treatment, resulted in decreased early morning baseline plasma levels of corticosterone. If animals were exposed to novelty (i.e. a mild psychological stressor), a decreased response in plasma corticosterone levels was observed in the exercising mice. By contrast, after restraint, a mixed physical and psychological stressor, exercising mice showed an enhanced response in plasma corticosterone compared to the controls; a response which was even further boosted in exercising mice concomitantly treated with tianeptine. Under either condition, plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone levels were not different between groups. Thus, voluntary exercise impacts substantially on HPA axis regulation. Concurrent tianeptine treatment results in synergistic actions, mainly at the adrenal level, affecting both its structure and function.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Inflammatory mediators are key players in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) and bone destruction. Conventional drugs suppress symptomatic activity and have no therapeutic influence on disease. Cissus quadrangularis and Withania somnifera are widely used for the treatment of bone fractures and wounds; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulated by these herbals are still unclear.

Methods
We established an in vitro OA culture model by exposing human chondrocytes to proinflammatory cytokine and interleukin (IL)-1β for 36 hours prior to treatment with the herbals: C. quadrangularis, W. somnifera, and the combination of the two herbals. Cell viability, toxicity, and gene expression of OA modifying agents were examined. In addition, expression of survivin, which is crucial for cell growth, was analyzed. In vivo work on osteotomized rats studied the bone and cartilage regenerative effects of C. quadrangularis, W. somnifera, and the combination therapy.

Results
Exposure of chondrocytes to IL-1β induced significant toxicity and cell death. However, herbal treatment alleviated IL-1β induced cell toxicity and upregulated cell growth and proliferation. C. quadrangularis inhibited gene expression of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, known to aggravate cartilage and bone destruction, and augmented expression of survivin by inhibiting p38 MAPK. Interestingly, osteotomized rats treated with C. quadrangularis drastically enhanced alkaline phosphatase and cartilage tissue formation as compared to untreated, W. somnifera only, or the combination of both herbals.

Conclusion
Our findings demonstrate for the first time the signaling mechanisms regulated by C. quadrangularis and W. somnifera in OA and osteogenesis. We suggest that the chondroprotective effects and regenerative ability of these herbals are via the upregulation of survivin that exerts inhibitory effects on the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. These findings thus validate C. quadrangularis as a potential therapeutic for rheumatic disorders.},

	abstract = {Treatment of Parkinson patients with L-DOPA (3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine) leads to endproduct inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase, the key enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis and the enzyme needing tetrahydrobiopterin and iron as cofactors. To overcome this problem an alternative treatment was investigated which attempted to stimulate endogenous dopamine biosynthesis. Incubation of rat PC 12 cells with NADH (beta-nicotinamide adeninedinucleotide) leads to increased dopamine production. We investigated the possibility that this increase of dopamine biosynthesis was due to stimulation of quinonoid dihydropteridine reductase, the enzyme which recycles the inactive dihydrobiopterin to the active tetrahydrobiopterin. The experiments showed that whereas NADH is able to increase dopamine production in PC 12 cells (rat phaeochromocytoma cells, clone PC 12) up to three-fold, no influence is exerted by NADH on pteridine metabolism; neither are tetrahydrobiopterin concentrations nor the de novo-biosynthesis of pteridines from guanosine triphosphate altered by NADH. Further no influence of NADH on protein de novo synthesis of quinonoid dihydropteridine reductase was observed. However, NADH was able to directly increase the catalytic activity of this enzyme. Our results suggest that the stimulation of dopamine biosynthesis by NADH is due to more rapid regeneration of quinonoid dihydrobiopterin to tetrahydrobiopterin.},

NADH has been reported to relieve some of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, presumably by altering dopaminergic function. The present study examines the efficacy of NADH in influencing DA activity in the rat striatum. In striatal slices, NADH (350 microM) significantly increased basal DA and DOPAC efflux and caused a 2-fold increase in the DA overflow evoked by high KCl (25 mM). Tissue levels of BH(4), basal BH(4) efflux, and KCl-evoked BH(4) overflow were unaffected by NADH, as was [(3)H]DA uptake into striatal synaptosomes. In contrast to the effects of NADH on DA function in vitro, no effects were observed when NADH was administered systemically. NADH (10 or 100 mg/kg, s.c.) did not influence the tissue content of DA, 5-HT, or their metabolites in the midbrain or striatum, nor did it alter DA extracellular concentrations. These results indicate that NADH can increase DA release from striatal slices, although we are as yet unable to detect this effect in vivo.},

BEN increase was correlated to CBF reduction only in several regions (−0.5 {\textless} r {\textless} −0.4), indicating a neuronal nature for most of the observed BEN alterations.

	abstract = {Human intelligence comprises comprehension of and reasoning about an infinitely variable external environment. A brain capable of large variability in neural configurations, or states, will more easily understand and predict variable external events. Entropy measures the variety of configurations possible within a system, and recently the concept of brain entropy has been defined as the number of neural states a given brain can access. This study investigates the relationship between human intelligence and brain entropy, to determine whether neural variability as reflected in neuroimaging signals carries information about intellectual ability. We hypothesize that intelligence will be positively associated with entropy in a sample of 892 healthy adults, using resting-state fMRI. Intelligence is measured with the Shipley Vocabulary and WASI Matrix Reasoning tests. Brain entropy was positively associated with intelligence. This relation was most strongly observed in the prefrontal cortex, inferior temporal lobes, and cerebellum. This relationship between high brain entropy and high intelligence indicates an essential role for entropy in brain functioning. It demonstrates that access to variable neural states predicts complex behavioral performance, and specifically shows that entropy derived from neuroimaging signals at rest carries information about intellectual capacity. Future work in this area may elucidate the links between brain entropy in both resting and active states and various forms of intelligence. This insight has the potential to provide predictive information about adaptive behavior and to delineate the subdivisions and nature of intelligence based on entropic patterns.},

With emphasis on L-tryptophan’s role in synthesis of brain serotonin, details are provided on the research uses of L-tryptophan, particularly L-tryptophan depletion, and on clinical trials that have been conducted using L-tryptophan supplementation. The ability to change the rates of serotonin synthesis in the brain by manipulating concentrations of serum tryptophan is the foundation of much research. As the sole precursor of serotonin, experimental research has shown that L-tryptophan’s role in brain serotonin synthesis is an important factor involved in mood, behavior, and cognition. Furthermore, clinical trials have provided some initial evidence of L-tryptophan’s efficacy for treatment of psychiatric disorders, particularly when used in combination with other therapeutic agents.},

She walks down the stairs
with dignity and no rush at all
Her appearance makes you gasp'n'stare,
her presence makes you feel like you'd crawl
She takes a look around the place
makes the other ladies feel disgraced
She takes a drink and stands
you just can't take your eyes off her figure,
she laughs with her friend who ain't a man
now you're getting so, so eager
it's time to try your luck again
but remember what I say

It's gotta be the real thing
for that lady
she ain't here for any faking

You tell her something sweet for starters
already you know it didn't sound too good
You start to dream about her caress 'n'
try so hard to get her hooked
you prove yourself but she looks away
remember what I said

It's gotta be the real thing
for that lady
she ain't here for any faking


The lady, you know, she is the earth
understand and she'll make it worth
she's the swan (s-van) where we all come from
the most beautiful and healthy one(*)
give the Lady but be sincere
she'll give you much of what you need
take her as a self-evidence
you know she'll slap you in your face
and as the gardeners of this plan (-et)
I think by now we all understand (stand under?)
The two of a kind they need a rest
remember what I said:

It's gotta be the real (reel) thing
for that lady

Here, we subjected 7-week old CD-1 wild type male mice to intermittent (alternate-day) fasting or high fat diet (45\% caloric supplied by fat) for 11 months. Mice on intermittent fasting had better learning and memory assessed by the Barnes maze and fear conditioning, thicker CA1 pyramidal cell layer, higher expression of drebrin, a dendritic protein, and lower oxidative stress than mice that had free access to regular diet (control mice). Mice fed with high fat diet was obese and with hyperlipidemia. They also had poorer exercise tolerance. However, these obese mice did not present significant learning and memory impairment or changes in brain structures or oxidative stress compared with control mice. These results suggest that intermittent fasting improves brain functions and structures and that high fat diet feeding started early in life does not cause significant changes in brain functions and structures in obese middle-aged animals.},

	abstract = {Background
A substantial body of evidence amassed from epidemiologic, correlative and experimental studies strongly associates atherosclerotic vascular disease (AVD) with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Depending on the precise interrelationship between AVD and AD, systematic application of interventions to maintain vascular health and function as a component of standard AD therapy offers the prospect of mitigating what is presently the inexorable course of dementia. To assess this hypothesis it is vital to rigorously establish the measures of AVD that are most strongly associated with an AD diagnosis.

Methods
A precise neuropathological diagnosis was established for all subjects using a battery of genetic, clinical, and histological methods. The severity of atherosclerosis in the circle of Willis (CW) was quantified by direct digitized measurement of arterial occlusion in postmortem specimens and compared between AD and non-demented control (NDC) groups by calculating a corresponding index of occlusion.

Results
Atherosclerotic occlusion of the CW arteries was more extensive in the AD group than the NDC group. Statistically significant differences were also observed between control and AD groups with regard to Braak stage, total plaque score, total NFT score, total white matter rarefaction score, brain weight, MMSE scores and apolipoprotein E allelic frequencies.

Conclusions
Our results, combined with a consideration of the multifaceted impacts of impaired cerebral circulation, suggest an immediate need for prospective clinical trials to assess the efficacy of AD prevention using anti-atherosclerotic agents.},

More than 77\% of subjects with Alzheimer's disease had grossly apparent circle of Willis atherosclerosis, a percentage that was significantly higher than normal (47\%), or other neurodegenerative diseases (43-67\%). Age- and sex-adjusted atherosclerosis ratings were highly correlated with neuritic plaque, paired helical filaments tau neurofibrillary tangle and cerebral amyloid angiopathy ratings in the whole sample and within individual groups. We found no associations between atherosclerosis ratings and Î±-synuclein or TDP-43 lesion ratings. The association between age-adjusted circle of Willis atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease-type pathology was more robust for female subjects than male subjects. These results provide further confirmation and specificity that vascular disease and Alzheimer's disease are interrelated and suggest that common aetiologic or reciprocally synergistic pathophysiological mechanisms promote both vascular pathology and plaque and tangle pathology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that vascular risk factors (VRF) contribute to cognitive decline. Whether their treatment can slow down the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) remains unsettled. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate whether the treatment of VRF is associated with a slower cognitive decline in patients who have AD without cerebrovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: We recruited 301 consecutive patients who had AD without CVD (mean age 71.7 years; 69.4\% women; first Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] mean score 21.6; mean follow-up 2.3 years), who had attended a memory clinic between 1997 and 2003. VRF sought were high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, and atherosclerotic disease. Only 21 patients (7.0\%) had no VRF. Others were classified as having no VRF treated (n = 72; 25.7\%), some VRF treated (n = 119; 42.5\%), or all VRF treated (n = 89; 31.8\%). We compared MMSE progression over time among these 3 groups using a mixed random effects regression model.
RESULTS: Baseline MMSE scores were similar in the 3 groups. With adjustment for confounding factors, MMSE progression over time differed significantly between groups (p = 0.002). Patients with all their VRF treated declined less than those with none of their VRF treated. Those with some VRF treated tended to have an intermediate decline.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients who have Alzheimer disease without CVD, treatment of vascular risk factors (VRF) is associated with a slower decline in Mini-Mental State Examination score. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this association, but our data suggest that dementia should not prevent treatment of VRF.},

In regions that participate in higher cognitive function, middle temporal, posterior cingulate, inferior parietal and precuneus regions, and neuroimaging studies indicate an association involving VRFs, cerebral hypoperfusion, and cognitive decline in elderly individuals who develop AD. The VRF can be present in cognitively intact individuals for decades before mild cognitive deficits or neuropathological signs are manifested. In that sense, they may be "ticking time bombs" before cognitive function is demolished. Preventive intervention of modifiable VRF may delay or block progression of AD. Intervention could target cerebral blood flow (CBF), since most VRFs act to lower CBF in aging individuals by promoting cerebrovascular dysfunction.},

The paper then considers evidence that saturated fat and simple carbohydrate intake is correlated with neurobiological changes in the hippocampus that may be related to the ability of these dietary components to impair cognitive function. Finally, a model is described proposing that Western diet consumption contributes to the development of excessive food intake and obesity, in part, by interfering with a type of hippocampal-dependent memory inhibition that is critical in the ability of animals to refrain from responding to environmental cues associated with food, and ultimately from consuming energy intake in excess of that driven solely by caloric need.},

	abstract = {Accumulation of toxic protein aggregates—amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles—is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Aβ accumulation has been hypothesized to result from an imbalance between Aβ production and clearance; indeed, Aβ clearance seems to be impaired in both early and late forms of AD. To develop efficient strategies to slow down or halt AD, it is critical to understand how Aβ is cleared from the brain. Extracellular Aβ deposits can be removed from the brain by various clearance systems, most importantly, transport across the blood–brain barrier. Findings from the past few years suggest that astroglial-mediated interstitial fluid (ISF) bulk flow, known as the glymphatic system, might contribute to a larger portion of extracellular Aβ (eAβ) clearance than previously thought. The meningeal lymphatic vessels, discovered in 2015, might provide another clearance route. Because these clearance systems act together to drive eAβ from the brain, any alteration to their function could contribute to AD. An understanding of Aβ clearance might provide strategies to reduce excess Aβ deposits and delay, or even prevent, disease onset. In this Review, we describe the clearance systems of the brain as they relate to proteins implicated in AD pathology, with the main focus on Aβ.},

The kinetics, compartmentation, and form of Aβ and its temporal relation to the neurodegenerative process remain uncertain. The levels of soluble and insoluble Aβ were determined by using western blot techniques, and the findings were assessed in relation to indices of severity of disease. The mean level of soluble Aβ is increased threefold in Alzheimer's disease and correlates highly with markers of disease severity. In contrast, the level of insoluble Aβ (also a measure of total amyloid load) is found only to discriminate Alzheimer's disease from controls, and does not correlate with disease severity or numbers of amyloid plaques. These findings support the concept of several interacting pools of Aβ, that is, a large relatively static insoluble pool that is derived from a constantly turning over smaller soluble pool. The latter may exist in both intracellular and extracellular compartments, and contain the basic forms of Aβ that cause neurodegeneration. Reducing the levels of these soluble Aβ species by threefold to levels found in normal controls might prove to be a goal of future therapeutic intervention.},

	abstract = {Biomarkers of brain Aβ amyloid deposition can be measured either by cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 or Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography imaging. Our objective was to evaluate the ability of Aβ load and neurodegenerative atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging to predict shorter time-to-progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia and to characterize the effect of these biomarkers on the risk of progression as they become increasingly abnormal. A total of 218 subjects with mild cognitive impairment were identified from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The primary outcome was time-to-progression to Alzheimer's dementia. Hippocampal volumes were measured and adjusted for intracranial volume. We used a new method of pooling cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 and Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography measures to produce equivalent measures of brain Aβ load from either source and analysed the results using multiple imputation methods. We performed our analyses in two phases. First, we grouped our subjects into those who were 'amyloid positive' (n = 165, with the assumption that Alzheimer's pathology is dominant in this group) and those who were 'amyloid negative' (n = 53). In the second phase, we included all 218 subjects with mild cognitive impairment to evaluate the biomarkers in a sample that we assumed to contain a full spectrum of expected pathologies. In a Kaplan-Meier analysis, amyloid positive subjects with mild cognitive impairment were much more likely to progress to dementia within 2 years than amyloid negative subjects with mild cognitive impairment (50 versus 19\%). Among amyloid positive subjects with mild cognitive impairment only, hippocampal atrophy predicted shorter time-to-progression (P {\textless} 0.001) while Aβ load did not (P = 0.44). In contrast, when all 218 subjects with mild cognitive impairment were combined (amyloid positive and negative), hippocampal atrophy and Aβ load predicted shorter time-to-progression with comparable power (hazard ratio for an inter-quartile difference of 2.6 for both); however, the risk profile was linear throughout the range of hippocampal atrophy values but reached a ceiling at higher values of brain Aβ load. Our results are consistent with a model of Alzheimer's disease in which Aβ deposition initiates the pathological cascade but is not the direct cause of cognitive impairment as evidenced by the fact that Aβ load severity is decoupled from risk of progression at high levels. In contrast, hippocampal atrophy indicates how far along the neurodegenerative path one is, and hence how close to progressing to dementia. Possible explanations for our finding that many subjects with mild cognitive impairment have intermediate levels of Aβ load include: (i) individual subjects may reach an Aβ load plateau at varying absolute levels; (ii) some subjects may be more biologically susceptible to Aβ than others; and (iii) subjects with mild cognitive impairment with intermediate levels of Aβ may represent individuals with Alzheimer's disease co-existent with other pathologies.},

	abstract = {Accumulation of amyloid beta protein (Aβ) plays a major role in the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ is generated from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). There are two factors that reduce of Aβ accumulation in the brain; degradation by peptidases such as neprilysin (NEP) and clearance via two transporters. The low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1) is the major transporter that clears Aβ from brain to blood and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a receptor that transports Aβ from blood to brain. Copper (Cu) has been postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of AD, especially involved in Aβ aggregation and toxicity. According to a recent study, Cu(II) could reduce Aβ clearance from the brain in cholesterol-fed rabbits. However, the critical mechanism is unclear. This study was purposed to demonstrate whether Cu (II) would alter accumulation of Aβ in brain. We treated 25 and 50 μM CuSO4 for 48-hour in the well-defined neurodevelopmental cell line (PC12), rat choroidal epithelial cell line (Z310), and rat brain endothelial cell line (RBE4) to estimate the effects on Cu(II) exposure in the brain.Cu(II) increased the levels of Aβ(40) and Aβ(42) in the PC12 cell medium in a dose-dependent manner compared with control. The mRNA and protein expression levels of APP and BACE1, which play an important role in Aβ generation, were increased in the PC12 cells exposed to Cu(II). NEP expression levels in mRNA and protein were decreased in a dose-dependent manner in PC12 cells treated with Cu(II). In the RBE4 cells, Cu(II) decreased LRP1 levels and increased RAGE levels in mRNA and protein compared with control. Moreover, Cu(II) decreased the clearance of Aβ using the blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport study. However, in the Z310 cells, Cu(II) didn’t change the levels of LRP1 and RAGE in mRNA and protein. These results implied that Cu(II) increased Aβ accumulation in the brain by increasing Aβ production but decreasing Aβ degradation in the brain parenchyma and interfering with clearance of Aβ via the BBB.},

Nearly 20 years ago, with the combination of observations from biochemistry, neuropathology and genetics, a compelling hypothesis known as the amyloid cascade hypothesis was formulated. The core of this hypothesis is that it is pathological accumulations of amyloid-Î², a peptide fragment of a membrane protein called amyloid precursor protein, that act as the root cause of AD and initiate its pathogenesis. Yet, with the passage of time, growing amounts of data have accumulated that are inconsistent with the basically linear structure of this hypothesis. And while there is fear in the field over the consequences of rejecting it outright, clinging to an inaccurate disease model is the option we should fear most. This Perspective explores the proposition that we are over-reliant on amyloid to define and diagnose AD and that the time has come to face our fears and reject the amyloid cascade hypothesis.},

After a review of the literature and survey of a sample of AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) CTs, the authors question whether problems of human error preclude AD researchers from continuing their dependence on rated outcome measures for CTs. The authors propose that the realities of AD, especially a probable irreversible progression of neuropathology prior to onset of clinical symptoms or signs capable of differentiating persons at risk for AD from normal aged, require AD investigators and clinicians to privilege biomarkers and encourage their development as surrogate targets for preventive AD treatment developments, testing, and use in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Background
A substantial body of evidence amassed from epidemiologic, correlative and experimental studies strongly associates atherosclerotic vascular disease (AVD) with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Depending on the precise interrelationship between AVD and AD, systematic application of interventions to maintain vascular health and function as a component of standard AD therapy offers the prospect of mitigating what is presently the inexorable course of dementia. To assess this hypothesis it is vital to rigorously establish the measures of AVD that are most strongly associated with an AD diagnosis.

Methods
A precise neuropathological diagnosis was established for all subjects using a battery of genetic, clinical, and histological methods. The severity of atherosclerosis in the circle of Willis (CW) was quantified by direct digitized measurement of arterial occlusion in postmortem specimens and compared between AD and non-demented control (NDC) groups by calculating a corresponding index of occlusion.

Results
Atherosclerotic occlusion of the CW arteries was more extensive in the AD group than the NDC group. Statistically significant differences were also observed between control and AD groups with regard to Braak stage, total plaque score, total NFT score, total white matter rarefaction score, brain weight, MMSE scores and apolipoprotein E allelic frequencies.

Conclusions
Our results, combined with a consideration of the multifaceted impacts of impaired cerebral circulation, suggest an immediate need for prospective clinical trials to assess the efficacy of AD prevention using anti-atherosclerotic agents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that vascular risk factors (VRF) contribute to cognitive decline. Whether their treatment can slow down the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) remains unsettled. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate whether the treatment of VRF is associated with a slower cognitive decline in patients who have AD without cerebrovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: We recruited 301 consecutive patients who had AD without CVD (mean age 71.7 years; 69.4\% women; first Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] mean score 21.6; mean follow-up 2.3 years), who had attended a memory clinic between 1997 and 2003. VRF sought were high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, and atherosclerotic disease. Only 21 patients (7.0\%) had no VRF. Others were classified as having no VRF treated (n = 72; 25.7\%), some VRF treated (n = 119; 42.5\%), or all VRF treated (n = 89; 31.8\%). We compared MMSE progression over time among these 3 groups using a mixed random effects regression model.
RESULTS: Baseline MMSE scores were similar in the 3 groups. With adjustment for confounding factors, MMSE progression over time differed significantly between groups (p = 0.002). Patients with all their VRF treated declined less than those with none of their VRF treated. Those with some VRF treated tended to have an intermediate decline.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients who have Alzheimer disease without CVD, treatment of vascular risk factors (VRF) is associated with a slower decline in Mini-Mental State Examination score. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this association, but our data suggest that dementia should not prevent treatment of VRF.},

In regions that participate in higher cognitive function, middle temporal, posterior cingulate, inferior parietal and precuneus regions, and neuroimaging studies indicate an association involving VRFs, cerebral hypoperfusion, and cognitive decline in elderly individuals who develop AD. The VRF can be present in cognitively intact individuals for decades before mild cognitive deficits or neuropathological signs are manifested. In that sense, they may be "ticking time bombs" before cognitive function is demolished. Preventive intervention of modifiable VRF may delay or block progression of AD.

The present paper summarizes research showing that Western diet intake is associated with cognitive impairment, with a specific emphasis on learning and memory functions that are dependent on the integrity of the hippocampus. The paper then considers evidence that saturated fat and simple carbohydrate intake is correlated with neurobiological changes in the hippocampus that may be related to the ability of these dietary components to impair cognitive function. Finally, a model is described proposing that Western diet consumption contributes to the development of excessive food intake and obesity, in part, by interfering with a type of hippocampal-dependent memory inhibition that is critical in the ability of animals to refrain from responding to environmental cues associated with food, and ultimately from consuming energy intake in excess of that driven solely by caloric need.},

	abstract = {1253
Objectives: The brain’s glymphatic system is implicated in the clearance of toxic waste products such as amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) \& is more active during sleep than wakefulness. PET in conjunction with various radioligands such as [11C]PIB \& [18F]florbetaben (FBB) allows for measurement of Aβ accumulation in the brain, which is used as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. Aβ burden increases with age, which might reflect in part, disrupted clearance by the glymphatic system secondary to age-related reduction in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production \& loss of aquaporin-4 water channels on glial cells. Interestingly it has been reported that Aβ load is higher in elderly healthy controls reporting poor sleep compared to those that report over 7 hours of sleep. Here we compared FBB binding in brain (reflecting Aβ load) in healthy controls after sleep deprivation (SD) \& after rested wakefulness (RW). We hypothesized that FBB binding would be higher after SD than after RW.
Methods: Our study included fifteen healthy participants (9F, 6M, age = 41.5±14.2, range 22-72 years old). Participants stayed overnight in the clinical center before the PET scans for both the RW and SD sessions \& were scanned the following morning at about 12:30 PM. FBB scans were performed using a Siemens high-resolution PET scanner after i.v. injection about 9 mCi \& using list mode acquisition for 120 minutes. FSL \& FreeSurfer were used for segmentation of structural MRI, for alignment of PET \& MRI, \& normalization to MNI space. FBB binding was assessed with the ratio of standard uptake value (SUVr) using cerebellum as reference region. SPM8 was used for statistical analysis of within-subject factor (RW vs. SD).
Results: No significant difference (p = 0.24) in whole brain FBB binding (SUVr) was found between RW (1.25±0.03) \& SD (1.24±0.04). The whole brain FBB binding was highly reproducible between the two sessions (Intraclass correlation coefficient (3, 1) = 0.88, r = 0.89, p {\textless} 0.0001). There was a significant positive correlation of whole brain FBB binding after RW with age (r= 0.67, p=0.007) \& body mass index (BMI, r= 0.61, p=0.016). Voxelwise analysis of FBB binding using SUVr did not yield any significant regional difference between RW and SD.
Conclusion: There was no difference in the distribution of FBB in the whole brain by acute sleep deprivation, which is likely to reflect the predominant binding of FBB to Aβ plaque rather than soluble Aβ. Our study showed significant increases in FBB binding in brain associated with age \& BMI; consistent with increased risk for Aβ accumulation with aging and with obesity. PET radiotracers that target soluble Aβ are needed to evaluate the effects of sleep on Aβ clearance in the human brain. Research Support: Supported by NIH IRP (Y1AA3009) and Piramal Pharma, Inc.},

BM is traditionally used for various ailments, but is best known as a neural tonic and memory enhancer. Numerous animal and in vitro studies have been conducted, with many evidencing potential medicinal properties. Several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have substantiated BM's nootropic utility in humans. There is also evidence for potential attenuation of dementia, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. Current evidence suggests BM acts via the following mechanisms—anti-oxidant neuroprotection (via redox and enzyme induction), acetylcholinesterase inhibition and/or choline acetyltransferase activation, β-amyloid reduction, increased cerebral blood flow, and neurotransmitter modulation (acetylcholine [ACh], 5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT], dopamine [DA]). BM appears to exhibit low toxicity in model organisms and humans; however, long-term studies of toxicity in humans have yet to be conducted.

The first 10 patients who have utilized this program include patients with memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), or subjective cognitive impairment (SCI). Nine of the 10 displayed subjective or objective improvement in cognition beginning within 3-6 months, with the one failure being a patient with very late stage AD. Six of the patients had had to discontinue working or were struggling with their jobs at the time of presentation, and all were able to return to work or continue working with improved performance. Improvements have been sustained, and at this time the longest patient follow-up is two and one-half years from initial treatment, with sustained and marked improvement. These results suggest that a larger, more extensive trial of this therapeutic program is warranted. The results also suggest that, at least early in the course, cognitive decline may be driven in large part by metabolic processes. Furthermore, given the failure of monotherapeutics in AD to date, the results raise the possibility that such a therapeutic system may be useful as a platform on which drugs that would fail as monotherapeutics may succeed as key components of a therapeutic system.},

Recently, the first description of the reversal of cognitive decline in patients with early Alzheimer's disease or its precursors, MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and SCI (subjective cognitive impairment), was published [1]. The therapeutic approach used was programmatic and personalized rather than monotherapeutic and invariant, and was dubbed metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration (MEND). Patients who had had to discontinue work were able to return to work, and those struggling at work were able to improve their performance. The patients, their spouses, and their co-workers all reported clear improvements. Here we report the results from quantitative MRI and neuropsychological testing in ten patients with cognitive decline, nine ApoE4+ (five homozygous and four heterozygous) and one ApoE4-, who were treated with the MEND protocol for 5-24 months. The magnitude of the improvement is unprecedented, providing additional objective evidence that this programmatic approach to cognitive decline is highly effective. These results have far-reaching implications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, MCI, and SCI; for personalized programs that may enhance pharmaceutical efficacy; and for personal identification of ApoE genotype.},

The initial Dietary Goals for Americans (1977) proposed increases in carbohydrate intake and decreases in fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and salt consumption that are carried further in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) Report. Important aspects of these recommendations remain unproven, yet a dietary shift in this direction has already taken place even as overweight/obesity and diabetes have increased. Although appealing to an evidence-based methodology, the DGAC Report demonstrates several critical weaknesses, including use of an incomplete body of relevant science; inaccurately representing, interpreting, or summarizing the literature; and drawing conclusions and/or making recommendations that do not reflect the limitations or controversies in the science. An objective assessment of evidence in the DGAC Report does not suggest a conclusive proscription against low-carbohydrate diets. The DGAC Report does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that increases in whole grain and fiber and decreases in dietary saturated fat, salt, and animal protein will lead to positive health outcomes. Lack of supporting evidence limits the value of the proposed recommendations as guidance for consumers or as the basis for public health policy.

We show that both natural and decaffeinated brands of coffee similarly rapidly trigger autophagy in mice. One to 4 h after coffee consumption, we observed an increase in autophagic flux in all investigated organs (liver, muscle, heart) in vivo, as indicated by the increased lipidation of LC3B and the reduction of the abundance of the autophagic substrate sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1). These changes were accompanied by the inhibition of the enzymatic activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), leading to the reduced phosphorylation of p70S6K, as well as by the global deacetylation of cellular proteins detectable by immunoblot. Immunohistochemical analyses of transgenic mice expressing a GFP–LC3B fusion protein confirmed the coffee-induced relocation of LC3B to autophagosomes, as well as general protein deacetylation. Altogether, these results indicate that coffee triggers 2 phenomena that are also induced by nutrient depletion, namely a reduction of protein acetylation coupled to an increase in autophagy. We speculate that polyphenols contained in coffee promote health by stimulating autophagy.},

	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Extracts from and alkaloids contained in plants in the genus Sceletium have been reported to inhibit ligand binding to serotonin transporter. From this, the conclusion was made that Sceletium products act as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors. However, other mechanisms which may similarly result in the anxiolytic or anti-depressant effect ascribed to Sceletium, such as monoamine release, have not been investigated.
AIMS OF THE STUDY: The current study investigated simultaneously and at two consecutive time points, the effect of high-mesembrine Sceletium extract on both monoamine release and serotonin reuptake into both human astrocytes and mouse hippocampal neurons, as well as potential inhibitory effects on relevant enzyme activities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human astrocytes and mouse hippocampal cells were treated with citalopram or Sceletium extract for 15 and 30min, after which protein expression levels of serotonin transporter (SERT) and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VAMT-2) was assessed using fluorescent immunocytochemistry and digital image analysis. Efficacy of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidate-A (MAO-A) activity were assessed using the Ellman and Olsen methods (and appropriate controls) respectively.
RESULTS: We report the first investigation of mechanism of action of Sceletium extract in the context of serotonin transport, release and reuptake in a cellular model. Cell viability was not affected by Sceletium treatment. High-mesembrine Sceletium extract down-regulated SERT expression similarly to citalopram. In addition, VMAT-2 was upregulated significantly in response to Sceletium treatment. The extract showed only relatively mild inhibition of AChE and MAO-A.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the serotonin reuptake inhibition activity ascribed to the Sceletium plant, is a secondary function to the monoamine-releasing activity of high-mesembrine Sceletium extract (Trimesemine(TM)).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reflux esophagitis is caused mainly by excessive exposure of the mucosa to gastric contents. In the present study, we examined the effect of several amino acids on acid reflux esophagitis in rats.
MATERIAL/METHODS: After 18 h of fasting, acid reflux esophagitis was induced by ligating both the pylorus and the transitional region between the forestomach and the corpus under ether anesthesia, and the animals were killed 4 h later. The severity of esophagitis was reduced by the oral administration of omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, or pepstatin, a specific pepsin inhibitor.
RESULTS: The development of esophageal lesions was dose-dependently prevented by L-arginine and glycine, given intragastrically (i.g.) after the ligation, with complete inhibition obtained at 250 mg/kg and 750 mg/kg, respectively, and these effects were not influenced by the prior s.c. administration of indomethacin or L-NAME. By contrast, both L-alanine and L-glutamine given i.g. after the ligation aggravated these lesions in a dose-dependent manner. These amino acids had no effect on acid secretion but increased the pH of the gastric contents to 1.8{\textasciitilde}2.3 due to their buffering action.
CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed an essential role for acid and pepsin in the pathogenesis of acid reflux esophagitis in the rat model and further suggested that various amino acids affect the severity of esophagitis in different ways, due to yet unidentified mechanisms; L-alanine and L-glutamine exert a deleterious effect on the esophagitis, while L-arginine and glycine are highly protective, independent of endogenous prostaglandins and nitric oxide.},

Parkinsonian animal models reveal exercise-related protection from dopaminergic neurotoxins, apparently mediated by brain neurotrophic factors and neuroplasticity (predicted from in vitro studies). Similarly, exercise consistently improves cognition in animals, also linked to enhanced neuroplasticity and increased neurotrophic factor expression. In these animal models, immobilization has the opposite effect. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may mediate at least some of this exercise benefit. In humans, exercise increases serum BDNF, and this is known to cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier. PD risk in humans is significantly reduced by midlife exercise, documented in large prospective studies. No studies have addressed whether exercise influences dementia risk in PD, but exercised patients with PD improve cognitive scores. Among seniors in general, exercise or physical fitness has not only been associated with better cognitive scores, but midlife exercise significantly reduces the later risk of both dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Finally, numerous studies in seniors with and without dementia have reported increased cerebral gray matter volumes associated with physical fitness or exercise. These findings have several implications for PD clinicians. 1) Ongoing vigorous exercise and physical fitness should be highly encouraged. 2) PD physical therapy programs should include structured, graduated fitness instruction and guidance for deconditioned patients with PD. 3) Levodopa and other forms of dopamine replenishment therapy should be utilized to achieve the maximum capability and motivation for patients to maintain fitness.},

Based on discussions held by a global collaborative initiative on translation of stem cell therapy in Parkinson’s disease, we have identified a set of key questions that we believe should be addressed ahead of every clinical stem cell-based transplantation trial in this disorder. In this article, we first provide a short history of cell therapy in Parkinson’s disease and briefly describe the current state-of-art regarding human stem cell-derived dopamine neurons for use in any patient trial. With this background information as a foundation, we then discuss each of the key questions in relation to the upcoming therapeutic trial and critically assess if the time is ripe for clinical translation of parthenogenetic stem cell technology in Parkinson’s disease.},

Expression of NGF and BDNF mRNA in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus was studied by Northern blot analysis. Taking into account the fact that pharmacological activity of Noopept is realized after both acute and chronic treatment, we studied the effect of single and long-term treatment (28 days) with this drug. Expression of the studied neurotropic factors in the cerebral cortex was below the control after single administration of Noopept, while chronic administration caused a slight increase in BDNF expression. In the hippocampus, expression of mRNA for both neurotrophins increased after acute administration of Noopept. Chronic treatment with Noopept was not followed by the development of tolerance, but even potentiated the neurotrophic effect. These changes probably play a role in neuronal restoration. We showed that the nootropic drug increases expression of neurotrophic factors in the hippocampus. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that neurotrophin synthesis in the hippocampus determines cognitive function, particularly in consolidation and delayed memory retrieval. Published data show that neurotrophic factor deficiency in the hippocampus is observed not only in advanced Alzheimer's disease, but also at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (pre-disease state). In light of this our findings suggest that Noopept holds much promise to prevent the development of Alzheimer's disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, therapeutic effectiveness of Noopept should be evaluated at the initial stage of Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {This in vivo study evaluates the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration on nitric oxide (NO) production by the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). NO production was induced in the rat by the ip administration of 2 mg/100 g lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This treatment caused: (1) a decrease in body temperature within 90 min, followed by a slow return to normal levels; (2) an increase in plasma levels of urea, nitrite/nitrate, and citrulline; (3) the appearance in blood of nitrosyl-hemoglobin (NO-Hb) and in liver of dinitrosyl-iron-dithiolate complexes (DNIC); and (4) increased expression of iNOS mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Rat treatment with 15 mg/100 g NAC ip, 30 min before LPS, resulted in a significant decrease in blood NO-Hb levels, plasma nitrite/nitrate and citrulline concentrations, and liver DNIC complexes. PBMC also showed a decreased expression of iNOS mRNA. NAC pretreatment did not modify the increased levels of plasma urea or the hypothermic effect induced by the endotoxin. The administration of NAC following LPS intoxication (15 min prior to sacrifice) did not affect NO-Hb levels. These results demonstrate that NAC administration can modulate the massive NO production induced by LPS. This can be attributed mostly to the inhibitory effect of NAC on one of the events leading to iNOS protein expression. This hypothesis is also supported by the lack of effect of late NAC administration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Renal failure induced by radiographic contrast agents is a known complication of coronary angiography, especially among patients with chronic renal failure. Recently, treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to have a protective effect but the mechanisms are unknown. We examined the hypothesis that NAC protected against contrast-induced renal impairment through effects on nitric oxide metabolism and oxidative stress.
METHODS: Patients with a serum creatinine concentration above 10(6) micromol/L undergoing coronary angiography were randomly assigned to receive either NAC 1 g (N= 24) or placebo (N= 29) twice daily 24 hours before and after angiography with 0.45\% saline hydration in a double-blind study. Creatinine clearance was calculated and urinary nitric oxide and F2-isoprostane excretion were measured at baseline, 24 and 96 hours after angiography.
RESULTS: Treatment with NAC significantly improved the effect of contrast media on creatinine clearance, and maximal beneficial effect was observed 24 hours after angiography. Creatinine clearance (mL/min) was 59.5 +/- 4.4, 64.7 +/- 5.8, and 58.7 + 3.9 at baseline, 24, and 96 hours after angiography in the NAC group, respectively, and 65.2 +/- 3.2, 51.5 +/- 3.7, and 53.6 +/- 3.9 in the placebo group, respectively (P {\textless} 0.0001). NAC treatment prevented the reduction in urinary nitric oxide after angiography. The urinary nitric oxide/creatinine ratio (micromol/mg) was 0.0058 +/- 0.0004, 0.0057 +/- 0.0004, and 0.0052 +/- 0.0004 at baseline, 24, and 96 hours after angiography in NAC group, respectively, and 0.0057 +/- 0.0007, 0.0031 +/- 0.0005, and 0.0039 +/- 0.0005 in the placebo group, respectively (P= 0.013). NAC had no significant effect on urinary F2-isoprostanes.
CONCLUSION: NAC treatment has renoprotective effect in patients with mild chronic renal failure undergoing coronary angiography that may be mediated in part by an increase in nitric oxide production.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on nitric oxide and adrenergic pathways in mesenteric artery from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY).
METHODS: Rats were treated with 4 g x kg(-1) x day(-1) of NAC during 4 weeks or mesenteric beds were treated with 10 mmol/L of NAC during 20 min.
RESULTS: In conscious rats, the NAC treatment produced a significant reduction of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate in SHR (P {\textless}.001). N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) caused a MAP increase in NAC-treated SHR of magnitude similar to that in WKY, which was significantly higher than that observed in control untreated SHR (P {\textless}.05). Chronic treatments with NAC improved the maximal relaxation of mesenteric arteries to A23187 in SHR (P {\textless}.001). Acute NAC treatment in vitro induced a vasodilation in Phe preconstricted arteries (P {\textless}.001) that was stronger in SHR than in WKY (P {\textless}.05) and was not abolished by L-NAME. The vasoconstrictory response and increases in inositol phosphate production induced by superoxide anion were attenuated by NAC treatment through its superoxide scavenging properties. In contrast, chronic and acute NAC treatments did not alter the vasodilatory response to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in NO-mediated vasodilator tone and the possible decrease in adrenergic vasoconstriction induced by NAC treatment in SHR could explain the hypotensive effect of NAC in this model of hypertension.},

This sensitizing GABAergic input is controlled by dopamine D1 receptors, with horizontal cells serving as a plausible source of GABA release. Our findings expand the role of dopamine in vision from its well-established function of suppressing rod-driven signals in bright light to enhancing the same signals under dim illumination.

To test these proposals we recorded in cat primary visual cortex (V1) following local iontophoresis of gabazine, the selective GABAA antagonist. Gabazine increased responsiveness by as much as 300\%. It slightly decreased selectivity for stimulus orientation and direction, often by raising responses to all orientations. Strikingly, gabazine affected neither contrast sensitivity nor cross-orientation suppression, the competition seen when stimuli of different orientation are superimposed. These results were captured by a simple model where GABAA inhibition has the same selectivity as excitation, and keeps responses to unwanted stimuli below threshold. We conclude that GABAA inhibition in V1 helps enhance stimulus selectivity but is not responsible for competition among superimposed stimuli. It controls the sensitivity of V1 neurons by adjusting their response gain, without affecting their input gain.},

	abstract = {GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in human brain. The level of GABA varies substantially across individuals, and this variability is associated with interindividual differences in visual perception. However, it remains unclear whether the association between GABA level and visual perception reflects a general influence of visual inhibition or whether the GABA levels of different cortical regions selectively influence perception of different visual features. To address this, we studied how the GABA levels of parietal and occipital cortices related to interindividual differences in size, orientation, and brightness perception. We used visual contextual illusion as a perceptual assay since the illusion dissociates perceptual content from stimulus content and the magnitude of the illusion reflects the effect of visual inhibition. Across individuals, we observed selective correlations between the level of GABA and the magnitude of contextual illusion. Specifically, parietal GABA level correlated with size illusion magnitude but not with orientation or brightness illusion magnitude; in contrast, occipital GABA level correlated with orientation illusion magnitude but not with size or brightness illusion magnitude. Our findings reveal a region- and feature-dependent influence of GABA level on human visual perception. Parietal and occipital cortices contain, respectively, topographic maps of size and orientation preference in which neural responses to stimulus sizes and stimulus orientations are modulated by intraregional lateral connections. We propose that these lateral connections may underlie the selective influence of GABA on visual perception., SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in human visual system, varies substantially across individuals. This interindividual variability in GABA level is linked to interindividual differences in many aspects of visual perception. However, the widespread influence of GABA raises the question of whether interindividual variability in GABA reflects an overall variability in visual inhibition and has a general influence on visual perception or whether the GABA levels of different cortical regions have selective influence on perception of different visual features. Here we report a region- and feature-dependent influence of GABA level on human visual perception. Our findings suggest that GABA level of a cortical region selectively influences perception of visual features that are topographically mapped in this region through intraregional lateral connections.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of saturated phosphatidylcholine (Phospholipon® 90H) as extended release excipient in matrix tablets for three model drugs with different aqueous solubility (theophylline, caffeine and diprophylline). The tablets could be prepared by direct compression because of the favorable phospholipid powder flow properties (Carr's index: 12.64 and angle of repose: 28.85) and good compactibility. Tablets of low porosity were formed already at low pressure of 40MPa and with drug loadings up to 70\% due to high plasticity of the phospholipid. Extended drug release was achieved with the drugs of different solubility and at various drug loadings. For example, the caffeine release time (t80\%) from 8mm tablets ranged from 1.5h to 18h at 70\% and 10\% drug loading, respectively. The drug release was governed by diffusion and could therefore be modelled by Fick's law of diffusion. Drug release profiles were thus a function of drug solubility, drug loading and tablet dimension. Matrix tablets of caffeine (20\% drug loading) showed robust dissolution with regard to agitation (50-100rpm) and ionic strength of the release media (100-600 mOsmol/kg). Caffeine release was pH-dependent with a faster drug release at acidic pH, which was attributed to a protonization of the phosphatidyl group of the matrix-former and thus a higher hydrophilicity.},

Daily nicotine (2 mg/kg, sc, four times daily) administration for 14 days and its abrupt withdrawal significantly impaired avoidance learning in inhibitory avoidance task as indicated by a significant decrease in the step through latency. Animals injected with agmatine (10-40 μg/rat, icv) from day 7 to 14 before the first daily dose of nicotine (2 mg/kg, sc) showed increased step through latencies during retrieval test. Similarly Intracerebroventricular injection of l-arginine (25-100 μg/rat), a biosynthetic precursor of agmatine and arcaine (50 μg -100 μg/rat), an agmatinase inhibitor, also increased the step through latency during retrieval test in nicotine withdrawn animals. In separate experiments, α2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (0.5-1 μg/rat, icv) not only demonstrated significant increase in the step through latency as in nicotine withdrawn rats but also potentiated the pharmacological effect of agmatine. In contrast, pre-treatment of α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (0.5 μg/rat, icv) antagonized the memory enhancing effect of agmatine (20 μg/rat, icv) in nicotine withdrawn rats. In addition, brain agmatine analysis carried out at 72 h time point of nicotine withdrawal showed marked decrease in basal brain agmatine content as compared to control. Overall, the data indicate that agmatine attenuates nicotine withdrawal induced memory impairment through modulation of α2adrenergic receptors. Thus, agmatine might have therapeutic implications in the treatment of cognitive deficits following nicotine withdrawal.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D and magnesium (Mg) are some of the most studied topics in medicine with enormous implications for human health and disease. Majority of the adults are deficient in both vitamin D and magnesium but continue to go unrecognized by many health care professionals.
AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: Mg and vitamin D are used by all the organs in the body, and their deficiency states may lead to several chronic medical conditions. Studies described in the literature regarding these disease associations are contradictory, and reversal of any of these conditions may not occur for several years after adequate replacement. One should consider the supplementation therapy to be preventative rather than curative at this time.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed search of several reported associations between vitamin D and Mg with diseases.
RESULTS: Vitamin D and Mg replacement therapy in elderly patients is known to reduce the nonvertebral fractures, overall mortality, and the incidence of Alzheimer dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D screening assay is readily available, but the reported lower limit of the normal range is totally inadequate for disease prevention. Based on the epidemiologic studies, âˆ¼75\% of all adults worldwide have serum 25(OH)D levels of {\textless}30 ng/mL. Because of the recent increase in global awareness, vitamin D supplementation has become a common practice, but Mg deficiency still remains unaddressed. Screening for chronic magnesium deficiency is difficult because a normal serum level may still be associated with moderate to severe deficiency. To date, there is no simple and accurate laboratory test to determine the total body magnesium status in humans. Mg is essential in the metabolism of vitamin D, and taking large doses of vitamin D can induce severe depletion of Mg. Adequate magnesium supplementation should be considered as an important aspect of vitamin D therapy.},

	abstract = {Astaxanthin (AXT) is a carotenoid with multiple health benefits. It is currently marketed as a health supplement and is well known for its antioxidant capacity. Recent evidence has emerged to suggest a broad range of biological activities. The interest in this compound has increased dramatically over the last few years and many studies are now applying this molecule across many disease models. Results from the current research are beginning to come together to suggest neuroprotective properties including anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant effects, as well as the potential to promote or maintain neural plasticity. These emergent mechanisms of actions implicate AXT as a promising therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative disease. This review will examine and extrapolate from the recent literature to build support for the use of AXT in mitigating neuropathy in normal aging and neurodegenerative disease.},

The safety, bioavailability and effects of astaxanthin on oxidative stress and inflammation that have relevance to the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, have been assessed in a small number of clinical studies. No adverse events have been reported and there is evidence of a reduction in biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation with astaxanthin administration. Experimental studies in several species using an ischaemia-reperfusion myocardial model demonstrated that astaxanthin protects the myocardium when administered both orally or intravenously prior to the induction of the ischaemic event. At this stage we do not know whether astaxanthin is of benefit when administered after a cardiovascular event and no clinical cardiovascular studies in humans have been completed and/or reported. Cardiovascular clinical trials are warranted based on the physicochemical and antioxidant properties, the safety profile and preliminary experimental cardiovascular studies of astaxanthin.},

Liver damage often occurs in relation to oxidative stress with metabolic disorders, including cellular lipid accumulation. Astaxanthin (3,3′-dihydroxy-β,β-carotene-4,4′dione), a xanthophyll carotenoid, is a candidate for liver protection. Here, we briefly review astaxanthin as a potential protector against liver damage. In particular, studies have reported antioxidative effects of astaxanthin in liver tissues. Astaxanthin treatment is also reported to improve hyperlipidemia, which indirectly induces the antioxidative effects of astaxanthin on liver pathologies. Furthermore, astaxanthin may alleviate liver damage independent of its antioxidative effects. Of note, there are still insufficient human data to observe the effect of astaxanthin treatment on liver function in clinical conditions. More studies investigating the relevance of astaxanthin on liver protection are necessary.},

	abstract = {Astaxanthin is a carotenoid with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of astaxanthin on skin deterioration, we confirmed its role in epidermal-dermal interactions in vitro. Astaxanthin treatment suppressed ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced inflammatory cytokine secretion in keratinocytes, and matrix metalloproteinase-1 secretion by fibroblasts cultured in UVB-irradiated keratinocyte medium. To verify these findings, we conducted a 16-week clinical study with 65 healthy female participants. Participants were orally administered either a 6 mg or 12 mg dose of astaxanthin or a placebo. Wrinkle parameters and skin moisture content significantly worsened in the placebo group after 16 weeks. However, significant changes did not occur in the astaxanthin groups. Interleukin-1α levels in the stratum corneum significantly increased in the placebo and low-dose groups but not in the high-dose group between weeks 0 and 16. This study was performed in Japan from August to December, when changing environmental factors, such as UV and dryness, exacerbate skin deterioration. In conclusion, our study suggests that long-term prophylactic astaxanthin supplementation may inhibit age-related skin deterioration and maintain skin conditions associated with environmentally induced damage via its anti-inflammatory effect.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin K₂ contributes to bone and cardiovascular health. Therefore, two vitamin K₂ homologues, menaquinone-4 (MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7), have been used as nutrients by the food industry and as nutritional supplements to support bone and cardiovascular health. However, little is known about the bioavailability of nutritional MK-4. To investigate MK-4 and MK-7 bioavailability, nutritional doses were administered to healthy Japanese women.
FINDINGS: Single dose administration of MK-4 (420 μg; 945 nmol) or MK-7 (420 μg; 647 nmol) was given in the morning together with standardized breakfast. MK-7 was well absorbed and reached maximal serum level at 6 h after intake and was detected up to 48 h after intake. MK-4 was not detectable in the serum of all subjects at any time point. Consecutive administration of MK-4 (60 μg; 135 nmol) or MK-7 (60 μg; 92 nmol) for 7 days demonstrated that MK-4 supplementation did not increase serum MK-4 levels. However, consecutive administration of MK-7 increased serum MK-7 levels significantly in all subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that MK-4 present in food does not contribute to the vitamin K status as measured by serum vitamin K levels. MK-7, however significantly increases serum MK-7 levels and therefore may be of particular importance for extrahepatic tissues.},

	abstract = {Vitamin D insufficiency affects almost 50\% of the population worldwide. An estimated 1 billion people worldwide, across all ethnicities and age groups, have a vitamin D deficiency (VDD). This pandemic of hypovitaminosis D can mainly be attributed to lifestyle (for example, reduced outdoor activities) and environmental (for example, air pollution) factors that reduce exposure to sunlight, which is required for ultraviolet-B (UVB)-induced vitamin D production in the skin. High prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency is a particularly important public health issue because hypovitaminosis D is an independent risk factor for total mortality in the general population. Current studies suggest that we may need more vitamin D than presently recommended to prevent chronic disease. As the number of people with VDD continues to increase, the importance of this hormone in overall health and the prevention of chronic diseases are at the forefront of research. VDD is very common in all age groups. As few foods contain vitamin D, guidelines recommended supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable upper limit levels. It is also suggested to measure the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level as the initial diagnostic test in patients at risk for deficiency. Treatment with either vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 is recommended for deficient patients. A meta-analysis published in 2007 showed that vitamin D supplementation was associated with significantly reduced mortality. In this review, we will summarize the mechanisms that are presumed to underlie the relationship between vitamin D and understand its biology and clinical implications.},

However, recent research indicates that free radicals may be related to sleep induction as well as cellular damage, suggesting that a common target of action may mediate modafinil’s ability to oppose both of these effects. In this review we summarize and discuss previously published research on modafinil’s neural, cytoprotective, and cognitive effects, and we propose possible primary biochemical targets that could underlie the effects of modafinil observed in these studies. We also suggest neurocognitive mechanisms responsible for modafinil’s cognitive enhancing effects and its therapeutic potential in the treatment of stimulant addiction.},

	abstract = {Several lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress might contribute to neurotoxicity in the dopaminergic nerve terminals after administration of methamphetamine (MAP). The present study undertakes to determine whether intravenous administration of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant drug, could attenuate the reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum of monkey brain after administration of MAP. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies demonstrated that repeated administration of MAP (2 mg/kg as a salt, four times at 2-h intervals) significantly decreased the accumulation of radioactivity in the striatum after intravenous administration of [11C]b-CFT (for DAT). In contrast, the binding of [11C]DASB to 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter (5-HTT) in the monkey brain was slightly decreased after the administration of MAP, although the difference was not statistically significant. The binding of [11C]SCH 23390 to dopamine D1 receptors in the striatum was also not altered after the administration of MAP. A bolus injection of NAC (150 mg/kg, i.v.) 30 min before administration of MAP and a subsequent continuous infusion of NAC (12 mg/kg/h, i.v.) over 8.5 h significantly attenuated the reduction of DAT in the monkey striatum 3 weeks after the administration of MAP. These results suggest that NAC could attenuate the reduction of DAT in the monkey striatum after repeated administration of MAP. Therefore, it is likely that NAC would be a suitable drug for treatment of neurotoxicity on dopaminergic nerve terminals related to chronic use of MAP in humans.},

	abstract = {Backgound The purpose of this study was to assess the biological and clinical effects of n-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Methods The overarching goal of this pilot study was to generate additional data about potentially protective properties of NAC in PD, using an in vitro and in vivo approach. In preparation for the clinical study we performed a cell tissue culture study with human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons that were treated with rotenone as a model for PD. The primary outcome in the cell tissue cultures was the number of cells that survived the insult with the neurotoxin rotenone. In the clinical study, patients continued their standard of care and were randomized to receive either daily NAC or were a waitlist control. Patients were evaluated before and after 3 months of receiving the NAC with DaTscan to measure dopamine transporter (DAT) binding and the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) to measure clinical symptoms. Results The cell line study showed that NAC exposure resulted in significantly more mDA neurons surviving after exposure to rotenone compared to no NAC, consistent with the protective effects of NAC previously observed. The clinical study showed significantly increased DAT binding in the caudate and putamen (mean increase ranging from 4.4\% to 7.8\%; p{\textless}0.05 for all values) in the PD group treated with NAC, and no measurable changes in the control group. UPDRS scores were also significantly improved in the NAC group (mean improvement of 12.9\%, p = 0.01). Conclusions The results of this preliminary study demonstrate for the first time a potential direct effect of NAC on the dopamine system in PD patients, and this observation may be associated with positive clinical effects. A large-scale clinical trial to test the therapeutic efficacy of NAC in this population and to better elucidate the mechanism of action is warranted.

This alkaloid is believed to be synthesized via condensation of the amino acid derivative, tryptamine and secologanine by the action of strictosidine synthase (STR). The cDNA clone encoding STR from M. speciosa was cloned through reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and denoted as StrMs1. The clone is a full-length cDNA with a size of 1257 bp, which contains an open reading frame of 1056 bp starting from base pair 18 to 1076. Sequence analysis showed that StrMs1 has high homology with other STRs of TIA-producing plants. Nucleotide sequence of StrMs1 was deposited in GenBank with accession number ADK91432. The deduced amino acid sequence has 352 residues with a predicted molecular weight of 39 kDa and isoelectric point at pH 5.78. Southern blot performed showed that there is only one copy of StrMs1 present in the genome of M. speciosa. Expression pattern on different tissues tested using RT-PCR revealed that besides leaf, the expression was also detected in root, stem and flower. Expression profiles under plant defense signal using salicylic acid (SA) was investigated on leaf tissues and the results showed that the transcript of StrMs1 were detected before and after treatment with salicylic acid. Result obtained from phylogenetic analysis suggested that StrMs1 is the most evolved protein among other STRs. However, the 3-D prediction of StrMs1 showed that there are alpha helices and beta propeller structures, which remain conserved withother STRs.Key word: Strictosidine synthase, Mitragyna speciosa, StrMs1, semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), molecular evolution, protein prediction.},

Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli afforded the soluble proteins as an apparent band of 57 kDa as judged by SDS-PAGE. Expression of the MsTDC in M. speciosa hairy roots under the 35S promoter was performed by insertion of MsTDC into pCAMBIA1300-gfp. The transgenic hairy root lines were detected by fluorescence microscopy and showed an increased accumulation of tryptamine.},

For studying the secondary metabolite production, the n-hexane extract of the hairy roots was prepared and the compounds were isolated by silica gel column chromatography, affording triterpenoids (ursolic acid and oleanolic acid) and phytosterols (β-sitosterol and stigmasterol). The shoots from the hairy root cultures were regenerated and differentiated to the plantlets. For micropropagation, shoot multiplication was successfully induced from the axillary buds of the regenerated plantlets in WPM supplemented with 0.1 mg/l thidiazuron.

	abstract = {Mitragyna speciosa is a psychoactive plant known as “ketum” in Malaysia and “kratom” in Thailand. This plant is distinctly known to produce two important alkaloids, namely mitragynine (MG) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH-MG) that can bind to opioid receptors [1]. MG was reported to exhibit antidepressant properties in animal studies [2]. These compounds were also proposed to have the potential to replace opioid analgesics with much lower risks of side effects [3]. To date, there are only over 40 metabolites identified in M. speciosa [4,5]. To obtain a more complete profile of secondary metabolites in ketum, we performed metabolomics study using mature leaves of the green M. speciosa variety. The leaf samples were extracted using methanol prior to liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-TOF-MS) analysis. This data can be useful to for the identification of unknown metabolites that are associated with alkaloid biosynthesis pathway in M. speciosa.},

The results indicated that high contents of secologanin, caffeic acid, gallic acid, epigallocatechin, and mitragynine were accumulated in leaves. In M. speciosa, feedings of tryptamine, tryptophan, phenylalanine or tyrosine significantly increased the mitragynine contents. Feedings of tryptamine and loganin also enhanced the mitragynine accumulation, but feeding of loganin only did not affect the mitragynine level. The mRNA levels of anthranilate synthase alpha subunit (ASA), tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC), and strictosidine synthase (STR) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in control plants and those exposed to methyl jasmonate (MJ; 10 microM). All genes responded to MJ after a 24-h treatment. The mitragynine contents were also enhanced and corresponded to the transcript levels. From the present results we conclude that a high content of secologanin together with a undetectable level of tryptamine in M. speciosa feature the limitation of mitragynine biosynthesis. Additionally, expression of all the genes limits production of an essential precursor for mitragynine production.},

	abstract = {Background
Supplementation with a phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylserine/ phosphatidic acid complex (PAS) has been observed to normalize stress induced dysregulations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA). Prolonged stress first induces a hyper-activation of the HPAA, which then can be followed by a state of hypo-activation., The aim of this study was to examine effects of an oral supplementation with 400 mg PS \& 400 mg PA (PAS 400) per day on the endocrine stress response (ACTH, saliva and serum cortisol) to a psychosocial stressor. A special focus was to analyze subgroups of low versus high chronically stressed subjects as well as to test efficacy of 200 mg PS \& 200 mg PA (PAS 200).

Methods
75 healthy male volunteers were enrolled for this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, stratified by chronic stress level, and randomly allocated to one of three study arms (placebo, PAS 200 and PAS 400 per day, respectively). Study supplementation was administered for 42 days for each participant. Chronic stress was measured with the Trier Inventory for Chronic Stress (TICS), and subgroups of high and low chronic stress were differentiated by median values as provided by the TICS authors. A six week period of supplementation was followed by an acute stress test (Trier Social Stress Test - TSST).

Results
Chronic stress levels and other baseline measures did not differ between treatment groups (all p {\textgreater} 0.05). Acute stress was successfully induced by the TSST and resulted in a hyper-responsivity of the HPAA in chronically stressed subjects. Compared to placebo, a supplementation with a daily dose of PAS 400 was effective in normalizing the ACTH (p = 0.010), salivary (p = 0.043) and serum cortisol responses (p = 0.035) to the TSST in chronically high but not in low stressed subjects (all p {\textgreater} 0.05). Compared to placebo, supplementation with PAS 200 did not result in any significant differences in these variables (all p {\textgreater} 0.05). There were no significant effects of supplementation with PAS on heart rate, pulse transit time, or psychological stress response (all p {\textgreater} 0.05).

Conclusion
In chronically stressed subjects, a supplementation with PAS 400 (MemreePlus™) can normalize the hyper-responsivity of the HPAA to an acute stressor.

	abstract = {Multisynaptic neural and endocrine pathways from the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus have been hypothesized to communicate circadian and photic information to the adrenal glands. In humans, light exposure has been reported to have no effect, increase, or decrease cortisol levels. These inconsistent findings in humans may be related to differences among studies including the intensity (∼500 to 5500 lux), duration (15 min to 4 h), and circadian phase of light exposure. The authors assessed the influence of exposure to bright light on cortisol levels in humans during the rising and descending phases of the circadian rhythm of cortisol, that is, when cortisol levels are high. Twenty healthy men and women were studied using a within-subject research design. Subjects were studied in an environment free of time cues for 9 to 10 days. Subjects received a 6.7-h exposure of bright light (∼10,000 lux; equivalent to ambient light intensity just after sunrise or just before sunset) or dim light (∼3 lux; equivalent to candlelight) during the biological night and morning. Bright light exposure significantly reduced plasma cortisol levels at both circadian phases studied, whereas dim light exposure had little effect on cortisol levels. The finding of an acute suppressive effect of bright light exposure on cortisol levels supports the existence of a mechanism by which photic information can acutely influence the human adrenal glands.},

However, not much is known about the interaction between light and temperature exposure and the relationship between morning light induced alertness and its effect on body temperature.

In a randomized crossover study, two white light conditions (4000K, either bright 1200lx or dim 5lx) under three different room temperatures (26, 29 and 32Â°C) were investigated. A lower room temperature increased the core body temperature (CBT) and lowered skin temperature and the distal-proximal temperature gradient (DPG). Moreover, a lower room temperature reduced the subjective sleepiness and reaction time on an auditory psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), irrespective of the light condition. Interestingly, the morning bright light exposure did affect thermophysiological parameters, i.e. it decreased plasma cortisol, CBT and proximal skin temperature and increased the DPG, irrespective of the room temperature. During the bright light session, subjective sleepiness decreased irrespective of the room temperature. However, the change in sleepiness due to the light exposure was not related to these physiological changes.},

Review of refereed journals and scientific literature available in electronic databases and traditional literature available in India was extensively performed. The work reviews correlation of the evidence with traditional claims, elucidation, and evaluation of a plausible concept governing the usage of plants as aphrodisiac in total. Phytoconstituents with known structures have been classified in appropriate chemical groups and the active crude extracts have been tabulated. Data on their pharmacological activity, mechanism of action, and toxicity are reported. The present review provides an overview of the herbs and their active molecule with claims for improvement of sexual behaviour. A number of herbal drugs have been validated for their effect on sexual behavior and fertility and can therefore serve as basis for the identification of new chemical leads useful in sexual and erectile dysfunction.},

	abstract = {Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has well-described rapid antidepressant effects in clinical studies of individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). Preclinical studies investigating the effects of ketamine on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and on sleep slow wave activity (SWA) support its use as a prototype for investigating the neuroplastic mechanisms presumably involved in the mechanism of rapidly acting antidepressants. This review discusses human EEG slow wave sleep parameters and plasma BDNF as central and peripheral surrogate markers of plasticity, and their use in assessing ketamineâ€™s effects. Acutely, ketamine elevates BDNF levels, as well as early night SWA and high-amplitude slow waves; each of these measures correlates with change in mood in depressed patients who respond to ketamine. The slow wave effects are limited to the first night post-infusion, suggesting that their increase is part of an early cascade of events triggering improved mood. Increased total sleep and decreased waking occur during the first and second night post infusion, suggesting that these measures are associated with the enduring treatment response observed with ketamine.},

	abstract = {Impaired fear extinction contributes to the persistence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can be utilized for the study of novel therapeutic agents. Glutamate plays an important role in the formation of traumatic memories, and in the pathophysiology and treatment of PTSD, highlighting several possible drug targets. Recent clinical studies demonstrate that infusion of ketamine, a glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist, rapidly and significantly reduces symptom severity in PTSD patients. In the present study, we examine the mechanisms underlying the actions of ketamine in a rodent model of fear conditioning, extinction, and renewal. Rats received ketamine or saline 24h after fear conditioning and were then subjected to extinction-training on each of the following three days. Ketamine administration enhanced extinction on the second day of training (i.e., reduced freezing behavior to cue) and produced a long-lasting reduction in freezing on exposure to cue plus context 8days later. Additionally, ketamine and extinction exposure increased levels of mTORC1 in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region involved in the acquisition and retrieval of extinction, and infusion of the selective mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin into the mPFC blocked the effects of ketamine on extinction. Ketamine plus extinction also increased cFos in the mPFC and administration of a glutamate-AMPA receptor antagonist blocked the effects of ketamine. These results support the hypothesis that ketamine produces long-lasting mTORC1/protein synthesis and activity dependent effects on neuronal circuits that enhance the expression of extinction and could represent a novel approach for the treatment of PTSD.},

	volume = {59},
	issn = {1881-7742},
	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that medium-chain triacylglycerol (MCT) improved serum albumin concentration in elderly people with protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) and in malnourished rats. However, the mechanism for this effect has not been clarified. Dietary MCT promotes insulin secretion from the pancreas, and insulin activates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) via the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effecter, Akt. mTORC1 promotes mRNA translation through S6K and 4E-BP1. Therefore, we hypothesized that dietary MCT elevates albumin synthesis through promotion of insulin-Akt-mTOR transduction in the liver. To test this hypothesis, we measured phosphorylated Akt, mTOR and albumin in the livers of malnourished rats. In the present study we examined rats fed low-protein diets containing either MCT or long-chain triacylglycerol (LCT) with energy restriction. The plasma and liver albumin levels were significantly higher in the MCT-fed group than in the LCT-fed group. In addition, plasma insulin concentration, liver phosphorylated Akt/Akt and phosphorylated mTOR/mTOR levels were significantly higher in the MCT-fed group than in the LCT-fed group. These results suggest that one of the mechanisms for the albumin improvement effect of dietary MCT is the promotion of albumin synthesis through the insulin-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway of the liver.},

METHOD: The authors investigated cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding in eight adults with Asperger's syndrome and in 10 healthy comparison subjects with single photon emission computed tomography and the selective 5-HT2A receptor ligand 123I iodinated 4-amino-N-[1-[3-(4-fluorophenoxy)propyl]-4-methyl-4-piperidinyl]-5-iodo-2-methoxybenzamide (123I-5-I-R91150).
RESULTS: People with Asperger's syndrome had a significant reduction in cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding in the total, anterior, and posterior cingulate; bilaterally in the frontal and superior temporal lobes; and in the left parietal lobe. Also, reduced receptor binding was significantly related to abnormal social communication.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings suggest that adults with Asperger's syndrome have abnormalities in cortical 5-HT2A receptor density and that this deficit may underlie some clinical symptoms.},

With emphasis on L-tryptophan’s role in synthesis of brain serotonin, details are provided on the research uses of L-tryptophan, particularly L-tryptophan depletion, and on clinical trials that have been conducted using L-tryptophan supplementation. The ability to change the rates of serotonin synthesis in the brain by manipulating concentrations of serum tryptophan is the foundation of much research. As the sole precursor of serotonin, experimental research has shown that L-tryptophan’s role in brain serotonin synthesis is an important factor involved in mood, behavior, and cognition. Furthermore, clinical trials have provided some initial evidence of L-tryptophan’s efficacy for treatment of psychiatric disorders, particularly when used in combination with other therapeutic agents.},

	abstract = {Effects of daily melatonin intake on the circadian rhythms of sleep and wakefulness, rectal temperature and plasma cortisol were examined in a sighted man who had suffered from the non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome. The subject lacked the nocturnal melatonin rise in plasma, but showed robust circadian rhythms in rectal temperature and plasma cortisol. The sleep-wake rhythm free-ran with a period longer than 24 hours. Daily melatonin intake at 21:00 h concentrated sleep episodes in the nocturnal period (24:00-8:00 h), and increased the length of the episodes. A single oral dose (3 mg) of melatonin increased plasma melatonin levels to about 1300 pg/mL within one hour and remained at pharmacological levels for approximately 6 hours. The trough of rectal temperature and the circadian rise of plasma cortisol were fixed to the early morning. A higher dose of melatonin (6 mg) did not improve the general feature. After the cessation of melatonin intake, the sleep-wake rhythm began to free-run together with the circadian rhythms in rectal temperature and plasma cortisol. It is concluded that daily intake of melatonin at early night time resets the circadian rhythms in a sighted man who lacked the nocturnal melatonin rise and showed free-running circadian rhythms in routine life.},

	url = {https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/handle/1805/7875},
	abstract = {Sitting time (ST) is associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors, whereas breaking ST has been reported to be beneficial for reducing cardiovascular risk.

Purpose: The objective of this study is to examine the effects of breaking ST on superficial femoral artery (SFA) endothelial function.

Hypotheses: 1) Prolonged sitting would induce endothelial dysfunction and changes in shear forces, and 2) breaking ST with brief periods of activity would prevent attenuation in endothelial function.

Methods: Twelve nonobese men (24.2 ± 4.2 yr) participated in two randomized 3-h sitting trials. In the sitting (SIT) trial, subjects were seated on a firmly cushioned chair for 3 h without moving their lower extremities. In the breaking ST trial (ACT), subjects sat similar to the SIT trial but walked on a treadmill for 5 min at 2 mph at 30 min, 1 h 30 min, and 2 h 30 min during the sitting interval. SFA flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was assessed at baseline, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h in each trial. Statistical analyses were performed using dependent variables SFA FMD and shear rates. Significance was set at P ≤ 0.05.

Results: In the SIT trial, there was a significant decline in SFA FMD from baseline to 3 h (baseline, 4.72\% ± 3.78\%; 1 h, 0.52\% ± 0.85\%; 2 h, 1.66\% ± 1.11\%; 3 h, 2.2\% ± 2.15; P {\textless} 0.05 by ANOVA) accompanied by a decline in mean shear rate and antegrade shear rate but no difference in shear rate (area under the curve). By two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, ACT prevented the sitting-induced decline in FMD (baseline, 4.5\% ± 2.3\%; 1 h, 5.04\% ± 2.85\%; 2 h, 5.28\% ± 5.05\%; 3 h, 6.9\% ± 4.5\%) along with no decline in shear rates.

Conclusion: Three hours of sitting resulted in a significant impairment in shear rate and SFA FMD. When light activity breaks were introduced hourly during sitting, the decline in FMD was prevented.},

The study was performed as a double-blind six month comparison between active drug and placebo in two parallel groups, with statistical evaluation after four and six months. The patients were chosen from nine centres. One hundred and sixteen out-patients were included and ninety one of them completed the six month study. The acetylcysteine-treated group had a significantly reduced number of sick-leave days caused by exacerbations of chronic bronchitis after the four winter months December-March compared with the control group (NAC 173, placebo 456). The number of exacerbation days was also very much reduced, however, not significantly (NAC 204, placebo 399). At the end of the six month trial, including also two spring months, the absolute numbers of sick-leave days and exacerbation days were still fewer in the acetylcysteine-treated group, (NAC 260, placebo 739) and (NAC 378, placebo 557) respectively. This study demonstrates a significant reduction in sick-leave days after four months of NAC-treatment. A constant tendency to reduction in the number of exacerbations and exacerbation days was also registered after four and six months. The differences in these parameters were, however, not statistically significant. This was probably due to the small number of patients participating.},

	abstract = {Purpose: We investigated the cross-sectional associations between macular pigment optical density (MPOD), plasma lutein (L), and zeaxanthin (Z) concentrations and cognitive function in 184 older adults of the 3-City-Bordeaux cohort.
Methods: MPOD was measured using the two-wavelength autofluorescence method with a modified scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Plasma L and Z (L+Z) concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and were considered either crude or expressed as a ratio of the concentration of plasma lipids (total cholesterol [TC] + triglycerides [TG]). Cognitive performances were assessed using the following four separate neuropsychological tests: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Isaacs Set Test (IST), the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT), and the sum of the three free recalls of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT). These test results were summarized by a composite global cognitive z-score.
Results: Higher MPOD at 0.5° was significantly associated with a higher composite z-score (β = 0.15, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.26), higher BVRT (β = 0.39, 95\%CI 0.08-0.70), and higher IST (β = 1.16, 95\%CI 0.11-2.22) performances. Higher plasma L+Z concentrations were significantly associated with higher IST scores (β = 0.97, 95\%CI 0.01-1.94). Furthermore, a higher L+Z/TC+TG ratio was associated with a higher composite z-score (β = 0.12, 95\%CI 0.01-0.23), along with higher IST (β = 1.02, 95\%CI 0.002-2.04) and FCSRT (β = 1.55, 95\%CI 0.41-2.69) performances.
Conclusions: This analysis suggested that both higher MPOD and L+Z concentrations were significantly associated with higher cognitive performances. However, MPOD measurements have the advantage of being a fast and representative measure of long-term carotenoid intake.},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of supplemental L, Z, and MZ on memory, executive function, and verbal fluency among healthy individuals with low MP levels.
METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, subjects (n = 91; mean±SD age = 45.42±12.40; \% male = 51.6) consumed a daily formulation of 10 mg L, 10 mg MZ, and 2 mg Z (n = 45) or placebo (n = 46) for 12 months. Cognitive domains assessed included verbal and visual learning, immediate and delayed memory, executive function, and verbal fluency. MP and serum carotenoid concentrations of L, Z, and MZ were also measured.
RESULTS: Following 12-month supplementation, individuals in the active group exhibited statistically significant improvements in memory when compared to the placebo group (paired associated learning [PAL] memory score [rANOVA, p = 0.009]; PAL errors [rANOVA, p = 0.017]). Furthermore, the observed reduction in the number of errors made in the PAL task among those in the intervention group was positively and significantly related to observed increases in MP volume (p = 0.005) and observed increases in serum concentrations of L (p = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrates a memory-enhancing effect of daily supplementation with L, Z, and MZ in healthy subjects with low MP at baseline. The implications of these findings for intellectual performance throughout life, and for risk of cognitive decline in later life, warrant further study.},

The density of this biomarker (macular pigment optical density; MPOD) has been positively correlated with cognitive functioning via measures of global cognition, processing speed, and visual-spatial abilities, among others. Although improvements in cognitive function have been found in adults, much less is known about how L and Z intake may support or improve cognitive functioning during periods of rapid developmental change, such as childhood and pre-adolescence. This study examined the relationship between MPOD and cognitive functioning in 51 7-13-year-old children (51\% female). MPOD was measured using heterochromatic flicker photometry (HFP) optimized for this age group. Cognitive function was assessed using the Woodcock-Johnson III (composite standard scores were obtained for Brief Intellectual Ability, Verbal Ability, Cognitive Efficiency, Processing Speed, and Executive Processes). In this sample, MPOD was significantly related to Executive Processes, r(47) = 0.288, p {\textless} 0.05, and Brief Intellectual Ability, r(47) = 0.268, p {\textless} 0.05. The relationship to Cognitive Efficiency was positive and trending but not significant, r(49) = 0.206, p = 0.074. In general, these data are consistent with those of adults showing a link between higher carotenoid status and improved cognitive functioning.},

	abstract = {Objective: Lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) are phytonutrients that accumulate in human brain tissue and positively impact cognition. Given their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and their role in stabilizing cell membranes, L\&Z may relate to measures of white matter integrity (WMI).
Method: The current study tested the relation of retinal (macular pigment optical density/MPOD) and blood serum concentrations of L\&Z to WMI in community-dwelling older adults (n = 54) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Younger adults (n = 38) were recruited as a control group to confirm age-related changes in WMI. A priori analyses focused on four regions of interest (ROIs-genu of the corpus callosum, cingulum, fornix, and uncinate fasciculus). Exploratory whole-brain analyses were also conducted.
Results: Consistent with previous literature, age group (young vs. old) negatively predicted WMI globally, in the genu, cingulum, and fornix (p {\textless} .001). ROI analysis in the older adult sample showed relations of MPOD and serum L\&Z to better WMI in the uncinate fasciculus and cingulum (p {\textless} .05, FWE-corrected). Whole-brain analysis suggested associations between L\&Z and WMI in both anterior white matter tracts vulnerable to age-related decline and posterior tracts (p {\textless} .01, uncorrected).
Conclusions: The current study is among the first to use neuroimaging to measure the relation of L\&Z to brain structure in vivo. Results confirm previous findings that L\&Z influence white matter integrity, particularly in regions vulnerable to age-related decline. The current study contributes to a growing literature investigating the relationship between diet and neural integrity by identifying white matter tracts that may be associated with modifiable dietary factors in older adults.},

Very few studies have addressed the issue of xanthophylls and cognitive function in younger adults, and no controlled trials have been conducted to date to determine whether or not supplementation with L + Z can change cognitive function in this population. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not supplementation with L + Z could improve cognitive function in young (age 18-30), healthy adults. Design: A randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial design was used. Fifty-one young, healthy subjects were recruited as part of a larger study on xanthophylls and cognitive function. Subjects were randomized into active supplement (n = 37) and placebo groups (n = 14). MPOD was measured psychophysically using customized heterochromatic flicker photometry. Cognitive function was measured using the CNS Vital Signs testing platform. MPOD and cognitive function were measured every four months for a full year of supplementation. Results: Supplementation increased MPOD significantly over the course of the year, vs. placebo (p {\textless} 0.001). Daily supplementation with L + Z and increases in MPOD resulted in significant improvements in spatial memory (p {\textless} 0.04), reasoning ability (p {\textless} 0.05) and complex attention (p {\textless} 0.04), above and beyond improvements due to practice effects. Conclusions: Supplementation with L + Z improves CNS xanthophyll levels and cognitive function in young, healthy adults. Magnitudes of effects are similar to previous work reporting correlations between MPOD and cognition in other populations.},

However, equivocal results from smaller studies and clinical trials highlight the need for large population-based studies with comprehensive measures of cognitive function and adjustment for multiple confounders to examine such associations in more depth.
Methods: In the current study, we investigated the association between plasma lutein and zeaxanthin and domain-specific cognitive performance in 4,076 community-dwelling adults aged 50 years or older from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing. Mixed-effects models were fitted with adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic factors, health conditions, and health behaviors.
Results: Higher plasma lutein and zeaxanthin were independently associated with better composite scores across the domains of global cognition, memory, and executive function. We also found evidence that higher plasma zeaxanthin, but not lutein, was associated with better processing speed. These associations were consistent across domains.
Conclusions: Further investigation of the prognostic value of carotenoid concentrations, and their changes, on cognition in similar population-based samples longitudinally is warranted.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: It is well known that the carotenoids lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) improve eye health and an accumulating evidence base suggests cognitive benefits as well. The present study investigated underlying neural mechanisms using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It was hypothesized that lower L and Z concentrations would be associated with neurobiological inefficiency (i.e., increased activation) during cognitive performance.
METHODS: Forty-three community-dwelling older adults (mean age=72 years; 58\% female; 100\% Caucasian) were asked to learn and recall pairs of unrelated words in an fMRI-adapted paradigm. L and Z levels were measured in retina (macular pigment optical density) and serum using validated procedures.
RESULTS: Following first-level contrasts of encoding and retrieval trials minus control trials (p{\textless}.05, family-wise error corrected, minimum voxel cluster=8), L and Z were found to significantly and negatively relate to blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal in central and parietal operculum cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, planum polare, frontal and middle temporal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, postcentral gyrus, precentral gyrus, occipital cortex bilaterally, and cerebellar regions.
CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, the present study represents the first attempt to investigate neural mechanisms underlying the relation of L and Z to cognition using fMRI. The observed results suggest that L and Z promote cognitive functioning in old age by enhancing neural efficiency. (JINS, 2017, 23, 11-22).},

In male wistar rats, escalating doses of MA (1-10mg/kg, i.p.) were administrated twice a day for 10 consecutive days. IN insulin treatment (0.5IU/day, for 7days after MA discontinuation) attenuated MA-induced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze task, and significantly decreased the levels of glial cell markers (GFAP and Iba1), pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) as well as COX2 and NF-κB players of neuroinflammation, in the hippocampus of MA-treated animals.

Oxiracetam, tested at doses of 50, 100, and 300 mg/kg ip, elicted a 63\% increase in ACh release from the hippocampus at the dose of 100 mg/kg only. This effect of oxiracetam was inhibited by perfusion with tetrodotoxin (TTX), 5 × 10−7 M. In oxiracetam-treated rats the decrease in choline efflux was less pronounced than in controls (-23\% of the initial value) at the dose of 100 mg/kg. Aniracetam (100 mg/kg, orally) elicited a sustained increase of ACh release from the hippocampus (+ 58\%, 120 min after the administration), without affecting choline efflux. Doses of 50 and 300 mg/kg, orally, of aniracetam were ineffective. Oxiracetam and aniracetam (50 and 100 mg/kg) neither modified the output of ACh or choline from the parietal cortex nor induced gross behavioral changes.

MPH alone (up to 1 mM) affected neither the growth of HEK-hDAT cells nor the survival of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in primary cultures after treatment up to 72 h. No differences in neuronal arborisation or in the density of synapses were detected. 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) showed no toxic effect in HEK-293 cells, but had significant toxic effects in HEK-hDAT cells and DA neurons. MPH (1 microM - 1 mM) dose-dependently reduced this cytotoxicity in HEK-hDAT cells and primary mesencephalic DA neurons. The presented results show that application of MPH alone does not have any toxic effect on DA cells in vitro. The neurotoxic effects of MPP(+) could be significantly reduced by co-application of MPH, an effect that is most likely explained by MPH blocking the DAT.},

However, this small nine amino acid peptide is involved in a wide variety of physiological and pathological functions such as sexual activity, penile erection, ejaculation, pregnancy, uterus contraction, milk ejection, maternal behavior, osteoporosis, diabetes, cancer, social bonding, and stress, which makes oxytocin and its receptor potential candidates as targets for drug therapy. In this review, we address the issues of drug design and specificity and focus our discussion on recent findings on oxytocin and its heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor OTR. In this regard, we will highlight the following topics: (i) the role of oxytocin in behavior and affectivity, (ii) the relationship between oxytocin and stress with emphasis on the hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal axis, (iii) the involvement of oxytocin in pain regulation and nociception, (iv) the specific action mechanisms of oxytocin on intracellular Ca2+ in the hypothalamo neurohypophysial system (HNS) cell bodies, (v) newly generated transgenic rats tagged by a visible fluorescent protein to study the physiology of vasopressin and oxytocin, and (vi) the action of the neurohypophysial hormone outside the central nervous system, including the myometrium, heart and peripheral nervous system. As a short nine amino acid peptide, closely related to its partner peptide vasopressin, oxytocin appears to be ideal for the design of agonists and antagonists of its receptor. In addition, not only the hormone itself and its binding to OTR, but also its synthesis, storage and release can be endogenously and exogenously regulated to counteract pathophysiological states. Understanding the fundamental physiopharmacology of the effects of oxytocin is an important and necessary approach for developing a potential pharmacotherapy.},

One of them is based on the observation of free radical formation and oxidative stress produced by auto-oxidation of dopamine (DA). The formation of DA-related reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals appears to play an important role in amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Melatonin, the main secretory product of pineal gland, is well known for its protective effects that are currently attributed mainly to its radical scavenging and antioxidant properties. The present study was conducted to investigate the protective effects of melatonin on d-amphetamine (AMPH)-induced neurotoxicity in cultured human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. Our data indicate that AMPH significantly reduces cell viability, induces oxidative stress (enhances ROS production and malondialdehyde levels), up-regulates α-synuclein expression and decreases intracellular ATP levels. However, pretreatment of SK-N-SH cells with melatonin prevents AMPH-induced loss of cell viability and induction of oxidative stress, while reducing α-synuclein expression and increasing ATP production. These results suggest that the antioxidant properties of melatonin may provide a protective mechanism against AMPH-induced neuronal degeneration.},

Amphetamine significantly decreased calpastatin levels but increased calpain levels. An induction in calpain activity was demonstrated by an increase in the formation of calpain spectrin breakdown products. The deleterious effects of amphetamine exposure were diminished in rats by pretreatment with melatonin. In addition, the effect of melatonin on calpastatin expression was investigated in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.

Melatonin, the main secretory product of pineal gland, is well known for its protective effects that are currently attributed mainly to its radical scavenging and antioxidant properties. The present study was conducted to investigate the protective effects of melatonin on d-amphetamine (AMPH)-induced neurotoxicity in cultured human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. Our data indicate that AMPH significantly reduces cell viability, induces oxidative stress (enhances ROS production and malondialdehyde levels), up-regulates α-synuclein expression and decreases intracellular ATP levels. However, pretreatment of SK-N-SH cells with melatonin prevents AMPH-induced loss of cell viability and induction of oxidative stress, while reducing α-synuclein expression and increasing ATP production. These results suggest that the antioxidant properties of melatonin may provide a protective mechanism against AMPH-induced neuronal degeneration.},

The present paper reviews the active, natural principles, and crude extracts of plants, which have been useful in sexual disorders, have potential for improving sexual behaviour and performance, and are helpful in spermatogenesis and reproduction. Review of refereed journals and scientific literature available in electronic databases and traditional literature available in India was extensively performed. The work reviews correlation of the evidence with traditional claims, elucidation, and evaluation of a plausible concept governing the usage of plants as aphrodisiac in total. Phytoconstituents with known structures have been classified in appropriate chemical groups and the active crude extracts have been tabulated. Data on their pharmacological activity, mechanism of action, and toxicity are reported. The present review provides an overview of the herbs and their active molecule with claims for improvement of sexual behaviour. A number of herbal drugs have been validated for their effect on sexual behavior and fertility and can therefore serve as basis for the identification of new chemical leads useful in sexual and erectile dysfunction.},

Opioid consumption has been widely increasing across the globe; how-
ever, it can cause adverse effects on the body. Morphine, an opioid, can reduce sex hor-
mones and fertility. Withania somnifera (WS) is a traditional herb used to improve sexual
activities. This study strives to investigate the effect of WS on sex hormones and gonado-
tropins in addicted male rats.

Materials and Methods
In this experimental study, forty-eight male National Maritime
Research Institute (NMRI) rats were randomly divided into four groups: i. Control group,
ii. WS-treated control group, iii. Addicted group, and iv. WS-treated addicted group. Wa-
ter-soluble morphine was given to rats for 21 days to induce addiction, concurrently the
treated groups (2 and 4) also received WS plant-mixed pelleted food (6.25\%). At the end
of the treatment, the sex hormone and gonadotropin levels of the ratsâ€™ sera were deter-
mined in all the groups.

Results
Except for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), morphine reduced most of the
gonadotropin and sex hormone levels. Whereas WS caused a considerable increase in
the hormones in the treated addicted group, there was only a slight increase in the treated
control group.

Conclusion
WS increased sex hormones and gonadotropins-especially testosterone, es-
trogen, and luteinizing hormone-in the addicted male rats and even increased the proges-
terone level, a stimulant of most sex hormones in addicted male rats.},

	abstract = {Music has existed in human societies since prehistory, perhaps because it allows expression and regulation of emotion and evokes pleasure. In this review, we present findings from cognitive neuroscience that bear on the question of how we get from perception of sound patterns to pleasurable responses. First, we identify some of the auditory cortical circuits that are responsible for encoding and storing tonal patterns and discuss evidence that cortical loops between auditory and frontal cortices are important for maintaining musical information in working memory and for the recognition of structural regularities in musical patterns, which then lead to expectancies. Second, we review evidence concerning the mesolimbic striatal system and its involvement in reward, motivation, and pleasure in other domains. Recent data indicate that this dopaminergic system mediates pleasure associated with music; specifically, reward value for music can be coded by activity levels in the nucleus accumbens, whose functional connectivity with auditory and frontal areas increases as a function of increasing musical reward. We propose that pleasure in music arises from interactions between cortical loops that enable predictions and expectancies to emerge from sound patterns and subcortical systems responsible for reward and valuation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The present study determined if, akin to cocaine, nicotine self-administration in rats induces adaptations in the expression of glutamate transporters and cystine-glutamate exchangers in brain nuclei implicated in reinforcement and if treating cigarette smokers with a drug that restores cystine-glutamate exchange affects the number of cigarettes smoked.
METHODS: Rats self-administered nicotine intravenously for 12 hours/day or received nicotine through osmotic minipumps for 21 days. Somatic signs of withdrawal were measured and immunoblotting was performed 12 hours after the last nicotine exposure to determine if the catalytic subunit of the cystine-glutamate exchanger, xCT, or the glial glutamate transporter, GLT-1, were altered in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, or amygdala. For the smoking reduction study in humans, nicotine-dependent smokers were treated for 4 weeks with N-acetylcysteine (2400 mg daily) to promote cystine-glutamate exchange or placebo. Participants provided weekly ratings of withdrawal symptoms, craving, and carbon monoxide (CO) measurements and logged daily cigarette and alcohol use.
RESULTS: Rats receiving nicotine via self-administration or minipumps displayed somatic signs of withdrawal, but only nicotine self-administering rats showed decreased xCT expression in the nucleus accumbens and VTA and decreased GLT-1 expression in the nucleus accumbens. Human smokers treated with N-acetylcysteine reported a reduction in cigarettes smoked, and there was no effect of N-acetylcysteine on estimates of CO levels, craving, or withdrawal.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the cystine-glutamate exchanger and the glial glutamate transporter are downregulated after nicotine self-administration, and augmenting exchanger activity with N-acetylcysteine reduced the number of cigarettes smoked in nicotine-dependent individuals.},

In contrast, acute exercise may induce acute panic attacks or increase subjective anxiety in patients with panic disorder more than in other people. The effects of quiet rest or an aerobic treadmill exercise (30 min at an intensity of 70\% of the maximal oxygen uptake, VO2max) on cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) induced panic attacks were studied in a crossover design in 12 patients with panic disorder and 12 matched healthy subjects. The effects of CCK-4 (25 microg in patients and 50 microg in control subjects) were measured with the Acute Panic Inventory (API) score, comparing panic attack frequencies, total score, and subscores for anxiety and somatic symptoms. CCK-4-induced panic attacks were less frequent after prior exercise: they occurred in 15 (62.5\%) subjects after rest (9 patients and 6 control subjects), but only 5 (20.8\%) subjects after exercise (4 patients and 1 control subject). In both conditions, CCK-4 administration induced a significant increase in the total API score and the anxiety and somatic symptoms subsores. However, compared to prior rest, exercise resulted in a significantly reduced CCK-4-induced increase of the total API score and the anxiety subscore. In patients with panic disorder exercise increased the total API score and the somatic symptoms subscale but not the anxiety subscore. Patients with panic disorder showed increased somatic but not anxiety symptoms after an acute bout of exercise. Severity of CCK-4-induced panic and anxiety, on the other hand was reduced by exercise. These findings suggest that in addition to exercise training an acute bout of exercise may be used to reduce anxiety and panic attack frequency and intensity in panic disorder patients.},

METHODS: Thirty-five adults (18-65 years of age: 47.09±9.89) meeting criteria for a major depressive episode as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV-Treatment Revised were included in this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study. Subjects were not stratified based on baseline cognitive deficit. Subjects were randomized to 4 weeks of either intranasal insulin 40 International Units (IU) taken four times a day (i.e., morning, afternoon, evening, and before bed) (QID) (n=19) or placebo (n=16).
RESULTS: No between group differences were observed in change from baseline on total Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score (25.98±2.81), in either of the Positive or Negative subscales of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), or on a global index of neurocognition. The possibility of practice and/or carry over effect could not be excluded. Methodological refinement (e.g., stratification of subjects based on baseline cognitive deficit) may have augmented assay sensitivity.

	abstract = {Most drugs of abuse increase dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and do so every time as a pharmacological response. Palatable food also releases accumbens-shell DA, but in naÃ¯ve rats the effect can wane during a long meal and disappears with repetition. Under select dietary circumstances, sugar can have effects similar to a drug of abuse. Rats show signs of DA sensitization and opioid dependence when given intermittent access to sucrose, such as alterations in DA and mu-opioid receptors, cross-sensitization with amphetamine and alcohol, and behavioral and neurochemical signs of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. The present experiment asks whether sucrose-dependent rats release DA each time they binge. We also predict that acetylcholine (ACh), which rises as the end of a meal, will be delayed in rats with intermittent access to sucrose. To create dependency, the experimental group (Daily Intermittent Sucrose) was maintained on a diet of 12-h food deprivation that extended 4 h into the dark, followed by 12-h access to a 10\% sucrose solution and chow, daily, for 21 days. As the main result, these rats gradually increased their sucrose intake from 37 to 112 ml per day (from 13 to 20 ml in the first hour of access), and repeatedly increased extracellular DA to 130\% of baseline as measured in the NAc shell by microdialysis during the first hour of sucrose access on day 1, day 2 and day 21. Three control groups failed to show a significant increase in extracellular DA on day 21: Sucrose only for 1 h on days 1 and 21 (Sucrose Twice), ad libitum access to sucrose and chow (Daily Ad libitum Sucrose), and intermittent chow instead of sucrose (Daily Intermittent Chow). Acetylcholine measured at the same time as DA, increased significantly toward the end and after each test meal in all groups. In the Daily Intermittent Sucrose group, the highest ACh levels (133\%) occurred during the first sample after the sucrose meal ended. In summary, sucrose-dependent animals have a delayed ACh satiation response, drink more sucrose, and release more DA than sucrose- or binge-experienced, but non-dependent animals. These results suggest another neurochemical similarity between intermittent bingeing on sucrose and drugs of abuse: both can repeatedly increase extracellular DA in the NAc shell.},

	abstract = {The endocannabinoid system is widespread throughout the central nervous system and its type 1 receptor (CB1) plays a crucial role in preventing the neurotoxicity caused by activation of glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Indeed, it is the activity of NMDARs themselves that provides the demands on the endogenous cannabinoids in order to control their calcium currents. Therefore, a physiological role of this system is to maintain NMDAR activity within safe limits, thereby protecting neural cells from excitotoxicity. Thus, cannabinoids may be able to control NMDAR overactivation-related neural dysfunctions; however, the major obstacles to the therapeutic utilization of these compounds are their psychotropic effects and negative influence on cognitive performance. Studies in humans have indicated that abuse of smoked cannabis can promote psychosis and even circumstantially precipitate symptoms of schizophrenia, although the latter appears to require a prior vulnerability in the individual. It is possible that cannabinoids provoke psychosis/schizophrenia reflecting a mechanism common to neuroprotection: the reduction of NMDAR activity. Cannabinoids are proposed to produce such effect by reducing the pre-synaptic release of glutamate or interfering with post-synaptic NMDAR-regulated signaling pathways. The efficacy of such control requires the endocannabinoid system to apply its negative influence in a manner that is proportional to the strength of NMDAR signaling. Thus, cannabinoids acting at the wrong time or exerting an inappropriate influence on their receptors may cause NMDAR hypofunction. The purpose of the present review is to draw the attention of the reader to the newly described functional and physical CB1–NMDAR association, which may elucidate the scenario required for the rapid and efficacious control of NMDAR activity. Whether alterations in these mechanisms may increase NMDAR hypofunction leading to vulnerability to schizophrenia will be outlined.},

It has sedative, anti-depressive, drive-enhancing and stress-modulated properties stimulating the distribution of dopamine and serotonin; in combination with other drugs, an increase of side effects and risk profile has to be expected.
METHODS: A case report is presented in order to illustrate the interaction between Rhodiola rosea and antidepressants.
RESULTS: We report the case of a 68-year-old female patient with recurrent moderate depressive disorder with somatic syndrome (ICD-10 F33.11) who developed vegetative syndrome, restlessness feeling and trembling since she began to ingest Rhodiola rosea in addition to paroxetine.
CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing Rhodiola rosea with paroxetine, pharmacokinetic and -dynamic interactions have to be assumed. The symptoms of the patient can be interpreted as a serotonergic syndrome. Because of its different effects, the plant is widely used. An increase of clinical relevant risks should be considered in the add-on treatments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antidepressants, aiming at monoaminergic neurotransmission, exhibit delayed onset of action, limited efficacy, and poor compliance. Glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in depression. However, it is unclear whether enhancement of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype glutamate receptor can be a treatment for depression.
METHODS: We studied sarcosine, a glycine transporter-I inhibitor that potentiates NMDA function, in animal models and in depressed patients. We investigated its effects in forced swim test, tail suspension test, elevated plus maze test, novelty-suppressed feeding test, and chronic unpredictable stress test in rats and conducted a 6-week randomized, double-blinded, citalopram-controlled trial in 40 patients with major depressive disorder. Clinical efficacy and side effects were assessed biweekly, with the main outcomes of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Global Assessment of Function, and remission rate. The time course of response and dropout rates was also compared.
RESULTS: Sarcosine decreased immobility in the forced swim test and tail suspension test, reduced the latency to feed in the novelty-suppressed feeding test, and reversed behavioral deficits caused by chronic unpredictable stress test, which are characteristics for an antidepressant. In the clinical study, sarcosine substantially improved scores of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression, and Global Assessment of Function more than citalopram treatment. Sarcosine-treated patients were much more likely and quicker to remit and less likely to drop out. Sarcosine was well tolerated without significant side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that enhancing NMDA function can improve depression-like behaviors in rodent models and in human depression. Establishment of glycine transporter-I inhibition as a novel treatment for depression waits for confirmation by further proof-of-principle studies.},

MPTP (30 mg/kg/day, 5 days)-lesioned mice showed deficits of habit learning memory and spatial memory, which were further aggravated by treatment with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) (25 mg/kg, 21 days). However, treatment with GP-EX (50 mg/kg, 21 days) ameliorated memory deficits in MPTP-lesioned mice treated with L-DOPA (25 mg/kg): GP-EX prevented the decreases in retention latency time in the passive avoidance test and tyrosine hydroxylase-immunopositive cells and dopamine levels in the nigrostriatum. GP-EX also reduced increases in retention transfer latency time of the elevated plus-maze test and expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and improved decreases in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus in the same models. By contrast, L-DOPA treatment (10 mg/kg, 21 days) ameliorated memory deficits in MPTP-lesioned mice, which were further improved by GP-EX treatment. These results suggest that GP-EX ameliorates habit learning memory deficits by activating dopaminergic neurons and spatial memory deficits by modulating NMDA receptor-ERK1/2-CREB system in MPTP-lesioned mice treated with L-DOPA. GP-EX may serve as an adjuvant phytonutrient for memory deficits in PD.},

This update considers the effect recent publications on snus use and health have on the overall evidence. The additional evidence extends the list of neoplastic conditions unassociated with snus use (oropharynx, oesophagus, stomach, lung) to include colorectal cancer and acoustic neuroma, and further undermines the weakly-based argument that snus use increases the risk of pancreatic cancer, although there is a report of poorer cancer survival in users. It remains undemonstrated that “snuff-dipper’s lesion” increases risk of oral cancer, and recent publications add to the evidence that snus use has no effect on periodontitis or dental caries. Although onset of acute myocardial infarction is not adversely associated with snus use, there is some evidence of an association with reduced survival. Whether this is a direct effect of snus use or a result of confounding by socioeconomic status or other factors requires further investigation, as does a report of an increased risk of heart failure in snus users. Even if some adverse health effects of snus use do exist, it remains clear that they are far less than those of smoking.},

DPCPX competitively antagonized both the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity via A1 adenosine receptors and the stimulation via A2 adenosine receptors. The Ki-values of this antagonism were 0.45 nM at the A1 receptor of rat fat cells, and 330 nM at the A2 receptor of human platelets, giving a more than 700-fold A1-selectivity. A similar A1-selectivity was determined in radioligand binding studies. Even at high concentrations, DPCPX did not significantly inhibit the soluble cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity of human platelets. [3H]DPCPX (105 Ci/mmol) bound in a saturable manner with high affinity to A1 receptors in membranes of bovine brain and heart, and rat brain and fat cells (KD-values 50-190 pM). Its nonspecific binding was about 1\% of total at KD, except in bovine myocardial membranes (about 10\%). Binding studies with bovine myocardial membranes allowed the analysis of both the high and low agonist affinity states of this receptor in a tissue with low receptor density. The binding properties of [3H]DPCPX appear superior to those of other agonist and antagonist radioligands for the A1 receptor.},

These changes may underlie the mechanism for developing morphine antinociceptive tolerance and physical dependence. We evaluated the effect of tianeptine, an antidepressant with prominent neuroprotective and neuroplastic properties, on the development of morphine antinociceptive tolerance and physical dependence. Male C57BL/6 mice were rendered tolerant to or dependent on morphine by subcutaneously injecting them with morphine (10 mg/kg) and intraperitoneally with saline or tianeptine (1, 3, or 5 mg/kg) twice daily for 6 days. The mice were given a daily tail-flick test 1 h after the first morphine injection to evaluate the development of their tolerance to morphine antinociception. To evaluate their physical dependence on morphine, 3 h after the final morphine injection on day 6, naloxone-HCl-precipitated (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) withdrawal symptoms were counted for 30 min, and body weight was checked 1 h after the naloxone injection. Tianeptine per se produced no antinociception, neither did it modify the antinociception produced by morphine, nor did it evoke the behavioral responses different from those in the saline controls. The combination of tianeptine with morphine significantly reduced the development of morphine antinociceptive tolerance and suppressed the incidence of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms. We conclude that tianeptine is an effective inhibitor of morphine-induced antinociceptive tolerance and physical dependence in mice. Our results would imply that comedication with tianeptine and morphine might benefit those who need long-term morphine treatment.},

There are few data available about the use of memantine in DLB.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year-old man was diagnosed with Alzheimer disease and parkinsonism. After memantine was started he developed severe fluctuations in awareness, visual hallucinations, agitation, and worsened parkinsonism. When he was evaluated thoroughly, the diagnosis was revised to Lewy body dementia, leading to changes in treatment that were associated with dramatic improvement in the patient's mental status.
CONCLUSIONS: In our patient, motor and cognitive symptoms worsened with memantine treatment; these resolved after memantine was discontinued.},

	abstract = {The prefrontal cortex is necessary for directing thought and planning action. Working memory, the active, transient maintenance of information in mind for subsequent monitoring and manipulation, lies at the core of many simple, as well as high-level, cognitive functions. Working memory has been shown to be compromised in a number of neurological and psychiatric conditions and may contribute to the behavioral and cognitive deficits associated with these disorders. It has been theorized that working memory depends upon reverberating circuits within the prefrontal cortex and other cortical areas. However, recent work indicates that intracellular signals and protein dephosphorylation are critical for working memory. The present article will review recent research into the involvement of the modulatory neurotransmitters and their receptors in working memory. The intracellular signaling pathways activated by these receptors and evidence that indicates a role for Gq-initiated PI-PLC and calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin activity in working memory will be discussed. Additionally, the negative influence of calcium- and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (i.e., calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), calcium/diacylglycerol-activated protein kinase C (PKC), and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)) activities on working memory will be reviewed. The implications of these experimental findings on the observed inverted-U relationship between D1 receptor stimulation and working memory, as well as age-associated working memory dysfunction, will be presented. Finally, we will discuss considerations for the development of clinical treatments for working memory disorders.},

Both zinc and copper are essential trace minerals that are acquired from the diet; under normal conditions the body protects against zinc overload, but at excessive dosages, copper deficiency has been seen. In order to examine the effect of enhanced metal administration on learning and memory, Sprague Dawley rats were given water supplemented with 10ppm Zn, 10ppm Zn+0.25ppm Cu, or normal lab water, during pre- and post-natal development. Fear conditioning tests at 4months showed significantly higher freezing rates during contextual retention and extinction and cued extinction for rats drinking water supplemented with zinc, suggesting increased anxiety compared to controls raised on lab water. During the MWM task at 9months, zinc-enhanced rats had significantly longer latencies to reach the platform compared to controls. The addition of copper to the zinc supplemented water brought freezing and latency levels closer to that of controls. These data demonstrate the importance of maintaining appropriate intake of both metals simultaneously, and show that long-term supplementation with zinc may cause alterations in memory.},

In some cases 5-HT is co-localized in the same nerve terminal with other neurotransmitters and reciprocal interactions take place. This review will focus on the modulatory action of 5-HT on the effects of glutamate and γ-amino-butyric acid (GABA), which are the principal neurotransmitters mediating respectively excitatory and inhibitory signals in the CNS. Examples of interaction at pre-and/or post-synaptic levels will be illustrated, as well as the receptors involved and their mechanisms of action. Finally, the physiological meaning of neuromodulatory effects of 5-HT will be briefly discussed with respect to pathologies deriving from malfunctioning of serotonin system.},

This decrease is corrected by fluoxetine in doses that improve depressive symptoms. Depression-like behavioral dysfunctions (aggression, fear, and anxiety) associated with a decrease of corticolimbic Allo content can be induced in mice by social isolation. In socially isolated mice, fluoxetine and analogs stereospecifically normalize the decrease of Allo biosynthesis and improve behavioral dysfunctions by a mechanism independent from 5-HT reuptake inhibition. Thus, fluoxetine and related congeners facilitate GABAA receptor neurotransmission and effectively ameliorate emotional and anxiety disorders and depression by acting as selective brain steroidogenic stimulants (SBSSs).},

	abstract = {As a result of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) concern about lead in the food supply, considerable data have been developed in recent years by FDA, other agencies, and industry on the levels of lead in foods. Data obtained on the lead content of milk, eggs, meat, fish, and shellfish indicate that the mean levels in these unprocessed foods varied from 0.02 to about 0.4 ppm, with the lowest level in milk. The major food processing source of lead in food is the lead-soldered can. FDA had assigned top priority to the reduction of lead in foods for infants because of their greater susceptibility to the toxic effects of this metal. The lead levels in foods for infants are now only 1/5 to 1/10 of what they were when FDA expressed its concern about lead to the manufacturers of canned infant formula, evaporated milk, canned infant juices, and glass-packed infant foods. FDA priority interest has now shifted to reduction of lead in adult canned foods, especially those eaten by young children. The mean levels in such foods have decreased from 0.35-0.40 ppm in 1974 to 0.20-0.25 ppm in 1980.},

The results showed that AST treatment significantly restored the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and increased glutathione (GSH) contents and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), but decreased malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonylation and 8-hydroxy-2- deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels in the brains of aging rats. Furthermore, AST increased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, but decreased the expression of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the brains of aging rats. Additionally, AST ameliorated histopathological changes in the hippocampus and restored brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in both the brains and hippocampus of aging rats. These results suggested that AST could alleviate brain aging, which may be due to attenuating oxidative stress, ameliorating hippocampus damage, and upregulating BDNF expression.},

This is particularly true in ocular diseases such as retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) and macular telangiectasia (MacTel), in which, despite the absence of large-scale leakage or hemorrhage, abnormal neovascularization (NV) is associated with local neuronal dysfunction. We describe here a retinal phenotype in mice with dysfunctional receptors for VLDL (Vldlr-/- mice) that closely resembles human retinal diseases in which abnormal intra- and subretinal NV is associated with photoreceptor cell death. Such cell death was evidenced by decreased cone and, to a lesser extent, rod opsin expression and abnormal electroretinograms. Cell death in the region of intraretinal vascular abnormalities was associated with an increased presence of markers associated with oxidative stress. Oral antioxidant supplementation protected against photoreceptor degeneration and preserved retinal function, despite the continued presence of abnormal intra- and subretinal vessels. What we believe to be novel, MÃ¼ller cell-based, virally mediated delivery of neurotrophic compounds specifically to sites of NV was also neuroprotective. These observations demonstrate that neuronal loss secondary to NV can be prevented by the use of simple antioxidant dietary measures or cell-based delivery of neurotrophic factors, even when the underlying vascular phenotype is not altered.},

However, it is unknown whether increased skeletal muscle mass (SMM) can prevent stroke. This study was designed to establish an association between SMM and brain white matter changes and/or silent infarction (WMC/SI). Methods: This was a community-based, cross-sectional study supported by the regional government. SMM measurements and brain computed tomography were performed in 722 stroke-free and dementia-free subjects (aged 50-75 years). Subjects were divided into four groups by SMM checked by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Odd ratios (ORs) of WMC/SI about higher SMM groups for the lowest SMM group were calculated. After 4 groups analysis, subjects were divided 2 groups and analyzed separately by gender. Result: In four groups analysis, unadjusted ORs of 2nd to 4th quartile were 0.616 (95[percnt] confidence interval [CI] 0.372-1.022 P=0.085), 0.290 (CI 0.159-0.530 P{\textless}0.001) and 0.209 (CI 0.108-0.403 P{\textless}0.001). Adjusted ORs for age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, education, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking were 0.994 (CI 0.513-1.740 P=0.085), 0.669 (CI 0.329-1.362 P=0.268) and 0.464 (CI 0.219-0.984 P=0.045). In two group analysis, unadjusted ORs for the higher muscle mass group was 0.313 (CI 0.200-0.491, P {\textless} 0.001). After adjustment, the OR were 0.577 (CI 0.340-0.979, P = 0.042). Seperating gender, adjustment OR were 0.351 (CI 0.141-0.869, P = 0.024) in men and 0.771 (CI 0.391-1.519, P = 0.452) in women. Conclusion: High SMM group had low WMC/SI, especially in men. Increased SMM by muscle strengthening exercise may prevent stroke.

	abstract = {UV radiation from sunlight is the most potent environmental risk factor in skin cancer pathogenesis. In the present study the ability of an algal extract to protect against UVA-induced DNA alterations was examined in human skin fibroblasts (1BR-3), human melanocytes (HEMAc) and human intestinal CaCo-2 cells. The protective effects of the proprietary algal extract, which contained a high level of the carotenoid astaxanthin, were compared with synthetic astaxanthin. DNA damage was assessed using the single cell gel electrophoresis or comet assay. In 1BR-3 cells, synthetic astaxanthin prevented UVA-induced DNA damage at all concentrations (10 nM, 100 nM, 10 microM) tested. In addition, the synthetic carotenoid also prevented DNA damage in both the HEMAc and CaCo-2 cells. The algal extract displayed protection against UVA-induced DNA damage when the equivalent of 10 microM astaxanthin was added to all three-cell types, however, at the lower concentrations (10 and 100 nM) no significant protection was evident. There was a 4.6-fold increase in astaxanthin content of CaCo-2 cells exposed to the synthetic compound and a 2.5-fold increase in cells exposed to algal extract. In 1BR-3 cells, exposure to UVA for 2 h resulted in a significant induction of cellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, coupled with a marked decrease in cellular glutathione (GSH) content. However pre-incubation (18 h) with 10 microM of the either the synthetic astaxanthin or the algal extract prevented UVA-induced alterations in SOD activity and GSH content. Similarly, in CaCo-2 cells a significant depletion of GSH was observed following UVA-irradiation which was prevented by simultaneously incubating with 10 microM of either synthetic astaxanthin or the algal extract. SOD activity was unchanged following UVA exposure in the intestinal cell line. This work suggests a role for the algal extract as a potentially beneficial antioxidant.},

	abstract = {Inflammation is a hot topic in medical research, because it plays a key role in inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other forms of arthritis, diabetes, heart diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, allergies, asthma, even cancer and many others. Over the past few decades, it was realized that the process of inflammation is virtually the same in different disorders, and a better understanding of inflammation may lead to better treatments for numerous diseases. Inflammation is the activation of the immune system in response to infection, irritation, or injury, with an influx of white blood cells, redness, heat, swelling, pain, and dysfunction of the organs involved. Although the pathophysiological basis of these conditions is not yet fully understood, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have often been implicated in their pathogenesis. In fact, in inflammatory diseases the antioxidant defense system is compromised, as evidenced by increased markers of oxidative stress, and decreased levels of protective antioxidant enzymes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An enriched diet containing antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, β-carotene and phenolic substances, has been suggested to improve symptoms by reducing disease-related oxidative stress. In this respect, the marine world represents a largely untapped reserve of bioactive ingredients, and considerable potential exists for exploitation of these bioactives as functional food ingredients. Substances such as n-3 oils, carotenoids, vitamins, minerals and peptides provide a myriad of health benefits, including reduction of cardiovascular diseases, anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. New marine bioactives are recently gaining attention, since they could be helpful in combating chronic inflammatory degenerative conditions. The aim of this review is to examine the published studies concerning the potential pharmacological properties and application of many marine bioactives against inflammatory diseases.},

Astaxanthin (AST), a xanthophyll carotenoid, exhibits diverse clinical benefits. The protective effects of AST against UV-induced apoptosis were investigated in the present study. Astaxanthin (5 μm) caused a significant decrease in the protein content and the mRNA levels of inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and decreased the release of prostaglandin E2 from HaCaT keratinocytes after UVB (20 mJ/cm(2) ) or UVC (5 mJ/cm(2) ) irradiation. No significant protective effects against UV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed in AST-pretreated cells. Astaxanthin caused a significant inhibition of UV-irradiation-induced apoptosis, as evidence by a DNA fragmentation assay. Furthermore, we found that the treatment with AST caused a reduction in the UVB- or UVC-induced protein and mRNA expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), IL-1β and TNF-α in HaCaT keratinocytes. These results suggest that AST effectively protects against UV-induced inflammation by decreasing iNOS and COX-2, and thereby inhibiting the apoptosis of keratinocytes.},

In 13 out of 34 nicotine gum or lozenge users from both studies, total NNN at one or more time points after biochemically confirmed smoking cessation was comparable to, or considerably higher than, the baseline levels. For most of the subjects who used the nicotine patch as a smoking cessation aid, urinary total NNN at all post-quit time points was less than 37\% of their mean baseline levels. These results indicate that endogenous formation of significant amounts of NNN may occur sporadically in some users of oral NRT.

	abstract = {Experiments on mice were performed to study the ability of monocationic and dicationic adamantane and phenylcyclohexyl derivatives to prevent the development of kindling induced by i.p. administration of pentylenetetrazol (Corasol, 35 mg/kg). The monocationic phenylcyclohexyl derivative IEM-1921 effectively slowed the development of kindling, this being seen over a wide range of doses (0.0001-0.1 micromol/kg). A monocationic adamantane derivative (memantine), also a selective non-competitive blocker of NMDA receptors, produced a similar effect at doses 100 times higher. The anticonvulsive activity of the dicationic phenylcyclohexyl derivative IEM-1925, which could block both types of glutamate receptors, differed from the activity of the monocationic derivative by having a more complex dose-response relationship. Thus, the development of kindling was suppressed by essentially the same doses as needed for the monocation IEM-1921 (0.001 micromol/kg). However, on reducing the dose by a factor of 10 (0.0001 micromol/kg), IEM-1925 facilitated the development of kindling. This difference in the prophylactic activities of selective NMDA receptor blockers and substances able to block both NMDA and AMPA receptors provides evidence that the mechanism of kindling involves both types of ionotropic glutamate receptor and the effects of compounds depend not only on the ratio of the contributions of these receptors, but also on the kinetic characteristics of the blocking action.},

	abstract = {Objective
Dietary-supplemented arginine has been shown to have positive effects on cardiovascular disease, but several drawbacks exist and could potentially be avoided by using L-citrulline, since it is recycled to L-arginine. However, citrulline is very rapidly metabolized. We therefore developed a sustained-release form of citrulline and evaluated its metabolic behavior in rats.
Methods
Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into three groups: receiving “empty microcapsule” (control group), 1 g/kg/d immediate-release citrulline (IR citrulline group), or 1 g/kg/d sustained-release citrulline (SR citrulline group). Citrulline was given each day at 9 a.m. after blood samples for 9 d, and on day 10, blood samples were drawn every 4 h to study the decrease in plasma amino acid concentrations.
Results
SR citrulline led to a sustained increase in citrullinemia and argininemia compared to IR citrulline, and on day 6 argininemia was significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) higher with SR compared to IR citrulline. Moreover, argininemia was significantly higher in the SR citrulline group than in controls throughout the study and SR citrulline maintained high argininemia and citrullinemia, at least over 12 h.
Conclusion
This experimental study provides a strong rationale for using this new formulation for atherosclerosis treatment.},

	abstract = {Our objective was to test the hypothesis that acute exposure of human skin vasculature to nicotine may have deleterious effects on endothelial function. Vasoconstriction and vasorelaxation in isolated perfused human skin flaps (approximately 8 x 18 cm) derived from dermolipectomy specimens were assessed by studying changes in skin perfusion pressure measured by a pressure transducer, and skin perfusion was assessed by a dermofluorometry technique (n = 4 or 5). It was observed that nicotine (10(-7) M) amplified (P {\textless} 0.05) the norepinephrine (NE)-induced concentration-dependent (10(-7)-10(-5) M) increase in skin vasoconstriction compared with the control. This amplification effect of nicotine in NE-induced skin vasoconstriction was not blocked by the nicotine-receptor antagonist hexamethonium (10(-6) M) or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10(-5) M). It was also observed that ACh and nitroglycerin (NTG) elicited a concentration-dependent (10(-8)-10(-5) M) vasorelaxation in skin flaps preconstricted with 8 x 10(-7) M of NE. The vasorelaxation induced by ACh was attenuated (P {\textless} 0.05) in the presence of nicotine (10(-7) M) compared with the control. However, skin vasorelaxation induced by NTG was not affected by nicotine (10(-7) M). ACh and NTG are known to induce endothelium-dependent and -independent vasorelaxation, respectively. The present findings were interpreted to indicate that acute exposure of human skin vasculature to nicotine was associated with 1) amplification of NE-induced skin vasoconstriction and 2) impairment of endothelium-dependent skin vasorelaxation. Cyclooxygenase products and nicotine receptors blocked by hexamethonium were not involved in the amplification of NE-induced skin vasoconstriction by nicotine. These findings may provide further insight into the pathogenesis of skin vasospasm in skin flap surgery and skin ischemic disease associated with cigarette smoking or use of smokeless tobacco.},

We found that L-theanine inhibited the rewarding effects of nicotine in a conditioned place preference (CPP) model of the mouse and reduced the excitatory status induced by nicotine in SH-SY5Y cells to the same extent as the nicotine receptor inhibitor dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHβE). Further studies using high performance liquid chromatography, western blotting and immunofluorescence staining analyses showed that L-theanine significantly inhibited nicotine-induced tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and dopamine production in the midbrain of mice. L-theanine treatment also reduced the upregulation of the α(4), β(2) and α(7) nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits induced by nicotine in mouse brain regions that related to the dopamine reward pathway, thus decreasing the number of cells that could react to nicotine. In addition, L-theanine treatment inhibited nicotine-induced c-Fos expression in the reward circuit related areas of the mouse brain. Knockdown of c-Fos by siRNA inhibited the excitatory status of cells but not the upregulation of TH induced by nicotine in SH-SY5Y cells. Overall, the present study showed that L-theanine reduced the nicotine-induced reward effects via inhibition of the nAChR-dopamine reward pathway.

	volume = {23},
	issn = {0785-3890},
	abstract = {The increasing popularity of sporting events, even for people on drug treatment, has raised the question of the interaction of exercise and pharmacokinetics. Exercise reduces splanchnic blood flow, but possible changes in the absorption of orally given drugs seem to be of minor clinical significance. Absorption from intramuscular, subcutaneou and transdermal application sites may be accelerated by exercise, possibly causing harmful consequences, e.g. in diabetics treated with insulin. Exercise or physical work increases the rate and depth of respiration thus increasing alveolar exchange of gases and vapours. Physical activity increases muscular blood flow and the binding of digoxin to muscular structures, with a simultaneous fall in the concentration of serum digoxin. Reduction in blood flow to adipose and other inactive tissues may delay the distribution of some drugs that are stored or removed by these tissues. The change from supine to upright position can affect the distribution of a drug. Exercise reduces the blood flow in the liver and deactivation of drugs with flow-limited (high clearance) hepatic metabolism such as nitrates and lidocaine. Metabolism of capacity-limited (low clearance) drugs, e.g. antipyrine, diazepam and amobarbital, is not influenced by exercise. Renal plasma flow, urine excretion rate and urine pH are also reduced by exercise. This is an important reason why the serum levels of drugs eliminated through the kidneys increase during physical stress. The changes in parenteral absorption and distribution volume of some drugs caused by exercise, as well as the short half-life of drugs, are properties resulting in altered therapeutic/toxic response in those drugs with a narrow therapeutic range.},

	abstract = {Background
Coffee and tea consumption was hypothesized to interact with variants of vitamin D-receptor polymorphisms, but limited evidence exists. Here we determine for the first time whether increased coffee and tea consumption affects circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in a cohort of Saudi adolescents.

Methods
A total of 330 randomly selected Saudi adolescents were included. Anthropometrics were recorded and fasting blood samples were analyzed for routine analysis of fasting glucose, lipid levels, calcium, albumin and phosphorous. Frequency of coffee and tea intake was noted. 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.

Results
Improved lipid profiles were observed in both boys and girls, as demonstrated by increased levels of HDL-cholesterol, even after controlling for age and BMI, among those consuming 9–12 cups of coffee/week. Vitamin D levels were significantly highest among those consuming 9–12 cups of tea/week in all subjects (p-value 0.009) independent of age, gender, BMI, physical activity and sun exposure.

Conclusion
This study suggests a link between tea consumption and vitamin D levels in a cohort of Saudi adolescents, independent of age, BMI, gender, physical activity and sun exposure. These findings should be confirmed prospectively.},

Investigations were undertaken to determine whether the VDR is required for the induction of signaling pathways that play an important role in this process. The induction of cWnt and hedgehog target genes that characterizes early anagen was found to be dramatically attenuated in VDR−/− mice, relative to wild-type (WT) mice. To determine whether this reflects impaired responsiveness to cWnt ligands, in vitro studies were performed in primary keratinocytes. These studies demonstrated impaired induction of cWnt target genes in response to Wnt3a in VDR−/− keratinocytes, relative to wild-type keratinocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that the VDR was recruited to the regulatory regions of cWnt and hedgehog target genes in WT keratinocytes but not in VDR−/− or Lef1−/− keratinocytes. Lef1 was enriched on these same regulatory regions in WT keratinocytes but not in VDR−/− keratinocytes. In vivo studies were performed to determine whether activation of the hedgehog pathway could bypass the defect in cWnt signaling observed in the absence of the unliganded VDR. In WT, but not VDR−/−, mice, hedgehog agonist treatment resulted in an induction of cWnt and hedgehog target genes and the generation of mature anagen hair follicles. Thus, these studies demonstrate that the unliganded VDR interacts with regulatory regions in the cWnt and hedgehog target genes and is required for the induction of these pathways during the postnatal hair cycle.},

Inhibitory learning theory (ILT) provides a novel foundation for understanding how exposure therapy reduces fear. Moreover, ILT is consistent with empirical evidence that raises questions about the more traditional (i.e., habituation) explanation for exposure therapy's efficacy. Yet ILT has yet to be applied to understanding the treatment of OCD and its heterogeneity. The current review is an examination of human experimental research on ILT that seeks to translate laboratory findings on fear extinction to exposure therapy across empirically established OCD symptom dimensions. We provide an up-to-date critical review of the existing evidence for a series of strategies derived from ILT that have been proposed for the treatment of fear, discuss the limitations of existing studies, and provide suggestions for future research within this rapidly accelerating area of study. We also offer conceptual considerations for applying these principles to the treatment of OCD symptom dimensions. A common theme is the idea of introducing "desirable difficulties" into the implementation of exposure in order to foster more durable long-term learning.},

Renewal describes the recovery of an extinguished response if the context of extinction differs from the context of recall. Animal studies have demonstrated that prefrontal, but not hippocampal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonism disrupted extinction learning and processing of task context. However, human studies of NMDAR in extinction learning are lacking, while NMDAR antagonism yielded contradictory results in other learning tasks. This fMRI study investigated the role of NMDAR for human behavioral and brain activation correlates of extinction and renewal. Healthy volunteers received a single dose of the NMDAR antagonist memantine prior to extinction of previously acquired stimulus-outcome associations presented in either identical or novel contexts. We observed better, and partly faster, extinction learning in participants receiving the NMDAR antagonist compared to placebo. However, memantine did not affect renewal. In both extinction and recall, the memantine group showed a deactivation in extinction-related brain regions, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, while hippocampal activity was increased. This higher hippocampal activation was in turn associated with the participants' body mass index (BMI) and extinction errors. Our results demonstrate potentially dose-related enhancing effects of memantine and highlight involvement of hippocampal NMDAR in context-related extinction learning.},

However, the similarity of its mechanism of action to other NMDA receptor antagonists has led to concerns that it may also have neurotoxic effects. To assess both the neuroprotective and neurotoxic potential of memantine in a mouse model of AD (Tg2576 mice), we used quantitative light and electron microscopy to investigate the effects of long-term (6 months) administration of memantine (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) on plaque deposition and neuronal morphology in the hippocampus and overlying cortex. A fear-conditioning paradigm was used to evaluate the behavioral consequences of any observed changes in structure. Administration of the two higher doses of memantine (10 and 20 mg/kg) was associated with a significant decrease in β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque deposition, increases in synaptic density and the appearance of degenerating axons; the latter two effects were independent of genotype. Administration of the lowest dose of memantine (5 mg/kg) was associated with a significant decrease in Aβ plaque deposition and a significant increase in synaptic density, but not a significant increase in degenerating axons. However, memantine did not significantly improve behavioral deficits associated with genotype in a fear-conditioning paradigm at any dose. These results suggest that chronic memantine administration may have both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects in a mouse model of AD.},

Because most individual studies focus on a small number of proteins, many complexities of the relationships among proteins and their dynamic responses to stimulation are not known. We have used the technique of reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) to assess the levels of more than 80 proteins/protein modifications in subcellular fractions from hippocampus and cortex of mice trained in Context Fear Conditioning (CFC). Proteins include components of signaling pathways, several encoded by immediate early genes or involved in apoptosis and inflammation, and subunits of glutamate receptors. At one hour after training, levels of more than half the proteins had changed in one or more fractions, among them multiple components of the Mitogen-activated protein kinase, MAPK, and Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin, MTOR, pathways, subunits of glutamate receptors, and the NOTCH pathway modulator, NUMB homolog (Drosophila). Levels of 37 proteins changed in the nuclear fraction of hippocampus alone. Abnormalities in levels of thirteen proteins analyzed have been reported in brains of patients with Alzheimer's Disease. We therefore further investigated the protein profiles of mice treated with memantine, a drug approved for treatment of AD. In hippocampus, memantine alone induced many changes similar to those seen after CFC and altered the levels of seven proteins associated with Alzheimer's Disease abnormalities. Lastly, to further explore the relevance of these datasets, we superimposed responses to CFC and memantine onto components of the long term potentiation pathway, a process subserving learning and memory formation. Fourteen components of the long term potentiation pathway and 26 proteins interacting with components responded to CFC and/or memantine. Together, these datasets provide a novel view of the diversity and complexity in protein responses and interactions following normal learning.},

The approaches for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using rodent models have focused on the extinction and reconsolidation of recent, but not remote, memories. Here we show that, following prolonged re-exposure to the conditioning context, enhancers of hippocampal neurogenesis, including MEM, promote forgetting of remote contextual fear memory. However, these interventions are ineffective following shorter re-exposures. Importantly, we find that long, but not short re-exposures activate gene expression in the hippocampus and induce hippocampus-dependent reconsolidation of remote contextual fear memory. Furthermore, remote memory retrieval becomes hippocampus-dependent after the long-time recall, suggesting that remote fear memory returns to a hippocampus dependent state after the long-time recall, thereby allowing enhanced forgetting by increased hippocampal neurogenesis.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is often refractory to treatment. Glutamatergic neurotransmission modulating agents like memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor open channel blocker (antagonist), has been reported to be beneficial in OCD.

Materials and Methods:
Twelve subjects of OCD who had been on various medications for over 5 years, but were poor responders, were enrolled for a 12-week open-label trial with fixed dose trial of memantine as an augmenting agent. The OCD symptoms and adverse effects of the drug were monitored.

Results:
Out of
12 subjects, eight had clear benefit, with reduction of 25\% or more on Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, and there were no side-effects with the medication,

Conclusion:
Memantine may be beneficial for treatment-resistant OCD as an augmenting agent.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A substantial proportion of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) do not respond to, or are intolerant of, standard treatments. Additional treatment strategies are therefore necessary. Excessive action of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate may play a role in the pathophysiology of OCD and possibly GAD. Memantine blocks the excitatory action of glutamate at the N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor under pathological conditions. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of memantine in OCD and GAD, and to probe relative effects on OCD and anxiety symptoms.
METHOD: Ten OCD and 7 GAD subjects received 12 weeks of open-label memantine 10 mg twice daily, as either monotherapy or augmentation of their existing medication. Primary outcome measures were the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( YBOCS) for the OCD group, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) for the GAD group, and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale (CGII) for both groups.
RESULTS: The OCD group experienced a significant mean 40.6\% reduction in YBOCS scores at endpoint (t = 4.75, p {\textless} 0.001). Three of 10 of OCD subjects were classified as responders, although 7 of 10 experienced a {\textgreater}/= 45\% reduction in YBOCS scores. The GAD group experienced a mean 22.4\% reduction in HARS scores (t = 3.56, p = 0.012). None of the GAD subjects were responders, and none experienced a {\textgreater}/= 50\% reduction in HARS scores. Memantine was well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse effects.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that memantine may have preferential efficacy in the treatment of OCD versus GAD. These preliminary findings warrant larger, placebo-controlled studies in OCD.},

	abstract = {Senescent cells accumulate with aging and at sites of pathology in multiple chronic diseases. Senolytics are drugs that selectively promote apoptosis of senescent cells by temporarily disabling the pro-survival pathways that enable senescent cells to resist the pro-apoptotic, pro-inflammatory factors that they themselves secrete. Reducing senescent cell burden by genetic approaches or by administering senolytics delays or alleviates multiple age- and disease-related adverse phenotypes in preclinical models. Reported senolytics include dasatinib, quercetin, navitoclax (ABT263), and piperlongumine. Here we report that fisetin, a naturally-occurring flavone with low toxicity, and A1331852 and A1155463, selective BCL-XL inhibitors that may have less hematological toxicity than the less specific BCL-2 family inhibitor navitoclax, are senolytic. Fisetin selectively induces apoptosis in senescent but not proliferating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). It is not senolytic in senescent IMR90 cells, a human lung fibroblast strain, or primary human preadipocytes. A1331852 and A1155463 are senolytic in HUVECs and IMR90 cells, but not preadipocytes. These agents may be better candidates for eventual translation into clinical interventions than some existing senolytics, such as navitoclax, which is associated with hematological toxicity.},

	abstract = {REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ nuclear receptors regulate several physiological processes, including circadian rhythm and metabolism. A previous study reported the REV-ERBα gene to be co-overexpressed with ERBB2 in breast cancer cell lines. Surprisingly, we found that several tumor types, including a number of breast cancer cell lines, predominantly express the REV-ERBβ variant. This pattern was independent of ERBB2 and ER status, and opposite to that of non-cancer mammary epithelial HMEC cells, in which REV-ERBα was the major variant. Consistent with this molecular profile, REV-ERB target genes in both circadian and metabolic pathways were derepressed upon silencing of REV-ERBβ, but not REV-ERBα. Strikingly, we found that REV-ERBβ is a determinant of sensitivity to chloroquine, a clinically relevant lysosomotropic agent that suppresses autophagy. The cytoprotective function of REV-ERBβ appears to operate downstream of autophagy blockade. Through compound screening, we identified ARN5187, a novel lysosomotropic REV-ERBβ ligand with a dual inhibitory activity toward REV-ERB-mediated transcriptional regulation and autophagy. Remarkably, although ARN5187 and chloroquine share similar lysosomotropic potency and have a similar effect on autophagy inhibition, ARN5187 is significantly more cytotoxic. Collectively, our results reveal that dual inhibition of REV-ERBβ and autophagy is an effective strategy for eliciting cytotoxicity in cancer cells. Furthermore, our discovery of a novel inhibitor compound of both REV-ERB and autophagy may provide a scaffold for the discovery of new multifunctional anticancer agents.},

Insulin secretion requires magnesium: magnesium deficiency results in impaired insulin secretion while magnesium replacement restores insulin secretion. Furthermore, experimental magnesium deficiency reduces the tissues sensitivity to insulin. Subclinical magnesium deficiency is common in diabetes. It results from both insufficient magnesium intakes and increase magnesium losses, particularly in the urine. In type 2, or non-insulin-dependent, diabetes mellitus, magnesium deficiency seems to be associated with insulin resistance. Furthermore, it may participate in the pathogenesis of diabetes complications and may contribute to the increased risk of sudden death associated with diabetes. Some studies suggest that magnesium deficiency may play a role in spontaneous abortion of diabetic women, in fetal malformations and in the pathogenesis of neonatal hypocalcemia of the infants of diabetic mothers. Administration of magnesium salts to patients with type 2 diabetes tend to reduce insulin resistance. Long-term studies are needed before recommending systematic magnesium supplementation to type 2 diabetic patients with subclinical magnesium deficiency.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Melatonin is a hormone that regulates circadian rhythm, and its levels decline with age. As melatonin levels decrease, older adults are prone to develop disorders related to an altered circadian rhythm. The effective dose of melatonin supplementation in these disorders remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to define the optimal dosage of exogenous melatonin administration in disorders related to altered melatonin levels in older adults aged 55 years and above by determining the dose-response effect of exogenous administered melatonin on endogenous levels.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review through PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase, both from 1980 until November 2013. Included articles studied the effect of exogenous melatonin administration on endogenous melatonin levels in either serum, urine, or saliva in humans aged 55 years and above.
RESULTS: We included 16 articles, nine of which were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The mean age varied from 55.3 to 77.6 years. Melatonin dosage varied from 0.1 mg to 50 mg/kg and was administered orally in all studies. Pre- and post-intervention levels revealed a significant elevation of the post-intervention melatonin levels in a dose-dependent fashion. The maximum concentrations measured in serum and urine were all elevated compared with placebo, and a higher elevation in older adults than in younger adults was demonstrated. Even though there were no differences between times to reach maximum concentration in serum and urine, melatonin levels with higher doses were maintained longer above a certain threshold than were lower doses.
CONCLUSION: In older adults, we advise the use of the lowest possible dose of immediate-release formulation melatonin to best mimic the normal physiological circadian rhythm of melatonin and to avoid prolonged, supra-physiological blood levels.},

Six healthy male volunteers (age range 22-24 years) participated in this study, after signing an informed consent form.

Prior to each experimental session and in the following morning, subjects completed a sleep quality questionnaire, the Profile of Mood States, the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and underwent a visual reaction test. Significant decrease on sleep latencies was found following melatonin treatment at 18:00 and 20:00 hr. In addition, melatonin tended to improve sleep efficiency and to reduce intermittent wakefulness. However, at 21:00 hr, 0.3 mg melatonin increased latency to sleep onset and 1.0 mg melatonin had no effect on sleep variables. Furthermore, melatonin given at different times did not alter subjective sleepiness, mood, and reaction time in the following morning. The results from the present study support the notion that administration of low doses of melatonin, mimicking the nocturnal physiological concentration of this hormone may exert immediate sleep-inducing effects.},

The importance of magnesium and the positive effects of magnesium supplementation are extensively documented in magnesium deficiency, e.g., cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. The effectiveness of oral magnesium supplementation for the treatment of magnesium deficiency has been studied in detail. However, the proven and well-documented oral magnesium supplementation has become questioned in the recent years through intensive marketing for its transdermal application (e.g., magnesium-containing sprays, magnesium flakes, and magnesium salt baths). In both, specialist and lay press as well as on the internet, there are increasing numbers of articles claiming the effectiveness and superiority of transdermal magnesium over an oral application. It is claimed that the transdermal absorption of magnesium in comparison to oral application is more effective due to better absorption and fewer side effects as it bypasses the gastrointestinal tract.},

	abstract = {Context:
Stress is a state of mental or emotional strain or tension, which can lead to underperformance and adverse clinical conditions. Adaptogens are herbs that help in combating stress. Ayurvedic classical texts, animal studies and clinical studies describe Ashwagandha as a safe and effective adaptogen.

Aims:
The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high-concentration full-spectrum extract of Ashwagandha roots in reducing stress and anxiety and in improving the general well-being of adults who were under stress.

Settings and Design:
Single center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

Materials and Methods:
A total of 64 subjects with a history of chronic stress were enrolled into the study after performing relevant clinical examinations and laboratory tests. These included a measurement of serum cortisol, and assessing their scores on standard stress-assessment questionnaires. They were randomized to either the placebo control group or the study drug treatment group, and were asked to take one capsule twice a day for a period of 60 days. In the study drug treatment group, each capsule contained 300 mg of high-concentration full-spectrum extract from the root of the Ashwagandha plant. During the treatment period (on Day 15, Day 30 and Day 45), a follow-up telephone call was made to all subjects to check for treatment compliance and to note any adverse reactions. Final safety and efficacy assessments were done on Day 60.

Statistical Analysis:
t-test, Mann-Whitney test.

Results:
The treatment group that was given the high-concentration full-spectrum Ashwagandha root extract exhibited a significant reduction (P{\textless}0.0001) in scores on all the stress-assessment scales on Day 60, relative to the placebo group. The serum cortisol levels were substantially reduced (P=0.0006) in the Ashwagandha group, relative to the placebo group. The adverse effects were mild in nature and were comparable in both the groups. No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study suggest that a high-concentration full-spectrum Ashwagandha root extract safely and effectively improves an individual's resistance towards stress and thereby improves self-assessed quality of life.},

Thirty-three female acne patients were randomly divided into two groups and treated for six months with an oral contraceptive containing 0.030 mg ethinylestradiol (EE) plus 0.150 mg levonorgestrel or 0.150 mg levonorgestrel. After six months' treatment a 30\% decrease in DHEA-S levels were observed in the desogestrel/EE group and a 15\% decrease in the levonorgestrel/EE group; the difference was not statistically significant. At the same time serum total cortisol increased by 75-100\% and free testosterone fell by 30-40\% in both groups, whereas SHBG elevated 250\% in the desogestrel/EE group and 30\% in the levonorgestrel/EE group. Acne improved significantly in both groups, desogestrel/EE showing greater improvement. A decrease in SHBG and increase in DHEA-S levels appear to be the most common hormonal changes in acne.

	volume = {219},
	issn = {1432-2072},
	doi = {10.1007/s00213-011-2440-z},
	abstract = {RATIONALE: L-Theanine (N-ethyl-L: -glutamine) is an amino acid uniquely found in green tea and historically considered to be a relaxing agent. It is a glutamate derivative and has an affinity for glutamatergic receptors. However, its psychotropic effects remain unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To elucidate effects of L: -theanine on psychiatric disease-related behaviors in mice and its molecular basis focusing on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) receptor.
METHODS: We examined the effects of L: -theanine on behaviors in mice by using the open-field test (OFT), forced swim test (FST), elevated plus-maze test (EPMT), and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle. By western blot analysis, we looked at the effect of L: -theanine on the expression of BDNF and related proteins in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. To determine whether L: -theanine has agonistic action on the NMDA receptor, we performed Fluo-3 intracellular Ca(2+) imaging in cultured cortical neurons.
RESULTS: Single administration of L: -theanine significantly attenuated MK-801-induced deficits in PPI. Subchronic administration (3-week duration) of L: -theanine significantly reduced immobility time in the FST and improved baseline PPI. Western blotting analysis showed increased expression of BDNF protein in the hippocampus after subchronic administration of L: -theanine. In cultured cortical neurons, L: -theanine significantly increased the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, and this increase was suppressed by competitive and non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists (AP-5 and MK-801, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that L: -theanine has antipsychotic-like and possibly antidepressant-like effects. It exerts these effects, at least in part, through induction of BDNF in the hippocampus and the agonistic action of L: -theanine on the NMDA receptor.},

	abstract = {Theanine (n-ethylglutamic acid), a non-proteinaceous amino acid component of green and black teas, has received growing attention in recent years due to its reported effects on the central nervous system. It readily crosses the blood-brain barrier where it exerts a variety of neurophysiological and pharmacological effects. Its most well-documented effect has been its apparent anxiolytic and calming effect due to its up-regulation of inhibitory neurotransmitters and possible modulation of serotonin and dopamine in selected areas. It has also recently been shown to increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. An increasing number of studies demonstrate a neuroprotective effects following cerebral infarct and injury, although the exact molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Theanine also elicits improvements in cognitive function including learning and memory, in human and animal studies, possibly via a decrease in NMDA-dependent CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) and increase in NMDA-independent CA1-LTP. Furthermore, theanine administration elicits selective changes in alpha brain wave activity with concomitant increases in selective attention during the execution of mental tasks. Emerging studies also demonstrate a promising role for theanine in augmentation therapy for schizophrenia, while animal models of depression report positive improvements following theanine administration. A handful of studies are beginning to examine a putative role in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and theoretical extrapolations to a therapeutic role for theanine in other psychiatric disorders such as anxiety disorders, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and bipolar disorder are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background
Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can damage the developing fetus, illustrated by central nervous system dysfunction and deficits in motor and cognitive abilities. Binge drinking has been associated with an increased risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, likely due to increased episodes of ethanol withdrawal. We hypothesized that overactivity of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor during ethanol withdrawal leads to excitotoxic cell death in the developing brain. Consistent with this, administration of NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g. MK-801) during withdrawal can attenuate ethanol's teratogenic effects. The aim of this study was to determine if administration of memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, during ethanol withdrawal could effectively attenuate ethanol-related deficits, without the adverse side effects associated with other NMDA receptor antagonists.

Methods
Sprague-Dawley pups were exposed to 6.0 g/kg ethanol or isocaloric maltose solution via intubation on postnatal day 6, a period of brain development equivalent to a portion of the 3rd trimester. Twenty-four and 36 hours after ethanol, subjects were injected with 0, 10 or 15 mg/kg memantine, totaling doses of 0, 20, or 30 mg/kg. Motor coordination was tested on a parallel bar task and the total number of cerebellar Purkinje cells was estimated using unbiased stereology.

Results
Alcohol exposure induced significant parallel bar motor incoordination and reduced Purkinje cell number. Memantine administration significantly attenuated both ethanol-associated motor deficits and cerebellar cell loss in a dose-dependent manner.

Conclusions
Memantine was neuroprotective when administered during ethanol withdrawal. These data provide further support that ethanol withdrawal contributes to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.},

	abstract = {The enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract secrete 400 times as much melatonin as the pineal gland; therefore, it is not surprising that research is finding that this indole plays an important role in GI functioning. In animal studies, it protects against GI ulcerations, and randomized clinical trials suggest its efficacy in treating functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. Melatonin administration has been shown to protect against esophageal lesions in animals. Moreover, in a randomized, single-blind clinical trial of subjects with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the combination of melatonin with other natural supplements was found to be superior to omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Its administration as a single treatment for GERD has not been previously reported. A 64-year-old Caucasian female who required treatment with a PPI for symptoms of GERD wished to substitute a natural treatment because of the risk of worsening her osteoporosis. She experienced a return of symptoms following each of three 20-day trials of a proprietary blend of D-limonene when attempts were made to discontinue the PPI. She then underwent a trial of a natural formula consisting of melatonin 6 mg, 5-hydroxytryptophan 100 mg, D,L-methionine 500 mg, betaine 100 mg, L-taurine 50 mg, riboflavin 1.7 mg, vitamin B6 0.8 mg, folic acid 400 microg, and calcium 50 mg. After 40 days, the PPI was withdrawn without a return of symptoms. Subsequently, an attempt to reduce melatonin to 3 mg resulted in symptoms, while all other ingredients were withdrawn with minimal symptoms during 10 months of follow-up.},

	abstract = {Background
Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) defined as a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. Many drugs are used for the treatment of GERD such as omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) which is a widely used antiulcer drug demonstrated to protect against esophageal mucosal injury. Melatonin has been found to protect the gastrointestinal mucosa from oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species in different experimental ulcer models. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of exogenous melatonin in the treatment of reflux disease in humans either alone or in combination with omeprazole therapy.

Methods
36 persons were divided into 4 groups (control subjects, patients with reflux disease treated with melatonin alone, omeprazole alone and a combination of melatonin and omeprazole for 4 and 8 weeks) Each group consisted of 9 persons. Persons were subjected to thorough history taking, clinical examination, and investigations including laboratory, endoscopic, record of esophageal motility, pH-metry, basal acid output and serum gastrin.

Results
Melatonin has a role in the improvement of Gastro-esophageal reflux disease when used alone or in combination with omeprazole. Meanwhile, omeprazole alone is better used in the treatment of GERD than melatonin alone.

Conclusion
The present study showed that oral melatonin is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of GERD. It is an effective line of treatment in relieving epigastric pain and heartburn. However, further studies are required to confirm the efficacy and long-term safety of melatonin before being recommended for routine clinical use.

Here, we investigated whether or not L-threonate could attenuate DHT-induced DKK-1 expression. We observed via RT-PCR analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that DHT-induced DKK-1 expression was attenuated in the presence of L-threonate. We also found that DHT-induced activation of DKK-1 promoter activity was significantly repressed by L-threonate. Moreover, a co-culture system featuring outer root sheath (ORS) keratinocytes and DPCs showed that DHT inhibited the growth of ORS cells, which was then significantly reversed by L-threonate. Collectively, these results indicate that L-threonate inhibited DKK-1 expression in DPCs and therefore is a good treatment for the prevention of androgen-driven balding.},

Our EEG analyses of whole day recordings revealed that modafinil reduce ENS of this nocturnal PD models with levodopa medications. Therefore, we investigated whether, modafinil post-treatment followed by MPTP shows any effect on monoamine contents of brain and found to robustly increased noradrenaline (NA) concentration of MPTP treated mice. Modafinil post-treatment, in neurorestorative context (5 days post-lesion) led to increased striatal dopamine (DA) concentrations of MPTP-treated mice.

	abstract = {Conclusion and Summary A number of substances were tested against Ps. pyocyanea (Ps. œruginosa) and their bactericidal concentration determined. The quaternary ammonium compounds, although bactericidal, are not recommended because of their effect on the cornea. The mercurial compounds:—thiomersalate 0·005 per cent, and phenylmercuric acetate and nitrate 0·005 per cent., are safe, and are recommended for eserine and sodium fluorescein, which are the most liable to pyocyanea contamination, also for methylcellulose eye-drops, which are liable to contamination by moulds. These compounds are not only powerful bactericides but are also fungicides. Chlorbutol in saturated solution (about 0·8 per cent.) is safe and recommended, but owing to the fact that the solution cannot be heated without detriment to the preservative its use needs great care. Chlorcresol 0·1 per cent, is safe, but in that concentration it causes smarting, and 0·03 per cent, kills pyocyanea within 24 hours. The p-hydroxybenzoates in 0·1 per cent, solution are reliable for most of the eye-drops used except fluorescein. Phenylethyl alcohol is safe in 0·5 per cent, concentration but much quicker in its action at 0·6 per cent., and further clinical trials are needed with this promising preservative. For cortisone eye-drops 0·9 per cent, of benzyl alcohol, the one used in the original solution, is recommended. Eye-drops used in hospital wards, outpatient departments and factory medical rooms, should be prepared with bactericidal preservatives, but for eye-drops used by individual patients, a bacteriostatic agent may be permissible. However, for reasons of safety and to make it as foolproof as possible a uniform procedure using a bactericidal preservative is recommended. Up to now the National Formulary has recommended the use of bacteriostatic agents only. In view of the increasing incidence of eye infections reported by different authorities from many parts of the world, more stringent standards seem desirable.},

	abstract = {Substances derived from biotransformation of non-steroid antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) produced by patients responsive to the biological liquid oxidant activity (BLOA) test, have been shown to have anticataract activity. They are all aromatic alcohols with physico-chemical properties similar to benzyl alcohols (BA); they were very efficacious in preventing in vitro (cyanate, heat) cataracts and in vivo (uveitis, radiation, selenite) cataracts but had no effect on sugar cataracts. The mechanism underlying this effect seems to be mainly antioxidant together with a stabilizing effect on lens membrane integrity and a stimulating effect on Na-K ATPase and membrane sodium pump. The well balanced lipo- and hydro-solubility of these compounds makes them very suitable for topical application to the eye as lipid solubility is the major factor governing transcorneal penetration of drugs. In the two long-term double blind studies on humans described here, comparing BA, placebo and Catalin in the topical treatment of progressive cataract rapid (2-3 weeks treatment) reversal of incipient cataract was obtained accompanied by a marked improvement of vision and by a significantly lower percentage of eyes requiring surgery after 22 months treatment with BA than with placebo and Catalin. In conclusion, further studies on the effect on the eye of BA and similar compounds such as phenyl-ethanol are advisable especially because they are already used as preservatives in eye-drop formulations.},

We further show that single doses of 100, 300 and 1,000â€‰mg of NR produce dose-dependent increases in the blood NAD+ metabolome in the first clinical trial of NR pharmacokinetics in humans. We also report that nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD), which was not thought to be en route for the conversion of NR to NAD+, is formed from NR and discover that the rise in NAAD is a highly sensitive biomarker of effective NAD+ repletion.,

Furthermore, in the treated cells growing beyond the original Hayflick limit, the levels of p53, p21WAF1, and phospho-Rb proteins were similar to those in actively proliferating cells. The nicotinamide treatment caused a decrease in ATP levels, which was stably maintained until the delayed senescence point. Nicotinamide-treated cells also maintained high mitochondrial membrane potential but a lower respiration rate and superoxide anion level. Taken together, in contrast to its demonstrated pro-aging effect in yeast, nicotinamide extends the lifespan of human fibroblasts, possibly through reduction in mitochondrial activity and ROS production.},

	doi = {10.4103/0973-1296.176061},
	abstract = {Background:
Caffeine and L-theanine are pharmacologically important constituents of tea, especially due to their effects on the central nervous system. The effects of these two compounds are opposite: While caffeine is a well-known stimulant, theanine has a relaxing effect. Tea processing may influence the caffeine and theanine content of tea leaves.

Objective:
The aim of our work was to quantify these constituents from a set of commercial products to reveal the possible correlations of caffeine and theanine content and processing methods.

Materials and Methods:
Theanine and caffeine contents of 37 commercial white, green, oolong, black, and pu-erh tea samples were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector.

Results:
The mean L-theanine content of white, green, oolong, and black teas were 6.26, 6.56, 6.09, and 5.13 mg/g, respectively. The same values for caffeine content were 16.79, 16.28, 19.31, and 17.73 mg/g.

Conclusion:
Though the effect of processing on theanine content was evident, quantification for these analytes does not seem to be a good criterion to discriminate the different types of tea. Caffeine content provided no information on the effect of processing, and the theanine content of the samples was rather variable, independently from the type of the tea. The quantitative analysis of caffeine and theanine is essential to assess the stimulating effect of the tea, however, for chemical profiling further secondary metabolites have to be determined.

SUMMARY

Thirty-seven commercial white, green, oolong, black, and pu-erh tea samples were analyzed for caffeine and theanine contentWhile the caffeine content was similar, the theanine contents of black teas were slightly lower and practically zero in pu-erhThe great variability of these two compound within the tea categories allows no discrimination of tea types based solely on theanine and caffeine quantificationContrary to the previous data, the way of processing has no determining effect on theanine content.

Caffeine contents of black teas (22−28 mg/g of DM) were significantly higher than in less fermented green teas (11−20 mg/g of DM). The relative concentration of the five major tea catechins ranked EGCG {\textgreater} ECG {\textgreater} EC {\textgreater} EGC {\textgreater} C. The estimated U.K. dietary intakes of total tea catechins, calculated on the basis of an average tea consumption of three cups of tea (200 mL cup, 1\% tea leaves w/v), were 61.5, 92.7, and 405.5 mg/day from fruit teas, black teas, and green teas, respectively. The coefficients of variation were 19.4, 88.6, and 17.3\%, respectively, indicating the wide variation in these intakes. The calculated caffeine intake ranged between 92 and 146 mg/day. In addition, many individuals will consume much larger quantities of tea, of various strengths (as determined by the brewing conditions employed). This broad spread of U.K. daily intakes further emphasizes the need for additional research to relate intake and effect in various population groups.

The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis in humans that an oral dose of ethanol would lead to dopamine release in the ventral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens. Six healthy subjects underwent two [(11)C]raclopride PET scans following either alcohol (1 ml/kg) in orange juice or orange juice alone. Subjective mood changes, heart rate, and blood-alcohol levels were monitored throughout the procedure. Personality traits were evaluated using the tridimensional personality questionnaire. PET images were co-registered with MRI and transformed into stereotaxic space. Statistical parametric maps of [(11)C]raclopride binding potential change were generated. There was a significant reduction in [(11)C]raclopride binding potential bilaterally in the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens in the alcohol condition compared to the orange juice condition, indicative of increased extracellular dopamine. Moreover, the magnitude of the change in [(11)C]raclopride binding correlated with the alcohol-induced increase in heart rate, which is thought to be a marker of the psychostimulant effects of the drug, and with the personality dimension of impulsiveness. The present study is the first report that, in humans, alcohol promotes dopamine release in the brain, with a preferential effect in the ventral striatum. These findings support the hypothesis that mesolimbic dopamine activation is a common property of abused substances, possibly mediating their reinforcing effects.},

	abstract = {We review preclinical and clinical evidences strongly suggesting that memantine, an old drug currently approved for Alzheimerâ€™s dementia, is an effective treatment for acute mania and for the prevention of manic/hypomanic and depressive recurrences of manic-depressive illness. Lithium remains the first line for the treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar disorders, but currently available treatment alternatives for lithium resistant patients are of limited and/or questionable efficacy. Thus, research and development of more effective mood stabilizer drugs is a leading challenge for modern psychopharmacology. We have demonstrated that 21 d administration of imipramine causes a behavioural syndrome similar to a cycle of bipolar disorder, i.e., a mania followed by a depression, in rats. Indeed, such treatment causes a behavioural supersensitivity to dopamine D2 receptor agonists associated with an increase sexual activity and aggressivity (mania). The dopamine receptor sensitization is followed, after imipramine discontinuation, by an opposite phenomenon (dopamine receptor desensitization) and an increased immobility time (depression) in the forced swimming test of depression. Memantine blocks the development of the supersensitivity and the ensuing desensitization associated with the depressive like behavior. On the basis of these observations we have suggested the use of memantine in the treatment of mania and in the prophylaxis of bipolar disorders. To test this hypothesis we performed several naturalistic studies that showed an acute antimanic effect and a long-lasting and progressive mood-stabilizing action (at least 3 years), without clinically relevant side effects. To confirm the observations of our naturalistic trials we are now performing a randomized controlled clinical trial. Finally we described the studies reporting the efficacy of memantine in manic-like symptoms occurring in psychiatric disorders other than bipolar. Limitations: A randomized controlled clinical trial is needed to confirm our naturalistic observations. Conclusion: We believe that this review presents enough pharmacological and clinical information to consider the administration of memantine in the treatment of bipolar disorders that no respond to standard mood stabilizers.},

[3H]GABA microinjected into partietal cortex area 2 (Par2) of the rat brain was eliminated from the brain with an apparent elimination half-life of 16.9 min. The blood–brain barrier (BBB) efflux clearance of [3H]GABA was at least 0.153 mL/min/g brain, which was calculated from the elimination rate constant (7.14 × 10−2 min−1) and the distribution volume in the brain (2.14 mL/g brain). Direct comparison of the apparent BBB influx clearance [3H]GABA (9.29 µL/min/g brain) and the apparent efflux clearance (153 µL/min/g brain) indicated that the efflux clearance was at least 16-fold greater than the influx clearance. In order to reduce the effect of metabolism in the neuronal cells following intracerebral microinjection, we determined the apparent efflux of [3H]GABA in the presence of nipecotic acid, a GABA transport inhibitor in parenchymal cells, using the BEI method. Under such conditions, the elimination of [3H]GABA across the BBB showed saturation and inhibition by probenecid in the presence of nipecotic acid. Furthermore, the uptake of [3H]GABA by MBEC4 cells was inhibited by GABA, taurine, β-alanine and nipecotic acid in a concentration-dependent manner. It is likely that GABA inhibits the first step in the abluminal membrane uptake by brain endothelial cells, and that probenecid selectively inhibits the luminal membrane efflux transport process from the brain capillary endothelial cells based on the in vivo and in vitro evidence. The BBB acts as the efflux pump for GABA to reduce the brain interstitial fluid concentration.},

Thus, coadministration of probiotics with drugs may lead to changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drugs. In this study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen in mice treated with probiotics. Oral administration of probiotics changed the gut microbiota composition in the mice. Of these probiotics, Lactobacillus reuteri K8 increased the numbers of clostridia, bifidobacteria, and enterococci, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus K9 decreased the number of bifidobacteria, determined by culturing in selective media. Next, we performed a pharmacokinetic study of acetaminophen in mice orally treated with K8 and K9 for 3 days. Treatment with K8 reduced the area under the curve (AUC) of orally administered acetaminophen to 68.4\% compared with normal control mice, whereas K9 did not affect the AUC of acetaminophen. Oral administration to mice of K8, which degraded acetaminophen, increased the degradation of acetaminophen by gut microbiota, whereas K9 treatment did not affect it. Treatment with K8 increased the number of L. reuteri adhered in the upper small intestine, whereas the number of L. rhamnosus was not affected by treatment with K8 or K9. K8 increased the number of cyanobacteria, whereas K9 increased the number of deferribacteres. These results suggest that the intake of probiotics may make the absorption of orally administered drugs fluctuate through the disturbance of gut microbiota-mediated drug metabolism and that the subsequent impact on microbiota metabolism could result in altered systemic concentrations of the intact drug.},

We now report that hyperforin also has N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonistic effects. Hyperforin (10 microM) was found to inhibit the NMDA-induced calcium influx into cortical neurons. In rat hippocampal slices, hyperforin inhibited the NMDA-receptor-mediated release of choline from phospholipids. Hyperforin also antagonized the increase of water content in freshly isolated hippocampal slices, and it counteracted, at 3 and 10 microM, the increase of water content induced by NMDA. Hyperforin was inactive, however, in two in vivo models of brain edema formation, middle cerebral artery occlusion and water intoxication in mice. In conclusion, hyperforin has NMDA-receptor-antagonistic and potential neuroprotective effects in vitro. This effect may contribute to the therapeutic effectiveness of St. John's wort extracts in some situations, for example, for relapse prevention in alcoholism.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Hypericum perforatum is, with Ginkgo biloba, one of the most frequently prescribed medicinal plants in the world. Its popular name, St. John's wort (SJW), is due to the fact that its flowers, yellow, are gathered around the feast of St. John the Baptist (24th June) whereas "wort" is an old English word for plant. Of interest, SJW possesses antidepressant actions and is currently used to alleviate symptoms of mild to moderate depression. Nearly two dozens of bioactive compounds have been isolated from SJW. Hypericin, originally described as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor type A, was thought to be responsible for the antidepressant properties of SJW extracts. However, subsequent studies could not confirm this observation and hyperforin, a phloroglucinol derivative, was shown to display antidepressive properties. Indeed, the efficiency of the extracts of SJW has been reported to be dependent on the concentration of hyperforin. However, its effects on brain cells and on the mechanisms underlying its putative clinical antidepressant effect remain poorly characterized.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review article is to propose an overview of the recent scientific publications that have provided new and relevant insights into the neurobiological actions of hyperforin.
RESULTS: Hyperforin has been described as an inhibitor of the reuptake of many neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin or glutamate. It is thus a potent modulator of synaptic transmission. In addition, it blocks the activity of many receptors such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. More recently, hyperforin has been shown to activate TRPC6, a Ca(2+)-conducting channel of the plasma membrane, which is the only channel opened by this molecule. Interestingly, the other transient receptor potential channels of C type (TRPC) isoforms (TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC5 and TRPC7) are insensitive to hyperforin. Due to this specific property, it is now used as a convenient pharmacological tool to investigate the functions of endogenous TRPC6 channels in various cell types. Chronically applied to neuronal cell line PC12, hyperforin promotes the extension of neurites via a mechanism implying TRPC6 channels. It is also known to trigger an intracellular signalling pathway that involves the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and the transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB). This leads to an up-regulation of the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor neurotrophic tyrosine kinase (TrkB) and TRPC6. This hyperforin-dependent cascade is controlled by Ca(2+) ions and occurs specifically in the cortex but not in the hippocampus. One key aspect of the cellular responses induced by hyperforin is its impact on the homeostasis of several cations (Na(+), Ca(2+), Zn(2+) and H(+)). In vitro experiments demonstrated that hyperforin, which changes the fluidity of membranes, elevates the intracellular concentration of these elements by promoting their influx and/or their release from internal compartments.
CONCLUSION: The phloroglucinol derivative hyperforin is an important bioactive molecule of Hypericum perforatum exhibiting antidepressive properties. Although it inhibits the reuptake of many neurotransmitters, hyperforin is in fact a multi-target drug influencing the cellular homeostatic mechanisms of Ca(2+), Zn(2+), H(+) and Na(+) due to its effects on their influx and/or release from internal stores. In addition, hyperforin is a potent modulator of mitochondrial functions. In spite of recent progress in the characterization of the cellular hyperforin responses, it remains unclear what pharmacological aspects of hyperforin functions are relevant in vivo.},

METHODS: Sixteen healthy women were treated with a low-dose OC (Loestrin 1/20) and a placebo for two consecutive 28-day cycles in a single-blind sequential trial. Treatment with St John's Wort 300 mg three times daily was then added for two additional 28-day cycles. Outcomes compared between control and treatment cycles included the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol, daily bleeding diaries, follicle growth, changes in cervical mucus and progesterone levels drawn at 7- to 10-day intervals.
RESULTS: Treatment with St. John's Wort was associated with a significant 13-15\% reduction in the dose exposure from the contraceptive. Breakthrough bleeding increased in the treatment cycles, as did evidence of follicle growth and probable ovulation.
CONCLUSION: St. John's Wort is associated with increased metabolism of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol, breakthrough bleeding, follicle growth and ovulation. Women using OCs should be cautioned that St. John's Wort might interfere with contraceptive effectiveness.},

	abstract = {GABAB receptors are the G-protein–coupled receptors for GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. GABAB receptors are abundant on dendritic spines, where they dampen postsynaptic excitability and inhibit Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors when activated by spillover of GABA from neighboring GABAergic terminals. Here, we show that an excitatory signaling cascade enables spines to counteract this GABAB-mediated inhibition. We found that NMDA application to cultured hippocampal neurons promotes dynamin-dependent endocytosis of GABAB receptors. NMDA-dependent internalization of GABAB receptors requires activation of Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which associates with GABAB receptors in vivo and phosphorylates serine 867 (S867) in the intracellular C terminus of the GABAB1 subunit. Blockade of either CaMKII or phosphorylation of S867 renders GABAB receptors refractory to NMDA-mediated internalization. Time-lapse two-photon imaging of organotypic hippocampal slices reveals that activation of NMDA receptors removes GABAB receptors within minutes from the surface of dendritic spines and shafts. NMDA-dependent S867 phosphorylation and internalization is predominantly detectable with the GABAB1b subunit isoform, which is the isoform that clusters with inhibitory effector K+ channels in the spines. Consistent with this, NMDA receptor activation in neurons impairs the ability of GABAB receptors to activate K+ channels. Thus, our data support that NMDA receptor activity endocytoses postsynaptic GABAB receptors through CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of S867. This provides a means to spare NMDA receptors at individual glutamatergic synapses from reciprocal inhibition through GABAB receptors.},

	abstract = {How do antidepressants elicit an antidepressant response? Here, we review accumulating evidence that the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serves as a transducer, acting as the link between the antidepressant drug and the neuroplastic changes that result in the improvement of the depressive symptoms. Over the last decade several studies have consistently highlighted BDNF as a key player in antidepressant action. An increase in hippocampal and cortical expression of BDNF mRNA parallels the antidepressant-like response of conventional antidepressants such as SSRIs. Subsequent studies showed that a single bilateral infusion of BDNF into the ventricles or directly into the hippocampus is sufficient to induce a relatively rapid and sustained antidepressant-like effect. Importantly, the antidepressant-like response to conventional antidepressants is attenuated in mice where the BDNF signaling has been disrupted by genetic manipulations. Low dose ketamine, which has been found to induce a rapid antidepressant effect in patients with treatment-resistant depression, is also dependent on increased BDNF signaling. Ketamine transiently increases BDNF translation in hippocampus, leading to enhanced synaptic plasticity and synaptic strength. Ketamine has been shown to increase BDNF translation by blocking NMDA receptor activity at rest, thereby inhibiting calcium influx and subsequently halting eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase leading to a desuppression of protein translation, including BDNF translation. The antidepressant-like response of ketamine is abolished in BDNF and TrkB conditional knockout mice, eEF2 kinase knockout mice, in mice carrying the BDNF met/met allele, and by intra-cortical infusions of BDNF-neutralizing antibodies. In summary, current data suggests that conventional antidepressants and ketamine mediate their antidepressant-like effects by increasing BDNF in forebrain regions, in particular the hippocampus, making BDNF an essential determinant of antidepressant efficacy.},

This review provides a brief overview of the role of L-tryptophan in protein synthesis and a number of other metabolic functions. With emphasis on L-tryptophan’s role in synthesis of brain serotonin, details are provided on the research uses of L-tryptophan, particularly L-tryptophan depletion, and on clinical trials that have been conducted using L-tryptophan supplementation. The ability to change the rates of serotonin synthesis in the brain by manipulating concentrations of serum tryptophan is the foundation of much research. As the sole precursor of serotonin, experimental research has shown that L-tryptophan’s role in brain serotonin synthesis is an important factor involved in mood, behavior, and cognition. Furthermore, clinical trials have provided some initial evidence of L-tryptophan’s efficacy for treatment of psychiatric disorders, particularly when used in combination with other therapeutic agents.},

	abstract = {Vitamin C ascorbic acid) is a well-known antioxidant that is involved in anxiety, stress, depression, fatigue and mood state in humans. Studies have suggested that oxidative stress may trigger neuropsychological disorders. Antioxidants may play an important therapeutic role in combating the damage caused by oxidative stress in individuals that suffer from anxiety. In this context, it was hypothesized that oral vitamin C supplementation would reduce anxiety. However, few up to date studies have evaluated the consequences of oral vitamin C supplementation on anxiety in humans. The present study examined the effects of oral vitamin C supplements in 42 high school students, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The students were given either vitamin C (500 mg day(-1)) or placebo. Plasma concentrations of vitamin C and blood pressure were measured before the intervention and then one day after the intervention. Anxiety levels were evaluated for each student before and after 14 days following supplementation with the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Results showed that vitamin C reduced anxiety levels and led to higher plasma vitamin C concentration compared to the placebo. The mean heart rates were also significantly different between vitamin C group and placebo control group. Present study results not only provide evidence that vitamin C plays an important therapeutic role for anxiety but also point a possible use for antioxidants in the prevention or reduction of anxiety. This suggests that a diet rich in vitamin C may be an effective adjunct to medical and psychological treatment of anxiety and improve academic performance.},

	abstract = {Background/objective: Allergic diseases, such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and psychiatric disorders are major health issues. There have been reports that allergic diseases were associated with depression or anxiety disorders. This study aimed to investigate the association between these allergic diseases and the risk of developing overall psychiatric disorders in patients from Taiwan. Methods: This cohort study used the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) Program. A total of 186,588 enrolled patients, with 46,647 study subjects who had suffered from allergic diseases, and 139,941 controls matched for sex and age, from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Dataset of 2000-2015, were selected from a sub-dataset of the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Fine \& Grayâ€™s competing risk model analysis was used to explore the hazard ratio (HR), and 95\% confidence interval (CI), for the risk of allergic diseases being associated with the risk of developing psychiatric disorders during the 15 years of follow-up. Results: Of the study subjects, 5,038 (10.8\%) developed psychiatric disorders when compared to 9,376 (6.7\%) in the control group, with significant difference (p {\textless} 0.001). Fine and Gray's competing risk model analysis revealed that the adjusted HR was 1.659 (95\% CI= 1.602 - 1.717, p {\textless} 0.001). In this study, we found that the groups of atopic dermatitis alone, and the allergic rhinitis + atopic dermatitis were associated with a lower risk of psychiatric disorders, but all the other four groups, as bronchial asthma alone, allergic rhinitis alone, bronchial asthma + allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma + atopic dermatitis, and the combination of all these three allergic diseases were associated with a higher risk of psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: Allergic diseases are therefore associated with a 1.66-fold increased hazard of psychiatric disorders in Taiwan.},

	abstract = {Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human cortex. The food supplement version of GABA is widely available online. Although many consumers claim that they experience benefits from the use of these products, it is unclear whether these supplements confer benefits beyond a placebo effect. Currently, the mechanism of action behind these products is unknown. It has long been thought that GABA is unable to cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier (BBB), but the studies that have assessed this issue are often contradictory and range widely in their employed methods. Accordingly, future research needs to establish the effects of oral GABA administration on GABA levels in the human brain, for example using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. There is some evidence in favor of a calming effect of GABA food supplements, but most of this evidence was reported by researchers with a potential conflict of interest. We suggest that any veridical effects of GABA food supplements on brain and cognition might be exerted through BBB passage or, more indirectly, via an effect on the enteric nervous system. We conclude that the mechanism of action of GABA food supplements is far from clear, and that further work is needed to establish the behavioral effects of GABA.},

The study revealed no significant interaction of ptersotilbene with GABA, serotonin, or cannabinoid receptors. In an attempt to clarify the mechanism underlying the in vivo anxiolytic action of pterostilbene, the compound was evaluated for potential inhibition of FAAH and MAGL, enzymes primarily responsible for degradation of endocannabinoids. Results revealed that pterostilbene exerted a concentration dependent inhibition of the human recombinant FAAH enzyme, with an IC50 value of 5.42 ± 0.26 μM, with no significant inhibition of the MAGL enzyme. These results suggest that pterostilbene has the potential to become a candidate compound for therapeutic drug development for anxiety disorders.},

Study included 60 subjects who were undergoing infertility screening and were found to be suffering from psychological stress, assessed on the basis of a questionnaire and elevated serum cortisol levels. Age-matched 60 healthy men having normal semen parameters and who had previously initiated at least one pregnancy were included as controls. Infertile subjects were administered with M. pruriens seed powder (5 g dayâˆ’1) orally. For carrying out morphological and biochemical analysis, semen samples were collected twice, first before starting treatment and second after 3 months of treatment. The results demonstrated decreased sperm count and motility in subjects who were under psychological stress. Moreover, serum cortisol and seminal plasma lipid peroxide levels were also found elevated along with decreased seminal plasma glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic acid contents and reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity. Treatment with M. pruriens significantly ameliorated psychological stress and seminal plasma lipid peroxide levels along with improved sperm count and motility. Treatment also restored the levels of SOD, catalase, GSH and ascorbic acid in seminal plasma of infertile men. On the basis of results of the present study, it may be concluded that M. pruriens not only reactivates the anti-oxidant defense system of infertile men but it also helps in the management of stress and improves semen quality.},

VIDEO SUMMARY
----------------------------
COMT helps breakdown catecholamines like norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. In addition, it helps break down estrogen. 

A COMT polymorphism (COMT Val158Met) can slow COMT down which increase susceptibility to higher norepinephrine, dopamine, or estrogen levels. 

SAMe and Magnesium are the cofactors for COMT. Some people feel better when taking SAMe and some do better with hydroxocobalamin.

It has to do with how their methylation cycle is working - and also downstream nutrients. One must support downstream - and also upstream prior to giving certain nutrients - especially COMT.

I've seen patients do VERY well with SAMe and others horribly.

Understanding their biochemistry and genetic makeup - and history - is needed. One needs all of this information.

One cannot treat a gene in ISOLATION. It's not recommended.

	abstract = {Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is the prototypical psychedelic drug, but its effects on the human brain have never been studied before with modern neuroimaging. Here, three complementary neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) measures, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), implemented during resting state conditions, revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF), decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations, implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining its hallucinatory quality. LSD’s marked effects on the visual cortex did not significantly correlate with the drug’s other characteristic effects on consciousness, however. Rather, decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings of “ego-dissolution” and “altered meaning,” implying the importance of this particular circuit for the maintenance of “self” or “ego” and its processing of “meaning.” Strong relationships were also found between the different imaging metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about their functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific research with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results contribute important new insights into the characteristic hallucinatory and consciousness-altering properties of psychedelics that inform on how they can model certain pathological states and potentially treat others.},

On the other hand, many neurotrophins, like nerve growth factor (NGF), paired off restorative effects with hyperalgesia. Interestingly, the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factors GDNF and Artemin (ARTN) seem to support neuron survival and to normalize abnormal pain behaviour. In the present research protein levels of NGF, GDNF and ARTN were evaluated in a rat model of peripheral neuropathy, the chronic constriction injury (CCI). NGF was increased by CCI in the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglia (DRG), in the spinal cord and in the periaqueductal grey matter (PAG). On the contrary, ARTN was decreased bilaterally in DRG, spinal cord and PAG. GDNF levels decreased in ipsilateral DRG, whereas the constriction did not modify its expression in the central nervous system districts. Repeated treatments with the antihyperalgesic and neuroregenerative compound acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR; 100 mgkg(-1) i.p. twice daily for 15 days) was able to prevent the increase of NGF levels. In conditions of pain relief ALCAR normalized peripheral and central alterations of GDNF and ARTN levels. Characteristically, sham animals that underwent the same ALCAR treatment, showed increased levels of ARTN both in the DRG and in the spinal cord. These data offer a new point of view on the mechanism of the antihyperalgesic as well as the neuroprotective effect of ALCAR.},

	abstract = {Senescence of the central nervous system is characterized by a progressive loss of neurons that can result in physiological and behavioral impairments. Reduction in the levels of central neurotrophic factors or of neurotrophin receptors may be one of the causes of the onset of these degenerative events. Thus, a proper therapeutic approach would be to increase support to degenerating neurons with trophic factors or to stimulate endogenous neurotrophic activity. Here we report that acetyl-L-carnitine arginine amide (ST-857) is able to stimulate neurite outgrowth in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells in a manner similar to that elicited by nerve growth factor (NGF). Neurite induction by ST-857 requires de novo mRNA synthesis and is independent of the action of several common trophic factors. The integrity of the molecular structure of ST-857 is essential for its activity, as the single moieties of the molecule have no effect on PC12 cells, whether they are tested separately or together. Also, minor chemical modifications of ST-857, such as the presence of the arginine moiety at a position other than the amino one, completely abolish its neuritogenic effect. Lastly, the presence of ST-857 in the culture medium competes with the high affinity NGF binding in a dose dependent fashion. These results, although preliminary, are suggestive of a possible role for ST-857 in the development of therapeutic strategies to counteract degenerative diseases of the CNS.},

When curcumin was given alone, in the dose 2 g/kg to rats, moderate serum concentrations were achieved over a period of 4 h. Concomitant administration of piperine 20 mg/kg increased the serum concentration of curcumin for a short period of 1-2 h post drug. Time to maximum was significantly increased (P {\textless} 0.02) while elimination half life and clearance significantly decreased (P {\textless} 0.02), and the bioavailability was increased by 154\%. On the other hand in humans after a dose of 2 g curcumin alone, serum levels were either undetectable or very low. Concomitant administration of piperine 20 mg produced much higher concentrations from 0.25 to 1 h post drug (P {\textless} 0.01 at 0.25 and 0.5 h; P {\textless} 0.001 at 1 h), the increase in bioavailability was 2000\%.

Theanine also repressed phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calcium ionophore A23187-induced TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 secretion by suppressing NF-κB activation. Furthermore, theanine suppressed the activation of caspase-1 and the expression of receptor interacting protein-2.

	abstract = {The histaminergic system is exclusively localized within the posterior hypothalamus with projection to almost all the major regions of the central nervous system. Strong and consistent evidence exist to suggest that histamine, acting via H₁ and/or H₃ receptor has a pivotal role in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness. Administration of histamine or H₁ receptor agonists induces wakefulness, whereas administration of H₁ receptor antagonists promotes sleep. The H₃ receptor functions as an auto-receptor and regulates the synthesis and release of histamine. Activation of H₃ receptor reduces histamine release and promotes sleep. Conversely, blockade of H₃ receptor promotes wakefulness. Histamine release in the hypothalamus and other target regions is highest during wakefulness. The histaminergic neurons display maximal activity during the state of high vigilance, and cease their activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The cerebrospinal levels of histamine are reduced in diseased states where hypersomnolence is a major symptom. The histamine deficient L-histidine decarboxylase knockout (HDC KO) mice display sleep fragmentation and increased REM sleep during the light period along with profound wakefulness deficit at dark onset, and in novel environment. Similar results have been obtained when histamine neurons are lesioned. These studies strongly implicate the histaminergic neurons of the TMN to play a critical role in the maintenance of high vigilance state during wakefulness.},

Epicatechin, the cocoa major monomeric flavan-3-ol, is considered to contribute to these cardio-protective effects. We investigated effects of pure epicatechin supplementation on gene expression profiles of immune cells in humans. In a double blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial, 32 (pre)hypertensive subjects aged 30 to 80, received two 4-week interventions, i.e. epicatechin (100mg/day) or placebo with a 4-week wash-out between interventions. Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were determined before and after both interventions. Epicatechin regulated 1180 genes, of which 234 differed from placebo. Epicatechin upregulated gene sets involved in transcription and tubulin folding and downregulated gene sets involved in inflammation, PPAR signalling and adipogenesis. Several negatively enriched genes within these gene sets were involved in insulin signalling. Most inhibited upstream regulators within the epicatechin intervention were cytokines or involved in inflammation. No upstream regulators were identified compared to placebo. Epicatechin, a cocoa flavan-3-ol, reduces gene expression involved in inflammation, PPAR-signalling and adipogenesis in immune cells. Effects were mild but our findings increase our understanding and provide new leads on how epicatechin rich products like cocoa may affect immune cells and exert cardiometabolic protective effects.},

	volume = {233},
	issn = {1879-1484},
	doi = {10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2013.12.027},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous studies investigating flavanol-rich foods provide indications for potential cardioprotective effects of these foods, but the effects of individual flavanols remain unclear. We investigated whether the flavanol epicatechin can reduce diet-induced atherosclerosis, with particular emphasis on the cardiovascular risk factors dyslipidaemia and inflammation.
METHODS: ApoE*3-Leiden mice were fed a cholesterol-containing atherogenic diet with or without epicatechin (0.1\% w/w) to study effects on early- and late-stage atherosclerosis (8 w and 20 w). In vivo effects of epicatechin on diet-induced inflammation were studied in human-CRP transgenic mice and NFκB-luciferase reporter mice.
RESULTS: Epicatechin attenuated atherosclerotic lesion area in ApoE*3-Leiden mice by 27\%, without affecting plasma lipids. This anti-atherogenic effect of epicatechin was specific to the severe lesion types, with no effect on mild lesions. Epicatechin mitigated diet-induced increases in plasma SAA (in ApoE*3-Leiden mice) and plasma human-CRP (in human-CRP transgenic mice). Microarray analysis of aortic gene expression revealed an attenuating effect of epicatechin on several diet-induced pro-atherogenic inflammatory processes in the aorta (e.g. chemotaxis of cells, matrix remodelling), regulated by NFκB. These findings were confirmed immunohistochemically by reduced lesional neutrophil content in HCE, and by inhibition of diet-induced NFκB activity in epicatechin-treated NFκB-luciferase reporter mice.
CONCLUSION: Epicatechin attenuates development of atherosclerosis and impairs lesion progression from mild to severe lesions in absence of an effect on dyslipidaemia. The observed reduction of circulating inflammatory risk factors by epicatechin (e.g. SAA, human-CRP), as well as its local anti-inflammatory activity in the vessel wall, provide a rationale for epicatechin's anti-atherogenic effects.},

	abstract = {Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are major public health concerns. Visceral adipose tissue inflammation is considered a significant contributor to obesity-associated T2D development. We previously showed that the flavan-3-ol (−)-epicatechin (EC) can mitigate insulin resistance in mice fed a high fat diet (HFD). This study investigated the capacity of EC to inhibit visceral adipose tissue inflammation occurring as a consequence of HFD consumption in C57BL/6J mice, and characterized the underlying mechanisms. In association with the development of obesity and insulin resistance, HFD consumption caused inflammation in the visceral adipose tissue as evidenced by activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB and increased tissue levels of the macrophage marker F4/80, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and the chemokine MCP-1. EC supplementation mitigated all these events. In addition, we observed activation of the three branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR), and upregulation of NADPH oxidases NOX4 and NOX2 in visceral fat of mice fed HFD. These can account, at least in part, for the associated oxidative stress and activation of the redox sensitive NF-κB. Notably, EC supplementation mitigated this and the release of pro-inflammatory proteins from metabolically stressed adipocytes. Attenuation of adipocyte endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress by EC could contribute to decreased inflammation and improved visceral adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. Our results support the concept that consumption of EC-rich foods could mitigate obesity-associated insulin resistance through attenuation of adipose tissue inflammation.},

The aim of this study is to investigate the bioavailability of five different magnesium compounds (magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, magnesium acetyl taurate, magnesium citrate, and magnesium malate) in different tissues. Following a single dose 400 mg/70 kg magnesium administration to Sprague Dawley rats, bioavailability was evaluated by examining time-dependent absorption, tissue penetration, and the effects on the behavior of the animals. Pharmacokinetically, the area under the curve calculation is highest in the magnesium malate. The magnesium acetyl taurate was found to have the second highest area under the curve calculation. Magnesium acetyl taurate was rapidly absorbed, able to pass through to the brain easily, had the highest tissue concentration level in the brain, and was found to be associated with decreased anxiety indicators. Magnesium malate levels remained high for an extended period of time in the serum. The commonly prescribed dietary supplements magnesium oxide and magnesium citrate had the lowest bioavailability when compared to our control group. More research is needed to investigate the bioavailability of magnesium malate and acetyl taurate compounds and their effects in specific tissues and on behavior.},

STUDY DESIGN: In experiment 1 34 female Long-Evans rats were divided into six groups: control (n = 7); single magnesium sulfate injection and evaluation after 20 minutes in 3 conditions: normal rats (n = 7), sham-operated animals (n = 5), and after electrical stimulation by hippocampal electrode (n = 5); single injection and evaluation after 2 hours (n = 5); and prolonged (2 hours) serum magnesium elevation (n = 5). Serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and specific brain areas were analyzed for magnesium concentrations. In experiment 2 threshold for electrical seizure was measured in eight rats before and after intraperitoneal injections of magnesium sulfate versus saline solution.
RESULTS: In experiment 1 there was a significant correlation between blood and cerebrospinal fluid magnesium concentrations (r = 0.80, p {\textless} 0.0001). Magnesium concentrations were increased in the cortex and hippocampus, with the largest changes occurring after two hours of sustained serum magnesium concentrations (p {\textless} 0.01). Induction of hippocampal seizure activity resulted in further elevations in cerebrospinal fluid magnesium concentrations but did not change brain concentrations. In experiment 2 magnesium sulfate increased the electrical threshold required to induce seizures by 34\% (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Magnesium sulfate enters the cerebrospinal fluid and brain and has a central anticonvulsant effect.},

Sleep polysomnogram (PSG) and heart rate variability (HRV) were also measured. Subjects performed 2-h intermittent physical exercise with a bicycle ergometer at ZT3 or at ZT10 for four consecutive days, where zeitgeber time 0 (ZT0) was the time of wake-up. The rising phase of plasma melatonin rhythm was delayed by 1.1 h without exercise. Phase-delay shifts of a similar extent were detected by morning and evening exercise. But the falling phase shifted only after evening exercise by 1.0 h. The sleep PSG did not change after morning exercise, while Stage 1+2 sleep significantly decreased by 13.0\% without exercise, and RE sleep decreased by 10.5\% after evening exercise. The nocturnal decline of rectal temperature was attenuated by evening exercise, but not by morning exercise. HRV during sleep changed differentially. Very low frequency (VLF) waves increased without exercise. VLF, low frequency (LF), and high frequency (HF) waves increased after morning exercise, whereas HR increased after evening exercise. Morning exercise eventually enhanced the parasympathetic activity, as indicated by HRV, while evening exercise activated the sympathetic activity, as indicated by increase in heart rate in the following nocturnal sleep. These findings indicated differential effects of morning and evening exercise on the circadian melatonin rhythm, PSG, and HRV.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to compare the effects of acute morning or evening exercise on nocturnal sleep in individuals with two subjective insomnia symptoms: difficulty in initiating sleep (DIS), and early morning awakening (EMA), separately for the first vs the second halves of the night.
METHODS: Older individuals (55-65 years old) with DIS (N = 15) or EMA (N = 15) and age- and sex-matched controls (N = 13) participated in this non-randomized crossover study. Participants were assigned to two exercise conditions (morning exercise and evening exercise) in counterbalanced order following the baseline condition with a two-week interval between conditions. A single session of aerobic step exercise was performed during each exercise condition. Nocturnal polysomnography was carried out to evaluate objective sleep quality. Patient global impression of change scale scores for nocturnal sleep were obtained to subjectively evaluate the different groups.
RESULTS: Acute physical exercise did not improve subjective sleep quality. Morning exercise decreased the number of stage shifts over the whole night. The arousal index and the number of stage shifts were decreased especially during the second half of the night in all groups. Furthermore, morning exercise decreased the number of wake stages during the second half of the night in the DIS group, but not in the EMA group.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute morning exercise can improve nocturnal sleep quality in individuals with difficulty initiating sleep, especially during the later part of the night.},

	abstract = {Background
During nocturnal sleep, blood pressure (BP) “dips” compared to diurnal BP, reducing stress on the cardiovascular system. Both the hypotensive response elicited by acute aerobic exercise and sleep quality can impact this dipping response.

Purpose
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of aerobic exercise timing on circadian BP changes and sleep architecture.

Materials and methods
Twenty prehypertensive subjects completed the study. During four test sessions, participants first completed a graded exercise test to exhaustion and then performed 30 minutes of treadmill exercise at 7 am (7A), 1 pm (1P), and 7 pm (7P) in a random, counterbalanced order at 65\% of the heart rate obtained at peak oxygen uptake. An ambulatory cuff was used to monitor BP responses during 24 hours following exercise, and an ambulatory sleep-monitoring headband was worn during sleep following each session.

Results
Aerobic exercise at 7A invoked a greater dip in nocturnal systolic BP than exercise at 1P or 7P, although the greatest dip in nocturnal diastolic BP occurred following 7P. Compared to 1P, 7A also invoked greater time spent in deep sleep.

Conclusion
These data indicate that early morning may be the most beneficial time to engage in aerobic exercise to enhance nocturnal BP changes and quality of sleep.},

Eleven trained male cyclists (31.7 ± 5.9 y 82.3 ± 6.1 kg, VO2max = 60.3 ± 7.8 mL · kg-1 · min-1) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover-design study involving 3 experimental conditions. Participants were randomly administered Red Bull (9.4 mL/kg body mass [BM] containing 3 mg/kg BM caffeine), anhydrous caffeine (3 mg/kg BM given in capsule form), or a placebo 90 min before commencing a time trial equivalent to 1 h cycling at 75\% peak power output. Carbohydrate and fluid volumes were matched across all trials. Performance improved by 109 ± 153 s (2.8\%, P = .039) after Red Bull compared with placebo and by 120 ± 172 s (3.1\%, P = .043) after caffeine compared with placebo. No significant difference (P {\textgreater} .05) in performance time was detected between Red Bull and caffeine treatments. There was no significant difference (P {\textgreater} .05) in mean heart rate or rating of perceived exertion among the 3 treatments. This study demonstrated that a moderate dose of caffeine consumed as either Red Bull or in anhydrous form enhanced cycling time-trial performance. The ergogenic benefits of Red Bull energy drink are therefore most likely due to the effects of caffeine, with the other ingredients not likely to offer additional benefit.},

	abstract = {The cannabinoid CB(1) receptor-mediated modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release from inhibitory interneurons is important for the integrity of hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. Although adenosine A(1) receptors have a central role in fine-tuning excitatory transmission in the hippocampus, A(1) receptors localized in GABAergic cells do not directly influence GABA release. CB(1) and A(1) receptors are the main targets for the effects of two of the most heavily consumed psychoactive substances worldwide: Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, a CB(1) receptor agonist) and caffeine (an adenosine receptor antagonist). We first tested the hypothesis that an A(1)-CB(1) interaction influences GABA and glutamate release in the hippocampus. We found that A(1) receptor activation attenuated the CB(1)-mediated inhibition of GABA and glutamate release and this interaction was manifested at the level of G-protein activation. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we then investigated the functional implications of the adenosine-cannabinoid interplay that may arise following chronic caffeine consumption. Chronic administration of caffeine in mice (intraperitoneally, 3 mg/kg/day, for 15 days, {\textgreater}12 h before trials) led to an A(1)-mediated enhancement of the CB(1)-dependent acute disruptive effects of THC on a short-term spatial memory task, despite inducing a reduction in cortical and hippocampal CB(1) receptor number and an attenuation of CB(1) coupling with G protein. A(1) receptor levels were increased following chronic caffeine administration. This study shows that A(1) receptors exert a negative modulatory effect on CB(1)-mediated inhibition of GABA and glutamate release, and provides the first evidence of chronic caffeine-induced alterations on the cannabinoid system in the cortex and hippocampus, with functional implications in spatial memory.},

In the pineal gland, however, NAT activity shows circadian changes which respond to environmental lighting both in vivo and in vitro3,4. NAT is responsible for rhythmic production of the pineal hormone melatonin, which functions in body colour changes6, photoperiodic control of reproduction7,8, and behavioural circadian rhythms9,10. The rhythmic changes in NAT have so far been thought unique to the pineal gland. Here we report data for ocular NAT showing a change in a daily light–dark cycle and modification by environmental lighting. The finding of light modified NAT in the eye is significant because it may explain the failure of some investigators11 to find effects of pinealectomy and it may also explain the occurrence of rhythmic melatonin in the blood of some species after pinealectomy12–14. The prerequisites for the production of melatonin exist in the eye as well as in the pineal gland: serotonin15, hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activity16 and N-acetylindole17 are present. Furthermore, labelled serotonin is converted to melatonin by the retina in vitro18. Our finding of NAT and its modification by light and dark completes the argument for ocular capacity for melatonin production in a cyclic manner modified by environmental lighting.},

Results
During sleep, sleep architecture and alpha and delta power of EEG were similar in the two experimental conditions.

The analyses also revealed shifts among 1:2, 1:3, 2:3 and other modes of coupling of mood cycles to the two bi-weekly lunar cycles. These shifts appear to be responses to the conflicting demands of the mood cycles’ being entrained simultaneously to two different bi-weekly lunar cycles with slightly different periods. Measurements of circadian rhythms in body temperature suggest a biological mechanism through which transits of one of the moon’s semi-diurnal gravimetric tides might have driven the patients’ bipolar cycles, by periodically entraining the circadian pacemaker to its 24.84-h rhythm and altering the pacemaker’s phase-relationship to sleep in a manner that is known to cause switches from depression to mania.},

	abstract = {Also see www.JimHumble.biz, \&amp; Films at www.JimHUMBLE.com, 21 Protocols/Programs with MMS \&amp; MMS2, Iam not a Doctor Guy in Film is, also youtube VitoVerns Channel, Vito Cured His CANCER in 5 days, You half to take enought B/S with Molasses to keep PH 8+ for 5 days  Take 1-2 Sodium Bicarbonate tablets each day  thats Pure Baking Soda  each day cost is one penny day, this will give you Alkaline Body get PH Strips keep  around 7.3, of course if it gets to high back off take less ,Four  days ago a Young Lady Namedd Christy about 35 years old stoped and thanked me for telling Her about taking 1/4 PURE Baking Soda mixing  on medium Heat with 3/4 Pure Maple Syrup stir briskly, take One TABLE SPOONFUL while it is warm and with an Empty Stomack, take it 1 up to 6 times daily, Christy  said she started just over Three Months ago, 3 months ago Her Doctor wonted to take off one of Her Breast for Sure, 4 days ago she left his office Happy, He told Her Lady what ever Your doing keep it up Your Breast are looking Healthy

And Physically She looked and Acted more Energenic.

On the Internet I read about a North Carolina Dr that treated 200 Terminally ill patients with this method and they said he cured 185 of the 200, Plus He cured many of his regular Patients using this method, However it did say He had never treated a Cancer Patient with Bone Cancer so He did not know if it would work or not.on Bone Cancer.

The Article said the NC Dr. did this about 30 years ago

SCIENTIST Dr Hulda Clark would NOT treat a Cancer patient until they did the Liver and Gall Bladder Flush, I Just did 2 of 15 I will do. Dr Clark said after the 15  she said do one each year for Maintaince, see my UPLOADS, You can see the Green Stones I got out, our liver does over 900 functions to keep us Healthy.cost about \$5.00 for each flush, first time I used Lemon Juce second time Grape Fruit Juce, I think the Lemon Juice did a better job.

Also VERY CAREFULLY with the Chart I started take FOOD GRADE 35\% HYDROGEN PEROXIDE it add oxygen to our blood /Brain etc You start off with 3 drops twice day in 5 ounces of water gradually go up to 20 drops twice day for 5 weeks then gradually go down to 2 drops twice day, this is suppose to kill cancer and may diseases in our body, cost is \$20.oo for year supply

I Feel Better

I also mix 2 table spoons ful of Epson Salt this is Magnesium Sulfate to one Quart of Water, and drink 4-6 ounces at Bedtime and take TAURINE, cost of taurine \$2.50 month supply, Epson salt cost \$3.00 bag at wal-mart will proballly last a Year.

80 years ago they started leaving MAGnESIUM out of our Fertilizer, the land is starved so the Plants, vegetables, Fruit etc are starved. just YouTube MAGNESIUM, our blood sucks the Magnesium from our Cells \&amp; Bones so test will not tell if we need it or not, make no mistake about it we are 95\% deprived.

Farmers if they fail to put out Salt Blocks with Magnesium and a Cow grazes new grass at first frost it Kills the Cow, again Land is Depleted

Watch SCIENTIST Film on YouTube =georgeeby, Pause and Read the Charts, Understand what He is saying.


I think the Coffe Enemial at this site would be wise to also do Frequently, http://www.healingdaily.com/condition...,  

Avoid CANCER by having an ALKALINE body, take one to two Sodium Bicarbonate Tablets (its PURE BAKING SOdA)  each day, cost is about one penny each day, order 3 year supply over internet or buy at wal-mart pharmacy
If you come down with CANCER I think getting your PH level up to .9 for a Month will probally KILL the  CANCER, I think taking Baking Soda alone will do this, get the PH Strips you can piss on or the ones you can check your salavia with, Old North Carolina doctor mixed 1/4 baking soda \&amp; 3/4 pure maple syrup heat on med stir briskly take 1-6 Tablespoons each day, Normal Ph level is 7.4  to fight cancer again get it up to 9 for a month
Yandel Henderson said the same thing in 1930. Yandel invented the resuscitation trolley that is used in the hospital to this very day. He was also the first man to realize that pure oxygen alone is not the best way to re-start the breathing of a patient but a 7\% addition of carbon dioxide is best. When you see a cylinder of oxygen in an ambulance, remember Yandel because without him it wouldn't contain 7\% cO. Professor Otto Warburg also agreed that cancer was a fungal state of the cell in 193},

	volume = {61},
	issn = {0026-895X},
	abstract = {L-Acetylcarnitine (LAC, 100 mg/kg, s.c.), a drug commonly used for the treatment of painful neuropathies, substantially reduced mechanical allodynia in rats subjected to monolateral chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve and also attenuated acute thermal pain in intact rats. In both cases, induction of analgesia required repeated injections of LAC, suggesting that the drug induces plastic changes within the nociceptive pathway. In both CCI- and sham-operated rats, a 24-day treatment with LAC increased the expression of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors 2 and 3 in the lumbar segment of the spinal cord, without changing the expression of mGlu1a or -5 receptors. A similar up-regulation of mGlu2/3 receptors was detected in the dorsal horns and dorsal root ganglia of intact rats treated with LAC for 5-7 days, a time sufficient for the induction of thermal analgesia. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that LAC treatment enhanced mGlu2/3 immunoreactivity in the inner part of lamina II and in laminae III and IV of the spinal cord. An increased mGlu2/3 receptor expression was also observed in the cerebral cortex but not in the hippocampus or cerebellum of LAC-treated animals. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction combined with Northern blot analysis showed that repeated LAC injections selectively induced mGlu2 mRNA in the dorsal horns and cerebral cortex (but not in the hippocampus). mGlu3 mRNA levels did not change in any brain region of LAC-treated animals. To examine whether the selective up-regulation of mGlu2 receptors had any role in LAC-induced analgesia, we have used the novel compound LY 341495, which is a potent and systemically active mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist. LAC-induced analgesia was largely reduced 45 to 75 min after a single injection of LY 341495 (1 mg/kg, i.p.) in both CCI rats tested for mechanical allodynia and intact rats tested for thermal pain. We conclude that LAC produces analgesia against chronic pain produced not only by peripheral nerve injury but also by acute pain in intact animals and that LAC-induced analgesia is associated with and causally related to a selective up-regulation of mGlu2 receptors. This offers the first example of a selective induction of mGlu2 receptors and discloses a novel mechanism for drug-induced analgesia.},

	abstract = {Epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders and are unique potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The acetylating agent L-acetylcarnitine (LAC), a well-tolerated drug, behaves as an antidepressant by the epigenetic regulation of type 2 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu2) receptors. It caused a rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effect in Flinders Sensitive Line rats and in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable stress, which, respectively, model genetic and environmentally induced depression. In both models, LAC increased levels of acetylated H3K27 bound to the Grm2 promoter and also increased acetylation of NF-ĸB-p65 subunit, thereby enhancing the transcription of Grm2 gene encoding for the mGlu2 receptor in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Importantly, LAC reduced the immobility time in the forced swim test and increased sucrose preference as early as 3 d of treatment, whereas 14 d of treatment were needed for the antidepressant effect of chlorimipramine. Moreover, there was no tolerance to the action of LAC, and the antidepressant effect was still seen 2 wk after drug withdrawal. Conversely, NF-ĸB inhibition prevented the increase in mGlu2 expression induced by LAC, whereas the use of a histone deacetylase inhibitor supported the epigenetic control of mGlu2 expression. Finally, LAC had no effect on mGlu2 knockout mice exposed to chronic unpredictable stress, and a single injection of the mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist LY341495 partially blocked LAC action. The rapid and long-lasting antidepressant action of LAC strongly suggests a unique approach to examine the epigenetic hypothesis of depressive disorders in humans, paving the way for more efficient antidepressants with faster onset of action.},

Recently, we have become interested in physiological and subjective effects of daily exposure to essential oils. The primary aim of the present study was to clarify effects of olfactory stimulation with rose or orange oil on prefrontal cortex activity; subjective evaluations of relaxation were also determined.
SETTING AND INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were exposed for 90s to air impregnated with either rose or orange essential oil. As a control, subjects wore the same device but inhaled only unimpregnated air. The three stimuli were randomly presented to each subject.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physiological effects were determined by near-infrared time-resolved spectroscopy and a modified semantic differential approach was used to determine subjective evaluations.
RESULTS: The study participants were 20 female university students (mean age 22.5Â±1.6 years). Olfactory stimulation by rose or orange oil induced: (1) a significant decrease in oxyhemoglobin concentration in the right prefrontal cortex and (2) an increase in "comfortable," "relaxed," and "natural" feelings.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that olfactory stimulation by rose or orange oil induces physiological and psychological relaxation.},

Morphine dependence was induced by injection (IP) three times daily at doses of 50, 50 and 75 mg/kg, respectively, for 3 days. On day 4, after the last administration of morphine, Rosa damascena essential oil was administered at different concentrations (5, 2 and 40\%, IP) 30 min before administration of naloxone (5 mg/kg, IP). The following actions were taken as signs of withdrawal and records taken for jumping as a number and scores of 0 to 3 were given for incidences of grooming, teeth chattering, rearing, writing, diarrhea, wet dog shakes and climbing during a 30 min period. Results showed that different concentrations of Rosa damascena essential oil significantly reduced signs of morphine withdrawal compared to the control group in terms of number of jumps (p {\textless} 0.05 and p {\textless} 0.01), grooming, teeth chattering, rearing, climbing, wet dog shakes and writhing, but not for diarrhea (p {\textless} 0.05).

	abstract = {Introduction
Subjective memory complaints are common with aging. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n-3) is a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) and an integral part of neural membrane phospholipids that impacts brain structure and function. Past research demonstrates a positive association between DHA plasma status/dietary intake and cognitive function.

Objectives
The current meta-analysis was designed to determine the effect of DHA intake, alone or combined with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3), on specific memory domains: episodic, working, and semantic in healthy adults aged 18 years and older. A secondary objective was to systematically review/summarize the related observational epidemiologic literature.

Methods
A systematic literature search of clinical trials and observational studies that examined the relationship between n-3 LCPUFA on memory outcomes in healthy adults was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Studies of subjects free of neurologic disease at baseline, with or without mild memory complaints (MMC), were included. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to generate weighted group mean differences, standardized weighted group mean differences (Hedgeâ€™s g), z-scores, and p-values for heterogeneity comparing DHA/EPA to a placebo. A priori sub-group analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of age at enrollment, dose level, and memory type tested.

Results
Episodic memory outcomes of adults with MMC were significantly (P{\textless}.004) improved with DHA/EPA supplementation. Regardless of cognitive status at baseline, {\textgreater} 1 g/day DHA/EPA improved episodic memory (P{\textless}.04). Semantic and working memory changes from baseline were significant with DHA but no between group differences were detected. Observational studies support a beneficial association between intake/blood levels of DHA/EPA and memory function in older adults.

Conclusion
DHA, alone or combined with EPA, contributes to improved memory function in older adults with mild memory complaints.},

	abstract = {Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is the predominant omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) found in the brain and can affect neurological function by modulating signal transduction pathways, neurotransmission, neurogenesis, myelination, membrane receptor function, synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, membrane integrity and membrane organization. DHA is rapidly accumulated in the brain during gestation and early infancy, and the availability of DHA via transfer from maternal stores impacts the degree of DHA incorporation into neural tissues. The consumption of DHA leads to many positive physiological and behavioral effects, including those on cognition. Advanced cognitive function is uniquely human, and the optimal development and aging of cognitive abilities has profound impacts on quality of life, productivity, and advancement of society in general. However, the modern diet typically lacks appreciable amounts of DHA. Therefore, in modern populations, maintaining optimal levels of DHA in the brain throughout the lifespan likely requires obtaining preformed DHA via dietary or supplemental sources. In this review, we examine the role of DHA in optimal cognition during development, adulthood, and aging with a focus on human evidence and putative mechanisms of action.},

	abstract = {Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is important for brain function, and higher DHA intake is inversely correlated with relative risk of Alzheimer's disease. The potential benefits of DHA supplementation in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have not been fully examined. Our study aimed to determine the effect of DHA supplementation on cognitive function and hippocampal atrophy in elderly subjects with MCI. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Tianjin, China. 240 individuals with MCI aged 65 years and over were recruited and equalized randomly allocated to the DHA or the placebo group. Participants received 12-month DHA supplementation (2 g/day) or corn oil as placebo. Both global and specific subdomains of cognitive function and hippocampal volume were measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Both changes were analyzed by repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA). This trial has been registered: ChiCTR-IOR-15006058. A total of 219 participants (DHA: 110, Placebo: 109) completed the trial. The change in mean serum DHA levels was greater in the intervention group (+3.85\%) compared to the control group (+1.06\%). Repeated-measures analyses of covariance showed that, over 12 months, there was a significant difference in the Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (ηp2 = 0.084; p = 0.039), Information (ηp2 = 0.439; p = 0.000), and Digit Span (ηp2 = 0.375; p = 0.000) between DHA-treated versus the placebo group. In addition, there were significant differences in volumes of left hippocampus (ηp2 = 0.121, p = 0.016), right hippocampus (ηp2 = 0.757, p = 0.008), total hippocampus (ηp2 = 0.124, p = 0.023), and global cerebrum (ηp2 = 0.145, p = 0.032) between the two groups. These findings suggest that DHA supplementation (2 g/day) for 12 months in MCI subjects can significantly improve cognitive function and slow the progression of hippocampal atrophy. Larger, longer-term confirmatory studies are warranted.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.brainresbull.2006.01.009},
	abstract = {Neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus can be up- or downregulated in response to a variety of physiological and pathological conditions. Among these, dysregulation of hippocampal neurogenesis has been recently implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. In addition, in animal models of depression, a variety of antidepressant treatments reverse that condition by increasing neurogenesis. As one night sleep deprivation is known to improve mood in depressed patients for at least 1 day, we investigated whether a comparable treatment may affect hippocampal neurogenesis in adult rats. Accordingly, rats were sleep-deprived by gentle handling for 12 h during their physiological period of rest, and were injected with bromodeoxyuridine 4 h and 2 h before the end of sleep deprivation. They were then perfused immediately thereafter, or after 15 days and 30 days. We found that 12 h sleep deprivation significantly increased cell proliferation and the total number of surviving cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus soon after sleep deprivation, as well as 15 days and 30 days later, in comparison to control rats allowed to sleep. No changes were instead found in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles, indicating that 12 h sleep deprivation selectively triggers neurogenic signals to the hippocampus. The present data include acute sleep deprivation among the conditions which upregulate hippocampal neurogenesis and raise the possibility that such response could be implicated in the beneficial effects elicited in depressed patients by one night sleep deprivation. Thus, the findings could contribute to the understanding of the intriguing relationship between depression and neurogenesis in the adult brain.},

Yet, sparse research has examined temporal relationships between sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, and psychological factors implicated in suicide, such as entrapment. This is the first in-the-moment investigation of relationships between suicidal ideation, objective and subjective sleep parameters, and perceptions of entrapment.MethodsFifty-one participants with current suicidal ideation completed week-long ecological momentary assessments. An actigraph watch was worn for the duration of the study, which monitored total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and sleep latency. Daily sleep diaries captured subjective ratings of the same sleep parameters, with the addition of sleep quality. Suicidal ideation and entrapment were measured at six quasi-random time points each day. Multi-level random intercept models and moderation analyses were conducted to examine the links between sleep, entrapment, and suicidal ideation, adjusting for anxiety and depression severity.ResultsAnalyses revealed a unidirectional relationship whereby short sleep duration (both objective and subjective measures), and poor sleep quality, predicted the higher severity of next-day suicidal ideation. However, there was no significant association between daytime suicidal ideation and sleep the following night. Sleep quality moderated the relationship between pre-sleep entrapment and awakening levels of suicidal ideation.ConclusionsThis is the first study to report night-to-day relationships between sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, and entrapment. Findings suggest that sleep quality may alter the strength of the relationship between pre-sleep entrapment and awakening suicidal ideation. Clinically, results underscore the importance of assessing and treating sleep disturbance when working with those experiencing suicidal ideation.},

SHBG concentration rose from 38.1 +/- 18.3 to 54.3 +/- 16.0 nmol/l (P less than 0.01), while T and E2 showed significant increases from 31.2 +/- 10.8 nmol/l and 24.6 +/- 5.4 pg/ml to 52.0 +/- 3.6 and 43.3 +/- 14.9, respectively in the oligozoospermic patients, with similar rises noted in the normospermic men. FSH, LH and 17-OH-P were markedly elevated while on CC, but Prl and T4 remained unchanged. The findings of this study indicated the CC causes an increase of SHBG concentration, which is probably related to the rise of E2 concentration. This SHBG change, combined with the intrinsic oestrogenic activity of CC might be one of the factors responsible, through a decrease of free T and a T to E2 imbalance, for the lack of significant effect on parameters of seminal quality in so treated patients.},

	abstract = {A significant role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been previously implicated in the therapeutic effect of antidepressants. To ascertain the contribution of specific cell types in the brain that produce BDNF following antidepressant treatment, the effects of the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline on rat primary neuronal, astrocytic and microglial cortical cultures were examined. Amitriptyline increased the expression of BDNF mRNA in astrocytic and microglial cultures but not neuronal cultures. Antidepressants with distinct mechanisms of action, such as clomipramine, duloxetine and fluvoxamine, also increased BDNF mRNA expression in astrocytic and microglial cultures. There are multiple BDNF mRNA variants (exon I, IIA, IV and VI) expressed in astrocytes and microglia and the variant induced by antidepressants has yet to be elaborated. Treatment with antidepressants increased the expression of exon I, IV and VI in astrocyte and microglia. Clomipramine alone significantly upregulated expression of exon IIA. The amitriptyline-induced expression of both total and individual BDNF mRNA variants (exon I, IV and VI) were blocked by MEK inhibitor U0126, indicating MEK/ERK signaling is required in the expression of BDNF. These findings indicate that non-neural cells are a significant target of antidepressants and further support the contention that glial production of BDNF is crucial role in the therapeutic effect of antidepressants. The current data suggest that targeting of glial function could lead to the development of antidepressants with a truly novel mechanism of action.},

Fermented foods and beverages continue to make a significant contribution to the overall patterns of traditional dietary practices. As our knowledge of the human microbiome increases, including its connection to mental health (for example, anxiety and depression), it is becoming increasingly clear that there are untold connections between our resident microbes and many aspects of physiology. Of relevance to this research are new findings concerning the ways in which fermentation alters dietary items pre-consumption, and in turn, the ways in which fermentation-enriched chemicals (for example, lactoferrin, bioactive peptides) and newly formed phytochemicals (for example, unique flavonoids) may act upon our own intestinal microbiota profile. Here, we argue that the consumption of fermented foods may be particularly relevant to the emerging research linking traditional dietary practices and positive mental health. The extent to which traditional dietary items may mitigate inflammation and oxidative stress may be controlled, at least to some degree, by microbiota. It is our contention that properly controlled fermentation may often amplify the specific nutrient and phytochemical content of foods, the ultimate value of which may associated with mental health; furthermore, we also argue that the microbes (for example, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria species) associated with fermented foods may also influence brain health via direct and indirect pathways.},

	abstract = {TLR2 is a microbiota recognition receptor that has been described to contribute to intestinal homeostasis and to ameliorate inflammatory intestinal injury. In this context, serotonin (5-HT) has shown to be an essential intestinal physiological neuromodulator that is also involved in intestinal inflammatory diseases. Since the interaction between TLR2 activation and the intestinal serotoninergic system remains non-investigated, our main aim was to analyze the effect of TLR2 on intestinal serotonin transporter (SERT) activity and expression and the intracellular pathways involved. Caco-2/TC7 cells were used to analyze SERT and TLR2 molecular expression and SERT activity by measuring 5-HT uptake. The results showed that apical TLR2 activation inhibits SERT activity in Caco-2/TC7 cells mainly by reducing SERT protein level either in the plasma membrane, after short-term TLR2 activation or in both the plasma membrane and cell lysate, after long-term activation. cAMP/PKA pathway appears to mediate short-term inhibitory effect of TLR2 on SERT; however, p38 MAPK pathway has been shown to be involved in both short- and long-term TLR2 effect. Reciprocally, 5-HT long-term treatment yielded TLR2 down regulation in Caco-2/TC7 cells. Finally, results from in vivo showed an augmented intestinal SERT expression in mice Tlr2-/-, thus confirming our inhibitory effect of TLR2 on intestinal SERT in vitro. The present work infers that TLR2 may act in intestinal pathophysiology, not only by its inherent innate immune role, but also by regulating the intestinal serotoninergic system.},

The influence of TGF-β1 on serotonin transporter (SERT) activity, the critical mechanism regulating the extracellular availability of serotonin (5-HT), is not known. Current studies were designed to examine acute effects of TGF-β1 on SERT. Model human intestinal Caco-2 cells grown as monolayer’s or as cysts in 3D culture and ex vivo mouse model were utilized. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml, 60 min) stimulated SERT activity ({\textasciitilde}2 fold, P{\textless}0.005). This stimulation of SERT function was dependent upon activation of TGF-β1 receptor (TGFRI) as SB-431542, a specific TGF-βRI inhibitor blocked the SERT stimulation. SERT activation in response to TGF-β1 was attenuated by inhibition of PI3K and occurred via enhanced recruitment of SERT-GFP to apical surface in a PI3K dependent manner. The exocytosis inhibitor brefeldin A (2.5 μM) attenuated the TGF-β1-mediated increase in SERT function. TGF-β1 increased the association of SERT with the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) syntaxin 3 (STX3) and promoted exocytosis of SERT. Caco-2 cells grown as cysts in 3D culture recapitulated the effects of TGF-β1 showing increased luminal staining of SERT. Ussing chamber studies revealed increase in 3H-5-HT uptake in mouse ileum treated ex vivo with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml, 1h). These data demonstrate a novel mechanism rapidly regulating intestinal SERT via PI3K and STX3. Since decreased SERT is implicated in various gastro-intestinal disorders e.g IBD, IBS and diarrhea, understanding mechanisms stimulating SERT function by TGF-β1 offers a novel therapeutic strategy to treat GI disorders.},

	abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT) has been recognized for decades as an important signaling molecule in the gut, but it is still revealing its secrets. We continue to discover novel gastrointestinal (GI) functions of 5-HT, as well as actions of gut-derived 5-HT outside of the gut, and we are learning how 5-HT signaling is altered in GI disorders. Furthermore, new therapeutic targets related to 5-HT signaling are being identified that can hopefully be exploited to alleviate the symptoms of functional GI disorders. Conventional functions of 5-HT in the gut involving intrinsic reflexes include stimulation of propulsive and segmentation motility patterns, epithelial secretion, and vasodilation. Activation of extrinsic vagal and spinal afferent fibers results in slowed gastric emptying, pancreatic secretion, satiation, pain and discomfort, as well as nausea and vomiting. Within the gut, 5-HT also exerts non-conventional actions that include serving as a pro-inflammatory signaling molecule and as a trophic factor to promote the development and maintenance of neurons and interstitial cells of Cajal. Platelet 5-HT, which comes from the gut, can promote hemostasis, influence bone development, and contribute to allergic airway inflammation. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and 5-HT4 receptor agonists have been used to treat functional disorders with diarrhea or constipation, respectively. More recently, the synthetic enzyme, tryptophan hydroxylase has been targeted, and there are recent findings suggesting that epithelial 5-HT4 receptors could be targeted to provide a safe and effective treatment for constipation. Here we provide an overview of these serotonergic actions and treatment strategies.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Pharmacological manipulation of serotonergic neurotransmission in healthy volunteers impacts on cognitive test performance. Specifically, markers of serotonin function are associated with attention and executive functioning, long-term memory, and general cognitive ability. The serotonin transporter (SERT) protein is a key regulator in the serotonin system. We hypothesized that higher performance on tests sensitive to serotonin would be associated with higher SERT levels in specific fronto-striatal brain regions.
METHODS: Thirty-two healthy subjects (25 males, mean age 26.0 years, range 19-37) underwent positron emission tomography using the SERT ligand [(11)C]DASB. Subjects underwent the following tests: Stroop Color Word Test, Trail Making Test B, Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test and Complex Figure Test, logical reasoning subtest from Intelligenz-Struktur-Test 2000 R, and a Danish version of National Adult Reading Test.
RESULTS: We found positive associations between performance on the Stroop Color Word Test and right-sided dorsolateral prefrontal SERT binding (R(2) = 0.12, p = 0.048). Furthermore, scores of logical reasoning (correlating with IQ) and educational level associated positively with SERT binding in the caudate, most prominent on the left side (logical reasoning: R(2) = 0.34, p = 0.0026 (left), R(2) = 0.2, p = 0.022 (right), educational level: R(2) = 0.19, p = 0.012 (left), R(2) = 0.15, p = 0.027 (right)). Scores of logical reasoning also associated with left-sided ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (R(2) = 0.24, p = 0.014). There were no significant associations between SERT binding and tests of long-term episodic memory.
CONCLUSIONS: The results imply that in healthy subjects, high SERT binding in fronto-striatal regions is associated with better performance on tasks involving executive function and logical reasoning.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The primary approach in assessing the status of brain serotonin neurons in human conditions such as major depression and exposure to the illicit drug ecstasy has been the use of neuroimaging procedures involving radiotracers that bind to the serotonin transporter (SERT). However, there has been no consistency in the selection of a "SERT-free" reference region for the estimation of free and nonspecific binding, as occipital cortex, cerebellum and white matter have all been employed.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To identify areas of human brain that might have very low SERT levels, we measured, by a semiquantitative Western blotting procedure, SERT protein immunoreactivity throughout the postmortem brain of seven normal adult subjects.
RESULTS: Serotonin transporter could be quantitated in all examined brain areas. However, the SERT concentration in cerebellar cortex and white matter were only at trace values, being approximately 20\% of average cerebral cortex and 5\% of average striatum values.
CONCLUSION: Although none of the examined brain areas are completely free of SERT, human cerebellar cortex has low SERT binding as compared to other examined brain regions, with the exception of white matter. Since the cerebellar cortical SERT binding is not zero, this region will not be a suitable reference region for SERT radioligands with very low free and nonspecific binding. For SERT radioligands with reasonably high free and nonspecific binding, the cerebellar cortex should be a useful reference region, provided other necessary radioligand assumptions are met.},

This study investigated the gut microbiome in a South African sample of PTSD-affected individuals and trauma-exposed (TE) controls to identify potential differences in microbial diversity or microbial community structure.
METHODS: The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 was used to diagnose PTSD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria. Microbial DNA was extracted from stool samples obtained from 18 individuals with PTSD and 12 TE control participants. Bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene V3/V4 amplicons were generated and sequenced. Microbial community structure, α-diversity, and β-diversity were analyzed; random forest analysis was used to identify associations between bacterial taxa and PTSD.
RESULTS: There were no differences between PTSD and TE control groups in α- or β-diversity measures (e.g., α-diversity: Shannon index, t = 0.386, p = .70; β-diversity, on the basis of analysis of similarities: Bray-Curtis test statistic = -0.033, p = .70); however, random forest analysis highlighted three phyla as important to distinguish PTSD status: Actinobacteria, Lentisphaerae, and Verrucomicrobia. Decreased total abundance of these taxa was associated with higher Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores (r = -0.387, p = .035).
CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory study, measures of overall microbial diversity were similar among individuals with PTSD and TE controls; however, decreased total abundance of Actinobacteria, Lentisphaerae, and Verrucomicrobia was associated with PTSD status.},

Considering that enteric 5-HT is responsible for the secretion, motility and perception of the bowel, the involvement of altered enteric 5-HT metabolism in the pathogenesis of IBS has been elucidated. Higher 5-HT availability is commonly associated with depressed SERT mRNA in patients with IBS compared with healthy controls. The expression difference of SERT between IBS patients and healthy controls might suggest that SERT plays an essential role in IBS pathogenesis, and SERT was expected to be a novel therapeutic target for IBS. Progress in this area has begun to illuminate the complex regulatory mechanisms of SERT in the etiology of IBS. In this article, current insights regarding the regulation of SERT in IBS are provided, including aspects of SERT gene polymorphisms, microRNAs, immunity and inflammation, gut microbiota, growth factors, among others. Potential SERT-directed therapies for IBS are also described. The potential regulators of SERT are of clinical importance and are important for better understanding IBS pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies.},

NAD+ levels decline during the aging process and may be an Achillesâ€™ heel, causing defects in nuclear and mitochondrial functions and resulting in many age-associated pathologies. Restoring NAD+ by supplementing NAD+ intermediates can dramatically ameliorate these age-associated functional defects, counteracting many diseases of aging, including neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the combination of sirtuin activation and NAD+ intermediate supplementation may be an effective anti-aging intervention, providing hope to aging societies worldwide.},

However, the effects of creatine supplementation on cognitive processing and psychomotor performance in non-sleep deprived young adults have not been assessed with a comprehensive battery of neurocognitive tests. The primary objective of this study was to examine the effects of creatine supplementation on cognitive processing and psychomotor performance in young adults. Twenty-two subjects (21+/-2 yr) ingested creatine (0.03 g/kg/day) or placebo for 6 weeks in a double-blind placebo-controlled fashion. Subjects completed a battery of neurocognitive tests pre- and post-supplementation, including: simple reaction time (RT), code substitution (CS), code substitution delayed (CSD), logical reasoning symbolic (LRS), mathematical processing (MP), running memory (RM), and Sternberg memory recall (MR). There were no significant effects of group, no significant effects of time, and no significant group by time interactions for RT, CS, CSD, LRS, MP, RM, and MR (all p{\textgreater}0.05), indicating that there were no differences between creatine and placebo supplemented groups at any time. These results suggest that six weeks of creatine supplementation (0.03/g/kg/day) does not improve cognitive processing in non-sleep deprived young adults. Potentially, creatine supplementation only improves cognitive processing and psychomotor performance in individuals who have impaired cognitive processing abilities.},

	abstract = {AIM OF THE STUDY: To examine the effect of Bacopa monniera leaf ethanolic extract (BMEE) on the serotonergic system of postnatal rats with reference to learning and memory.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From postnatal day (PND)-15-29, rats were treated with BMEE (40 mg/kg BW+0.5\% gum acacia) by oral gavage. Behavioural tests (Y-maze, hole-board and passive avoidance) were used to evaluate their learning (PND-32-37) and retention of memory (PND-47-53). Effect of BMEE on neurotransmitter system was analyzed by ELISA and semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: Oral administration of BMEE improved learning and retention of memory significantly in all behavioural tasks. Following BMEE treatment, the level of serotonin (5-HT) increased while dopamine (DA) decreased significantly. We also found variation in the level of acetylcholine (ACh). However, no significant changes were observed in the level of ACh and glutamate (Glu). The level of 5-HT was significantly elevated up to PND-37 and was then restored to normal level on PND-53. Interestingly, concomitant up-regulation was recorded in the mRNA expression of serotonin synthesizing enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) and serotonin transporter (SERT) on PND-29 and PND-37, which was restored on PND-53.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that BMEE treatment significantly enhances the learning and retention of memory in postnatal rats possibly through regulating the expression of TPH2, 5-HT metabolism and transport.},

DESIGN: PubMed and CAB Abstracts databases were searched through July 1, 2008, with use of controlled vocabulary specific to the databases, such as soy, isoflavones, genistein, phytoestrogens, red clover, androgen, testosterone, and SHBG. Peer-reviewed studies published in English were selected if [1] adult men consumed soy foods, isolated soy protein, or isoflavone extracts (from soy or red clover) and [2] circulating T, SHBG, free T, or calculated FAI was assessed. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Isoflavone exposure was abstracted directly from studies.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Fifteen placebo-controlled treatment groups with baseline and ending measures were analyzed. In addition, 32 reports involving 36 treatment groups were assessed in simpler models to ascertain the results.
RESULT(S): No significant effects of soy protein or isoflavone intake on T, SHBG, free T, or FAI were detected regardless of statistical model.
CONCLUSION(S): The results of this meta-analysis suggest that neither soy foods nor isoflavone supplements alter measures of bioavailable T concentrations in men.},

	abstract = {Epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders and are unique potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The acetylating agent L-acetylcarnitine (LAC), a well-tolerated drug, behaves as an antidepressant by the epigenetic regulation of type 2 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu2) receptors. It caused a rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effect in Flinders Sensitive Line rats and in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable stress, which, respectively, model genetic and environmentally induced depression. In both models, LAC increased levels of acetylated H3K27 bound to the Grm2 promoter and also increased acetylation of NF-ĸB-p65 subunit, thereby enhancing the transcription of Grm2 gene encoding for the mGlu2 receptor in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Importantly, LAC reduced the immobility time in the forced swim test and increased sucrose preference as early as 3 d of treatment, whereas 14 d of treatment were needed for the antidepressant effect of chlorimipramine. Moreover, there was no tolerance to the action of LAC, and the antidepressant effect was still seen 2 wk after drug withdrawal. Conversely, NF-ĸB inhibition prevented the increase in mGlu2 expression induced by LAC, whereas the use of a histone deacetylase inhibitor supported the epigenetic control of mGlu2 expression. Finally, LAC had no effect on mGlu2 knockout mice exposed to chronic unpredictable stress, and a single injection of the mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist LY341495 partially blocked LAC action. The rapid and long-lasting antidepressant action of LAC strongly suggests a unique approach to examine the epigenetic hypothesis of depressive disorders in humans, paving the way for more efficient antidepressants with faster onset of action.},

Smoking during adolescence increases the risk of developing psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment in later life. In addition, adolescent smokers suffer from attention deficits, which aggravate with the years of smoking. Recent studies in rodents reveal the molecular changes induced by adolescent nicotine exposure that alter the functioning of synapses in the PFC and that underlie the lasting effects on cognitive function. Here we provide an overview of these recent findings., Nicotine exposure during adolescence alters acetylcholine and glutamate receptor signaling in the prefrontal cortex, one of the last brain areas to mature.

	abstract = {Urinary magnesium and pH are known to modulate urinary calcium excretion, but the mechanisms underlying these relationships are unknown. In this study, the data from 17 clinical trials in which urinary magnesium and pH were pharmacologically manipulated were analyzed, and it was found that the change in urinary calcium excretion is directly proportional to the change in magnesium excretion and inversely proportional to the change in urine pH; a regression equation was generated to relate these variables (R2 = 0.58). For further exploration of these relationships, intravenous calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, or vehicle was administered to rats. Magnesium infusion significantly increased urinary calcium excretion (normalized to urinary creatinine), but calcium infusion did not affect magnesium excretion. Parathyroidectomy did not prevent this magnesium-induced hypercalciuria. The effect of magnesium loading on calciuria was still observed after treatment with furosemide, which disrupts calcium and magnesium absorption in the thick ascending limb, suggesting that the effect may be mediated by the distal nephron. The calcium channel TRPV5, normally present in the distal tubule, was expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Calcium uptake by TRPV5 was directly inhibited by magnesium and low pH. In summary, these data are compatible with the hypothesis that urinary magnesium directly inhibits renal calcium absorption, which can be negated by high luminal pH, and that this regulation likely takes place in the distal tubule.},

Alcohol exposure can promote the growth of Gram negative bacteria in the intestine which may result in accumulation of endotoxin. In addition, alcohol metabolism by Gram negative bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells can result in accumulation of acetaldehyde, which in turn can increase intestinal permeability to endotoxin by increasing tyrosine phosphorylation of tight junction and adherens junction proteins. Alcohol-induced generation of nitric oxide may also contribute to increased permeability to endotoxin by reacting with tubulin, which may cause damage to microtubule cytoskeleton and subsequent disruption of intestinal barrier function. Increased intestinal permeability can lead to increased transfer of endotoxin from the intestine to the liver and general circulation where endotoxin may trigger inflammatory changes in the liver and other organs. Alcohol may also increase intestinal permeability to peptidoglycan which can initiate inflammatory response in liver and other organs. In addition, acute alcohol exposure may potentiate the effect of burn injury on intestinal bacterial growth and permeability. Decreasing the number of Gram negative bacteria in the intestine can result in decreased production of endotoxin as well as acetaldehyde which is expected to decrease intestinal permeability to endotoxin. In addition, intestinal permeability may be preserved by administering epidermal growth factor, L-glutamine, oats supplementation, or zinc thereby preventing the transfer of endotoxin to the general circulation. Thus reducing the number of intestinal Gram negative bacteria and preserving intestinal permeability to endotoxin may attenuate alcoholic liver and other organ injuries.},

Ethanol exposure moderately activates heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which was characterized by increased DNA-binding activity and phosphorylation status of HSF1. Remarkably, glutamine treatment enhanced ethanol-mediated expression of Hsp70 and activation of HSF1. Up-regulation of Hsp70 by pretreatment with heat stress also promoted recovery from the ethanol-induced barrier dysfunction.

Neither process has been thought to have relevance to mammalian physiology; however in recent years the salivary bacterial reduction of nitrate to nitrite has been recognized as an important metabolic conversion in humans. Several enteric bacteria have also shown the ability of catalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia via nitrite during dissimilatory respiration; however, the importance of this pathway in bacterial species colonizing the human intestine has been little studied. We measured nitrite, nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia formation in cultures of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species grown at different sodium nitrate concentrations and oxygen levels. We found that the presence of 5 mM nitrate provided a growth benefit and induced both nitrite and ammonia generation in E.coli and L.plantarum bacteria grown at oxygen concentrations compatible with the content in the gastrointestinal tract. Nitrite and ammonia accumulated in the growth medium when at least 2.5 mM nitrate was present. Time-course curves suggest that nitrate is first converted to nitrite and subsequently to ammonia. Strains of L.rhamnosus, L.acidophilus and B.longum infantis grown with nitrate produced minor changes in nitrite or ammonia levels in the cultures. However, when supplied with exogenous nitrite, NO gas was readily produced independently of added nitrate. Bacterial production of lactic acid causes medium acidification that in turn generates NO by non-enzymatic nitrite reduction. In contrast, nitrite was converted to NO by E.coli cultures even at neutral pH. We suggest that the bacterial nitrate reduction to ammonia, as well as the related NO formation in the gut, could be an important aspect of the overall mammalian nitrate/nitrite/NO metabolism and is yet another way in which the microbiome links diet and health.},

Historically, the literature has been dominated by studies on the formation of potentially carcinogenic nitrosamines, but the focus was shifted in the 1980s with the seminal discovery of the L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway and its profound impact on normal physiological functions. More recently, a nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway has been discovered, with implications for local host defence and gut mucosal integrity and, intriguingly, also for systemic regulation of cardiovascular and metabolic function.

Nitrite has long been identified as a stable intermediate of •NO oxidation but several lines of evidence support the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide in vivo. In the gut, this notion implies that nitrate from dietary sources fuels the longstanding production of nitrite in the oral cavity followed by univalent reduction to •NO in the stomach. Once formed, •NO boosts a network of reactions, including the production of higher nitrogen oxides that may have a physiological impact via the post-translational modification of proteins and lipids. Dietary compounds, such as polyphenols, and different prandial states (secreting specific gastric mediators) modulate the outcome of these reactions. The gut has unusual characteristics that modulate nitrite and •NO redox interplay: (1) wide range of pH (neutral vs acidic) and oxygen tension (c.a. 70 Torr in the stomach and nearly anoxic in the colon), (2) variable lumen content and (3) highly developed enteric nervous system (sensitive to •NO and dietary compounds, such as glutamate). The redox interplay of nitrite and •NO might also participate in the regulation of brain homeostasis upon neuronal glutamatergic stimulation in a process facilitated by ascorbate and a localized and transient decrease of oxygen tension. In a way reminiscent of that occurring in the stomach, a nitrite/•NO/ascorbate redox interplay in the brain at glutamatergic synapses, contributing to local •NO increase, may impact on •NO-mediated process., We here discuss the implications of the redox conversion of nitrite to •NO in the gut, how nitrite-derived •NO may signal from the digestive to the central nervous system, influencing brain function, as well as a putative ascorbate-driven nitrite/NO pathway occurring in the brain.,

	abstract = {Dietary polyphenols are complex, natural compounds with recognized health benefits. Initially attractive to the biomedical area due to their in vitro antioxidant properties, the biological implications of polyphenols are now known to be far from their acute ability to scavenge free radicals but rather to modulate redox signaling pathways. Actually, it is now recognized that dietary polyphenols are extensively metabolized in vivo and that the chemical, biophysical and biological properties of their metabolites are, in most cases, quite different from the ones of the parent molecules. Hence, the study of the metabolic, absorptive and signaling pathways of both phenolics and derivatives has become a major issue. In this paper we propose a short-cut for the systemic effects of polyphenols in connection with nitric oxide (˙NO) biology. This free radical is a ubiquitous signaling molecule with pivotal functions in vivo. It is produced through an enzymatic pathway and also through the reduction of dietary nitrate and nitrite in the human stomach. At acidic gastric pH, dietary polyphenols, in the form they are conveyed in foods and at high concentration, not only promote nitrite reduction to ˙NO but also embark in a complex network of chemical reactions to produce higher nitrogen oxides with signaling functions, namely by inducing post-translational modifications. Modified endogenous molecules, such as nitrated proteins and lipids, acquire important physiological functions. Thus, local and systemic effects of ˙NO such as modulation of vascular tone, mucus production in the gut and protection against ischemia–reperfusion injury are, in this sense, triggered by dietary polyphenols. Evidence to support the signaling and biological effects of polyphenols by modulation of the nitrate–nitrite–NO pathway will be herein provided and discussed. General actions of polyphenols encompassing absorption and metabolism in the intestine/liver are short-cut via the production of diffusible species in the stomach that have not only a local but also a general impact.},

Twelve participants completed a 15-day run-in period followed by a 15-day intervention with a daily intake of 3 g guaraná seed powder containing 90 mg (+)-catechin and 60 mg (−)-epicatechin. Blood samples were taken on the first and last day of the intervention period, fasting and 1 h post-dose. The administration of guaraná increased plasma ORAC, while reducing ex vivo LDL oxidation (only in the first study day) and hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage in lymphocytes, at 1 h post-dose. Plasma catechin (0.38 ± 0.12 and 0.44 ± 0.18 nmol mL−1), epicatechin (0.59 ± 0.18 and 0.64 ± 0.25 nmol mL−1) and their methylated metabolites were observed at 1 h post-dose but were almost negligible after overnight fasting. The activities of catalase (in both study days) and glutathione peroxidase (in the last intervention day) increased at 1 h post-dose. Furthermore, the activity of both enzymes remained higher than the basal levels in overnight-fasting individuals on the last intervention day, suggesting a prolonged effect of guaraná that continues even after plasma catechin clearance. In conclusion, guaraná catechins are bioavailable and contribute to reduce the oxidative stress of clinically healthy individuals, by direct antioxidant action of the absorbed phytochemicals and up-regulation of antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes.},

	abstract = {Objectives
An estimated 6\%–10\% of US adults took a hypnotic drug for poor sleep in 2010. This study extends previous reports associating hypnotics with excess mortality.

Setting
A large integrated health system in the USA.

Design
Longitudinal electronic medical records were extracted for a one-to-two matched cohort survival analysis.

Subjects
Subjects (mean age 54 years) were 10 529 patients who received hypnotic prescriptions and 23 676 matched controls with no hypnotic prescriptions, followed for an average of 2.5 years between January 2002 and January 2007.

Main outcome measures
Data were adjusted for age, gender, smoking, body mass index, ethnicity, marital status, alcohol use and prior cancer. Hazard ratios (HRs) for death were computed from Cox proportional hazards models controlled for risk factors and using up to 116 strata, which exactly matched cases and controls by 12 classes of comorbidity.

Results
As predicted, patients prescribed any hypnotic had substantially elevated hazards of dying compared to those prescribed no hypnotics. For groups prescribed 0.4–18, 18–132 and {\textgreater}132 doses/year, HRs (95\% CIs) were 3.60 (2.92 to 4.44), 4.43 (3.67 to 5.36) and 5.32 (4.50 to 6.30), respectively, demonstrating a dose–response association. HRs were elevated in separate analyses for several common hypnotics, including zolpidem, temazepam, eszopiclone, zaleplon, other benzodiazepines, barbiturates and sedative antihistamines. Hypnotic use in the upper third was associated with a significant elevation of incident cancer; HR=1.35 (95\% CI 1.18 to 1.55). Results were robust within groups suffering each comorbidity, indicating that the death and cancer hazards associated with hypnotic drugs were not attributable to pre-existing disease.

Conclusions
Receiving hypnotic prescriptions was associated with greater than threefold increased hazards of death even when prescribed {\textless}18 pills/year. This association held in separate analyses for several commonly used hypnotics and for newer shorter-acting drugs. Control of selective prescription of hypnotics for patients in poor health did not explain the observed excess mortality.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that people taking anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs are at increased risk of premature mortality, using primary care prescription records and after adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: 273 UK primary care practices contributing data to the General Practice Research Database.
PARTICIPANTS: 34,727 patients aged 16 years and older first prescribed anxiolytic or hypnotic drugs, or both, between 1998 and 2001, and 69,418 patients with no prescriptions for such drugs (controls) matched by age, sex, and practice. Patients were followed-up for a mean of 7.6 years (range 0.1-13.4 years).
MAIN OUTCOME: All cause mortality ascertained from practice records.
RESULTS: Physical and psychiatric comorbidities and prescribing of non-study drugs were significantly more prevalent among those prescribed study drugs than among controls. The age adjusted hazard ratio for mortality during the whole follow-up period for use of any study drug in the first year after recruitment was 3.46 (95\% confidence interval 3.34 to 3.59) and 3.32 (3.19 to 3.45) after adjusting for other potential confounders. Dose-response associations were found for all three classes of study drugs (benzodiazepines, Z drugs (zaleplon, zolpidem, and zopiclone), and other drugs). After excluding deaths in the first year, there were approximately four excess deaths linked to drug use per 100 people followed for an average of 7.6 years after their first prescription.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of patients attending UK primary care, anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs were associated with significantly increased risk of mortality over a seven year period, after adjusting for a range of potential confounders. As with all observational findings, however, these results are prone to bias arising from unmeasured and residual confounding.},

The nootropic affects the brain performances through number of mechanisms or pathways, for example, dopaminergic pathway. Previous researches have reported the influence of nootropics on treating memory disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Those disorders are observed to impair the same pathways of the nootropics. Thus, recent established nootropics are designed sensitively and effectively towards the pathways. Natural nootropics such as Ginkgo biloba have been widely studied to support the beneficial effects of the compounds.

	abstract = {Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by pulmonary arterial remodeling mainly due to excess cellular proliferation and apoptosis resistance of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Salidroside, an active ingredient isolated from Rhodiola rosea is proposed to exert protective effects against PAH. However, the function of salidroside in PAH has not been investigated systematically and the underlying mechanisms are not clear. To investigate the effects of salidroside on PAH, the mice in chronic hypoxia model of PAH were given by an increasing concentration of salidroside (0, 16 mg/kg, 32 mg/kg, and 64 mg/kg). After salidroside treatment, the chronic hypoxia-induced right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary arterial remodeling were attenuated, suggesting a protective role played by salidroside in PAH. To explore the potential mechanisms, the apoptosis of PASMCs after salidroside treatment under hypoxia conditions were determined in vivo and in vitro, and also the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis factors, Bax, Bcl-2, cytochrome C, and caspase 9 were examined. The results revealed that salidroside reversed hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis resistance at least partially via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. In addition, salidroside upregulated the expression of adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR) in lung tissues of mice and in PASMCs in vitro after hypoxia exposure. Combined the evidence above, we conclude that salidroside can attenuate chronic hypoxia-induced PAH by promoting PASMCs apoptosis via an A2aR related mitochondria dependent pathway.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Menopausal women are challenged by the adverse effects of estrogen loss on energy, mood, cognitive function, and memory. These stresses are compounded by increased risks for cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and cancer. Known to have neuroprotective, cardio-protective, anti-oxidative and anti-carcinogenic effects, Rhodiola rosea extracts have also been shown to improve energy, mood, cognitive function and memory.
PURPOSE: We propose that R. rosea be investigated for use as a potential selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) in the prevention and treatment of menopause-related fatigue, stress, depression, cognitive decline, memory impairment, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and cancer.
METHOD: This paper briefly reviews the relationship between estrogen decline and menopause-related health risks, the molecular mechanisms underlying estrogenic effects on health, and the evidence indicating beneficial effects of R. rosea extracts on these mechanisms and health risks. Mechanisms include non-genomic and genomic effects, for example: activation of intra-cellular signal transduction pathways by binding to estrogen receptors, ERα-mediated activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase with increased nitric oxide release; and anti-inflammatory effects, counteracting TNFα by inhibiting nuclear factor-Kappa-B (NF-KB) and protection of osteoblasts from hydrogen peroxide. A clinical case illustrating treatment of a menopausal woman with R. rosea is presented. Risks, benefits, gaps in knowledge, and future directions are discussed.
CONCLUSION: Numerous lines of evidence indicate that R. rosea should be investigated as a potential selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) to prevent, delay or mitigate menopause-related cognitive, psychological, cardiovascular and osteoporotic conditions.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The older antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have a variety of effects on sleep, including marked reduction in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and sleep latency, and an increase in light sleep. The effects of the newer AEDs on sleep are unknown. Our purpose was to study the effect of gabapentin (GBP) on sleep.
METHODS: Ten healthy adults and nine controls were the subjects of this study. All underwent baseline and follow-up polysomnography (PSG) and completed sleep questionnaires. After baseline, the treated group received GBP titrated to 1,800 mg daily. Polygraphic variables and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores, a subjective measure of sleep propensity, were compared by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
RESULTS: Nine of the treated subjects achieved the target dose; one was studied with 1,500 mg daily because of dizziness experienced at the higher dose. GBP-treated subjects had an increase in SWS compared with baseline. No difference in the ESS or other polygraphic variables was observed. However, a minor reduction in arousals, awakenings, and stage shifts was observed in treated subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: GBP appears to be less disruptive to sleep than are some of the older AEDs. These findings may underlie the drug's therapeutic effect in the treatment of disorders associated with sleep disruption.},

	doi = {10.1097/WNF.0b013e3181cda242},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of insomnia is very high in our society. Although pharmacological treatment of insomnia is available, most hypnotics have been shown to alter sleep architecture and have many adverse effects. Gabapentin was originally designed for antiepileptic therapy; however, some studies reported that its use increases slow-wave sleep in healthy volunteers or patients. Our goal was to evaluate the benefits of gabapentin in the treatment of primary insomnia in patients.
METHODS: Eighteen patients with primary insomnia participated in the study. They received gabapentin treatment for at least 4 weeks. All patients received polysomnography, a biochemical blood test, and neuropsychological tests before and after the treatment period. All measures were analyzed with Student t test to examine the treatment effects of gabapentin, except that the measures of heart rate variability were analyzed with analysis of variance.
RESULTS: Polysomnographic study revealed increased sleep efficiency and slow-wave sleep, decreased wake after sleep onset, and spontaneous arousal index after gabapentin treatment. The biochemical blood test revealed decreased prolactin levels in the morning after treatment. Electroencephalographic power spectral analysis showed increased delta-2 and theta power in sleep stage 1 and decreased sigma activity power in sleep stages N2 and N3 after gabapentin treatment. Heart rate variability analyses also showed a significant increase in normalized high frequency percentage in sleep stages N2 and N3 and low frequency-high frequency ratio in sleep stage N2 after treatment. In addition, neuropsychological tests revealed the elevation of visual motor processing speed after gabapentin treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin enhances slow-wave sleep in patients with primary insomnia. It also improves sleep quality by elevating sleep efficiency and decreasing spontaneous arousal. The results suggest that gabapentin may be beneficial in the treatment of primary insomnia.},

Axons, dendrites, presynapses, and postsynapses were visualized by immunostaining for phosphorylated neurofilament-H (NF-H), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), synaptophysin, and postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), respectively.
            
            
              Treatment with Aβ(25–35) (10 μM) induced axonal and dendritic atrophy, and pre- and postsynaptic loss in cultured rat cortical neurons. Subsequent treatment with WL-A (1 μM) induced significant regeneration of both axons and dendrites, in addition to the reconstruction of pre- and postsynapses in the neurons.
            
            
              WL-A (10 μmol kg−1 day−1, for 13 days, p.o.) recovered Aβ(25–35)-induced memory deficit in mice. At that time, the decline of axons, dendrites, and synapses in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus was almost recovered.
            
            
              WL-A is therefore an important candidate for the therapeutic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, as it is able to reconstruct neuronal networks.},

	abstract = {As the elderly population grows the impact of age associated cognitive decline as well as neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia will increase. Ageing is associated with consistent impairments in cognitive processes (e.g., processing speed, memory, executive function and learning) important for work, well-being, life satisfaction and overall participation in society. Recently, there has been increased effort to conduct research examining methods to improve cognitive function in older citizens. Cognitive training has been shown to improve performance in some cognitive domains; including memory, processing speed, executive function and attention in older adults. These cognitive changes are thought to be related to improvements in brain connectivity and neural circuitry. Bacopa monnieri has also been shown to improve specific domains of cognition, sensitive to age associated cognitive decline (particularly processing speed and memory). These Bacopa monnieri dependent improvements may be due to the increase in specific neuro-molecular mechanisms implicated in the enhancement of neural connections in the brain (i.e. synaptogenesis). In particular, a number of animal studies have shown Bacopa monnieri consumption upregulates calcium dependent kinases in the synapse and post-synaptic cell, crucial for strengthening and growing connections between neurons. These effects have been shown to occur in areas important for cognitive processes, such as the hippocampus. As Bacopa monnieri has shown neuro-molecular mechanisms that encourage synaptogenesis, while cognitive training enhances brain connectivity, Bacopa monnieri supplementation could theoretically enhance and strengthen synaptic changes acquired through cognitive training. Therefore, the current paper hypothesises that the combination of these two interventions could improve cognitive outcomes, over and above the effects of administrating these interventions independently, as an effective treatment to ameliorate age associated cognitive decline.},

The aim was to explore the possible use of this mushroom in nerve repair. The activities of aqueous extract were compared to activities exhibited by mecobalamin (vitamin B12), which has been widely used in the treatment of peripheral nerve disorders. Analysis of walking track indicated that return of hind limb function and normal toe spreading occurred earlier in treated groups than in the negative control (non-treated) group. Regeneration of axons and reinnervation of motor endplates/neuromuscular junction in extensor digitorum longus muscle of rats in treated groups developed better than in the negative control group. Further, immunofluorescence studies also showed that dorsal root ganglia neurons ipsilateral to the crush injury in rats of treated groups expressed higher immunoreactivities for Akt and MAPK signaling pathways as well as c-Jun and c-Fos genes compared to the negative control group. Akt cascade plays a major role in mediating neurotrophin-promoted cell survival, while MAPK cascade is involved in mediating neurite outgrowth. Immediate early gene expression was also involved in the cascade of events leading to regeneration. Local axonal protein synthetic machinery was also enhanced in the distal segments of crushed nerves in treated groups. Therefore, daily oral administration of H. erinaceus could promote the regeneration of injured rat peroneal nerve in the early stage of recovery.},

In this study, we evaluated the synergistic interaction between H. erinaceus aqueous extract and exogenous NGF on the neurite outgrowth stimulation of neuroblastoma-glioma cell NG108-15. The neuroprotective effect of the mushroom extract toward oxidative stress was also studied. Aqueous extract of H. erinaceus was shown to be non-cytotoxic to human lung fibroblast MRC-5 and NG108-15 cells. The combination of 10 ng/mL NGF with 1 Î¼g/mL mushroom extract yielded the highest percentage increase of 60.6\% neurite outgrowth. The extract contained neuroactive compounds that induced the secretion of extracellular NGF in NG108-15 cells, thereby promoting neurite outgrowth activity. However, the H. erinaceus extract failed to protect NG108-15 cells subjected to oxidative stress when applied in pre-treatment and co-treatment modes. In conclusion, the aqueous extract of H. erinaceus contained neuroactive compounds which induced NGF-synthesis and promoted neurite outgrowth in NG108-15 cells.

We discovered a novel bioactivity of H. erinaceus in its ability to suppress adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-induced calcium signaling in neuronal PC12 cells. ATP, known primarily as a neurotransmitter, also acts on purinoceptors (P2 purinergic receptor [P2R]) to generate the cellular calcium signaling and secretion that mediate P2R physiological manifestations, including pain. Chronic pain reduces quality of life. However, constant analgesic administration can cause liver and kidney injury, as well as loss of the analgesic effect because of desensitization. In this study we investigated the analgesic potential of H. erinaceus through measurements of ATP-induced Ca2+ signaling in cell lines and observation of pain behaviors in mice. In P2R-coupled Ca2+ signaling measurements, extracts of H. erinaceus mycelia (HEEs) blocked ATP-induced Ca2+ signaling in both rat PC12 cells and human HOS cells. HEEs completely blocked ATP-induced Ca2+ signaling in human HOS cells, suggesting that this effect of HEEs is exerted through the P2R subtypes present in HOS cells, which include the P2X4, P2X7, P2Y2, and P2Y4 subtypes. In observations of animal behavior during pain, HEEs significantly reduced heat-induced pain, including postponing both the tail-flick response to heat stimulation and the paw-lifting response to a hot plate. This study demonstrates novel characteristics of H. erinaceus in reducing nociceptive behavior and blocking the functional activity of P2R. Further studies are required to verify this linkage and its molecular mechanisms.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the antimetastatic activity of four Hericium erinaceus edible mushroom extracts using CT-26 murine colon carcinoma cells as an indicator of inhibition of cell migration to the lung. Hot water (HWE) and microwaved 50\% ethanol (MWE) extracts of H. erinaceus strongly elicited cancer cell death through apoptosis and inhibited metastasis of cancer cells to the lungs by 66\% and 69\%, respectively. HWE and MWE reduced the expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 in cells and their activities in culture media. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), another extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading proteinase, also showed decreased protein expression. In CT-26 cells, HWE and MWE down-regulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylations. The reduced phosphorylations seem to cause reduction of activity of the MMPs, thereby blocking migration and invasion of cells. Dietary administration of HWE and MWE reduced the formation of tumor nodules in the lung by about 50\% and 55\%, respectively, and prevented increases in lung weight caused by cancer cell metastasis. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of HWE and MWE as beneficial antimetastatic agents, targeting their upstream signaling molecules for mediating the expression of the ECM-degrading proteinases. Acidic and alkaline extracts were not bioactive. Bioactivity seems to be related to composition. H. erinaceus edible mushrooms have the potential to serve as a health-promoting functional food.},

	abstract = {Hericium erinaceus, an edible and medicinal mushroom, displays various pharmacological activities in the prevention of dementia in conditions such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. The present study explored the neuroprotective effects of H. erinaceus mycelium polysaccharide-enriched aqueous extract (HE) on an l-glutamic acid (l-Glu)-induced differentiated PC12 (DPC12) cellular apoptosis model and an AlCl3 combined with d-galactose-induced Alzheimer’s disease mouse model. The data revealed that HE successfully induced PC12 cell differentiation. A 3 h HE incubation at doses of 50 and 100 µg/mL before 25 mM of l-Glu effectively reversed the reduction of cell viability and the enhancement of the nuclear apoptosis rate in DPC12 cells. Compared with l-Glu-damaged cells, in PC12 cells, HE suppressed intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, blocked Ca2+ overload and prevented mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization. In the Alzheimer’s disease mouse model, HE administration enhanced the horizontal and vertical movements in the autonomic activity test, improved the endurance time in the rotarod test, and decreased the escape latency time in the water maze test. It also improved the central cholinergic system function in the Alzheimer’s mice, demonstrated by the fact that it dose-dependently enhanced the acetylcholine (Ach) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) concentrations in both the serum and the hypothalamus. Our findings provide experimental evidence that HE may provide neuroprotective candidates for treating or preventing neurodegenerative diseases.},

Especially hericenones and erinacines isolated from its fruiting body stimulate nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis, which expects H. erinaceus to have some effects on brain functions and autonomic nervous system. Herein, we investigated the clinical effects of H. erinaceus on menopause, depression, sleep quality and indefinite complaints, using the Kupperman Menopausal Index (KMI), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Indefinite Complaints Index (ICI). Thirty females were randomly assigned to either the H. erinaceus (HE) group or the placebo group and took HE cookies or placebo cookies for 4 weeks. Each of the CES-D and the ICI score after the HE intake was significantly lower than that before. In two terms of the ICI, "insentive" and "palpitatio", each of the mean score of the HE group was significantly lower than the placebo group. "Concentration", "irritating" and "anxious" tended to be lower than the placebo group. Our results show that HE intake has the possibility to reduce depression and anxiety and these results suggest a different mechanism from NGF-enhancing action of H. erinaceus.},

	abstract = {Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) constitutes a large portion of the brain and nervous tissue and is necessary for cognitive function and development. Evidence suggests that supplementation with omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids may improve cognitive performance and be protective against cognitive decline. However, the changes in brain phospholipid fatty acid composition after supplementation with n-3 fatty acids are poorly described. The objective of this study was to 1) investigate how increasing dietary eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)+DHA influences brain fatty acid composition, and 2) determine if the red blood cell (RBC), as a biomarker, reflects dietary induced fatty acid changes in the brain. Mice were fed fish oil with increasing EPA+DHA concentrations, equivalent to recommendations by the American Heart Association on a percent of energy (\%en) basis (0.1\%, 0.675\%, and 1.8\% of total energy from EPA+DHA in the diet). Whole brain and blood samples were collected, phospholipids were isolated, and fatty acid methyl esters were quantified using gas chromatography. Brain, RBC, and plasma fatty acid levels were reported as a \% of total fatty acids, and the changes in phospholipid fatty acid composition of the brain were investigated in relation to RBCs and plasma. Increasing dietary supplementation of fish oil enriched with EPA+DHA did not alter brain DHA, where mean \% of total remained at 17\% of the total fatty acid composition and only fluctuated by Â± 0.3\% between the control mice and the mice fed the 1.8\%en EPA+DHA diet. However, brain EPA significantly increased from 0.02\% to 0.10\% and total n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly decreased from 12.5\% to 8.1\% when comparing the control mice and highest dietary treatment group, respectively. These changes in EPA and total n-6 fatty acids in the brain were correlated with changes in the RBC and plasma phospholipid compositions (r {\textgreater} 0.8). In addition, brain cis-monounsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids oleic, eicosenoic, and nervonic acid (p {\textless} 0.0001) and saturated fatty acids arachidic, behenic, and lignoceric acid (p {\textless} 0.05) increased with increasing dietary EPA+DHA. Delta-5-desaturase enzyme activity estimates (EAEs) significantly increased and stearoyl-CoA desaturase n-7 EAEs significantly decreased across treatment groups in the brain, suggesting fatty acid metabolism in the brain may be altered with increasing dietary EPA+DHA. In conclusion, increasing dietary EPA+DHA did not alter DHA in the brain, but did significantly change brain EPA, MUFA, and long chain saturated fatty acid levels in phospholipids. Since changes in these fatty acids levels in the brain are not well described, further research should investigate how increasing the intake of DHA and EPA may affect cognition and neurodegenerative disease.},

In this study, wedevelop criteria to establish whether an L2 speaker has achieved native-likeproficiency.

METHODS: This article summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the clinical efficacy and safety of WS(®) 5570.
RESULTS: In randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials the antidepressant effect of the drug was superior to that of the placebo and at least comparable to that of paroxetine. The beneficial effect of WS(®) 5570 is particularly pronounced with respect to the core symptoms of depression. There is evidence that the drug may also be effective in moderate to severe depression and in prophylactic continuation treatment after recovery from an acute episode.
CONCLUSIONS: WS(®) 5570 has a very favourable safety profile, with adverse event rates on one level with placebo and lower than that of synthetic antidepressants in randomised, controlled clinical trials. It may therefore also be an option for patients who do not tolerate other antidepressant drugs. Patients with polydrug treatment should nevertheless use the drug with caution, due to its potential for interactions.},

Here, we present a subgroup analysis of a double blind, randomised trial to compare the therapeutic efficacy of WS(®) 5570 with paroxetine in patients suffering from a major depressive episode with moderate symptom intensity.
METHODS: moderate depression was defined by a baseline Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score between 22 and 25. Patients received, after a single blind placebo run-in phase of 3-7 d, either 3 × 300 mg/d WS(®) 5570 or 20 mg/d paroxetine for six weeks. The change of the HAM-D total score was used to describe the efficacy of WS(®) 5570 compared with paroxetine in the subgroup of patients with moderate depression.
RESULTS: the reductions of the HAM-D total score were significantly more pronounced in patients treated with 3 × 300 mg/d WS(®) 5570 compared to 20 mg/d paroxetine.

In addition, there is evidence for differences in sensitivity to the abuse-related effects of psychostimulants across the menstrual cycle which may result from effects of ovarian hormones on DA function. The goal of the present study was to extend previous work examining menstrual cycle-related changes in DA D2 receptor availability in humans to drug-naive female cynomolgus monkeys (n=7) using the selective D2-like receptor ligand [(18)F]fluoroclebopride (FCP) and a high-resolution microPET P4 scanner. Menstrual cycle phase was characterized by daily vaginal swabs and measurements of serum progesterone levels. PET studies were conducted once during the luteal phase and once during the follicular phase. Regions of interest in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and cerebellum were defined on coregistered MRIs. Distribution volumes were calculated for FCP in each structure and the distribution volume ratio (DVR) for both brain regions relative to the cerebellum was used as a measure of D2 receptor availability. FCP DVRs were significantly higher in the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase in both the caudate nucleus (11.7\% difference, p=0.02) and putamen (11.6\% difference, p=0.03). These findings extend earlier work in humans and suggest that changes in DA receptor availability may be involved in the variation in symptoms of various neuropsychiatric disorders across the menstrual cycle, including differences in sensitivity to the abuse-related effects of stimulants.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to elucidate the effect of estrogen on dopaminergic and serotonergic regulation of prepulse inhibition (PPI) by measuring its effects on the density of dopamine transporters (DAT), dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors, serotonin transporters (SERT), serotonin-1A (5-HT(1A)) and 5-HT(2A) receptors using radioligand binding autoradiography. Three groups of female Sprague-Dawley rats were compared: sham-operated controls, untreated ovariectomized (OVX) rats and OVX rats with a 17beta-estradiol implant (OVX+E). These groups were identical to our previous prepulse inhibition (PPI) studies, allowing comparison of the results. Results showed that in the nucleus accumbens, DAT levels were 44\% lower in OVX rats than in intact controls. Estrogen treatment completely reversed the effect of OVX in this brain region to levels similar to those in intact controls. Dopamine D(2) receptor density was increased in OVX rats by 28\% in the nucleus accumbens and 25\% in the caudate nucleus compared to intact controls. Estrogen treatment reversed this increase and, in addition, reduced dopamine D(2) receptor levels by a further 25\% and 20\%, respectively, compared to intact control rats. There were no differences between the groups with respect to the densities of dopamine D(1) receptors, SERT, 5-HT(1A) receptors or 5-HT(2A) receptors. These results show effects of estrogen treatment on central indices of dopaminergic, but not serotonergic function. The observed changes do not provide a direct overlap with the effects of these estrogen treatment protocols on drug-induced disruptions of PPI, but it is possible that a combination of effects, i.e. on both DAT and dopamine D(2) receptor density, is involved. These data could also be relevant for our understanding of the potential protective effect of estrogen treatment in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 3 months of estrogen replacement therapy, estrogen plus progesterone replacement therapy and a placebo, on the resting cortisol and interleukin-6(IL-6) levels in post-menopausal women.

Methods
Forty three women were randomised to one of three treatment arms: estradiol 2 mg/day (ERT), estradiol 2 mg/day plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 5 mg/day (HRT), or a placebo that was administered orally for 3 months.

Results
Cortisol levels showed a significant condition by intervention interaction. Post-hoc tests showed that ERT significantly increased cortisol levels after treatment compared to baseline, while in the HRT group a trend toward increased cortisol was found. No changes were observed in IL-6 levels.

Conclusions
Estrogen administration elevated cortisol levels, but this effect may be moderated by progestins. IL-6 was not altered by ERT or HRT, future studies should consider the interaction of cortisol increases on change in IL-6 expression.},

AI-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS) occur in approximately half of treated women, and lead to treatment discontinuation in 20â€“30\%. The etiology may be due in part to estrogen deprivation. In premenopausal women, lower estrogen levels have been associated with increased pain, as well as with impairment of descending pain inhibitory pathways, which may be a risk factor for developing chronic pain. We prospectively tested whether AI-induced estrogen deprivation alters pain sensitivity, thereby increasing the risk of developing AIMSS. Fifty postmenopausal breast cancer patients underwent pressure pain testing and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) assessment prior to AI initiation and after 3 and 6 months. At baseline, 26 of 40 (65\%) assessed patients demonstrated impaired CPM, which was greater in those who had previously received chemotherapy (p=0.006). No statistically significant change in pressure pain threshold or CPM was identified following estrogen deprivation. In addition, there was no association with either measure of pain sensitivity and change in patient-reported pain with AI therapy. AIMSS are not likely due to decreased pain threshold or impaired CPM prior to treatment initiation, or to effects of estrogen depletion on pain sensitivity. Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01814397.},

	abstract = {Resveratrol is a plant polyphenol capable of exerting beneficial metabolic effects which are thought to be mediated in large by the activation of the NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1. Although resveratrol has been claimed to be a bona fide SIRT1 activator using a peptide substrate (Fluor de Lys-SIRT1 peptide substrate), recent reports indicate that this finding might be an experimental artifact and need to be clarified. Here, we show that: (i) the Fluor de Lys-SIRT1 peptide is an artificial SIRT1 substrate because in the absence of the covalently linked fluorophore the peptide itself is not a substrate of the enzyme, (ii) resveratrol does not activate SIRT1 in vitro in the presence of either a p53-derived peptide substrate or acetylated PGC-1alpha isolated from cells, and (iii) although SIRT1 deacetylates PGC-1alpha in both in vitro and cell-based assays, resveratrol did not activate SIRT1 under these conditions. Based on these observations, we conclude that the pharmacological effects of resveratrol in various models are unlikely to be mediated by a direct enhancement of the catalytic activity of the SIRT1 enzyme. In consequence, our data challenge the overall utility of resveratrol as a pharmacological tool to directly activate SIRT1.},

In addition, rimonabant administered alone elevates DNMS performance, presumably through the suppression of negative modulation by released endocannabinoids during normal task performance. Other investigations have shown that rimonabant enhances encoding of DNMS task-relevant information on a trial-by-trial, delay-dependent basis. In this study, these reciprocal pharmacological actions were completely characterized by long-term, chronic intrahippocampal infusion of both agents (WIN and rimonabant) in successive 2-week intervals. Such long-term exposure allowed extraction and confirmation of task-related firing patterns, in which rimonabant reversed the effects of CB1 agonists. This information was then utilized to artificially impose the facilitatory effects of rimonabant and to reverse the effects of WIN on DNMS performance, by delivering multichannel electrical stimulation in the same firing patterns to the same hippocampal regions. Direct comparison of normal and WIN-injected subjects, in which rimonabant injections and ensemble firing facilitated performance, verified reversal of the modulation of hippocampal memory processes by CB1 receptor agonists, including released endocannabinoids.},

Present data showed a significant and stable weight loss both in animals treated with rimonabant 10mg/kg by oral gavage exposed to a high fat diet (SRFD) and in vehicle treated mice switched to a regular chow (VEND) with respect to vehicle fat diet fed mice (VEFD). Caloric intake was significantly lowered in SRFD and VEND during the first two and four days, respectively, then reaching the VEFD consume throughout the treatment. The drop of body weight was accompanied by leptin mRNA decrease in visceral fat tissue both in VEND and SRFD, as revealed by Real time PCR analysis. No difference in CB(1) mRNA receptor expression in hypothalamus and in visceral fat tissue among groups was observed. Leptin receptors were decreased in the hypothalamus of SRFD but not of VEND mice. Moreover, in SRFD and VEND mice the expression of orexigenic genes Neuropeptide Y and Agouti Related Protein (AGRP) was increased, while anorexigenic ones, Pro-OpioMelanoCortin (POMC) and Cocaine-and-Amphetamine-Regulated Transcript (CART) displayed no alteration in any group.

Our results demonstrate that there is a progressive negative shift inEGABAA, with the most positive values found in the youngest cortical precursor cells. At the early stages of neocortical development,EGABAA is determined by the chloride (Cl−) gradient, and the internal chloride concentration ([Cl−]i) decreases with development.EGABAA is positive to the resting potential, indicating that GABA serves to depolarize developing neocortical cells. Consistent with this conclusion, GABAAreceptor activation with muscimol was found to increase the internal calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in both embryonic and early postnatal neocortical cells through the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Postnatal cells exhibit spontaneous postsynaptic synaptic currents, which are eliminated by bicuculline methiodide (BMI) but not glutamate receptor antagonists and reverse at the Cl− equilibrium potential. Likewise, brief spontaneous increases in [Ca2+]i, sensitive to BMI and TTX, are observed at the same ages, suggesting that endogenous synaptic GABAA receptor activation can depolarize cells and activate VGCCs. These results suggest that GABAA receptor-mediated depolarization may influence early neocortical developmental events, including neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, through the activation of Ca2+-dependent signal transduction pathways.},

We demonstrate: 1) [Cl-]i is higher in the most superficial areas in both neocortical and thalamic brain slices at all ages tested and, 2) there is a developmental decrease in [Cl-]i that is independent of acute trauma caused by brain slicing. We conclude that [Cl-]i has a developmental progression during P5-20 in both the neocortex and thalamus.

Bioavailability of 75 percent is assumed from a mixed diet. The RDA for young adults is 1.3 mg. Recently, the median intake of vitamin B6 from food in the United States was approximately 2 mg/day for men and 1.4 mg/day for women; in one Canadian population study the median intake was approximately 1.8 mg/day for men and 1.3 mg/day for women. The ninety-fifth percentile of U.S. intake from both food and supplements has been estimated to be 6 to 10 mg/day. The critical adverse effect from high intake of the vitamin is sensory neuropathy. The data fail to demonstrate a causal association between pyridoxine intake and other endpoints (e.g., dermatological lesions and vitamin B6 dependency in newborns).

	abstract = {The gut is home to trillions of microorganisms that have fundamental roles in many aspects of human biology, including immune function and metabolism1,2. The reduced diversity of the gut microbiota in Western populations compared to that in populations living traditional lifestyles presents the question of which factors have driven microbiota change during modernization. Microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) found in dietary fibre have a crucial involvement in shaping this microbial ecosystem, and are notably reduced in the Western diet (high in fat and simple carbohydrates, low in fibre) compared with a more traditional diet3. Here we show that changes in the microbiota of mice consuming a low-MAC diet and harbouring a human microbiota are largely reversible within a single generation. However, over several generations, a low-MAC diet results in a progressive loss of diversity, which is not recoverable after the reintroduction of dietary MACs. To restore the microbiota to its original state requires the administration of missing taxa in combination with dietary MAC consumption. Our data illustrate that taxa driven to low abundance when dietary MACs are scarce are inefficiently transferred to the next generation, and are at increased risk of becoming extinct within an isolated population. As more diseases are linked to the Western microbiota and the microbiota is targeted therapeutically, microbiota reprogramming may need to involve strategies that incorporate dietary MACs as well as taxa not currently present in the Western gut.},

	abstract = {Acute hypoglycaemia impairs cerebral function, and available data indicate that cognitive performance becomes impaired at a blood glucose level of 2.6-3.0 mmol/l in healthy subjects. Methodological problems limit comparisons between studies, but in general complex tasks are more sensitive to hypoglycaemia than simple tasks, and some cognitive abilities are completely abolished. The onset of hypoglycaemic cognitive dysfunction is immediate, but recovery may be considerably delayed. There is persuasive evidence of adaptation to hypoglycaemia, partly due to increased brain glucose uptake capacity, although other mechanisms may exist. Patients who are exposed to chronic or recurrent hypoglycaemia become remarkably tolerant to the state, but this is insufficient to prevent severe hypoglycaemia with neuroglycopenic decompensation, probably because symptomatic and counterregulatory responses adapt even more. During experimental hypoglycaemia, administration of non-glucose cerebral fuels preserves cognitive function. However, little progress has been made as yet towards protecting cognitive function during hypoglycaemia in clinical practice. The chronic effects of recurrent hypoglycaemia remain contentious. There are numerous case reports of hypoglycaemic brain damage and of cognitive deterioration attributed to repeated severe hypoglycaemia. The major prospective studies, including the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, did not report cognitive declines in intensively treated patients, but had unrepresentative study populations and may have been too short to detect such effects. Structural and functional brain changes are not only associated with recurrent severe hypoglycaemia, but also with hyperglycaemia and early disease onset and may in part be due to hyperglycaemic microvascular disease. Children may be more prone to acute metabolic insults, and there is evidence of developmental disadvantage associated with hypoglycaemic episodes.},

Acute hypoglycemia impairs cognitive function in several domains. Executive cognitive function governs organization of thoughts, prioritization of tasks, and time management. This study examined the effect of acute hypoglycemia on executive function in adults with and without diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Thirty-two adults with and without type 1 diabetes with no vascular complications or impaired awareness of hypoglycemia were studied. Two hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps were performed at least 2 weeks apart in a single-blind, counterbalanced order, maintaining blood glucose at 4.5 mmol/L (euglycemia) or 2.5 mmol/L (hypoglycemia). Executive functions were assessed with a validated test suite (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function). A general linear model (repeated-measures ANOVA) was used. Glycemic condition (euglycemia or hypoglycemia) was the within-participant factor. Between-participant factors were order of session (euglycemia-hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia-euglycemia), test battery used, and diabetes status (with or without diabetes).

RESULTS
Compared with euglycemia, executive functions (with one exception) were significantly impaired during hypoglycemia; lower test scores were recorded with more time required for completion. Large Cohen d values ({\textgreater}0.8) suggest that hypoglycemia induces decrements in aspects of executive function with large effect sizes. In some tests, the performance of participants with diabetes was more impaired than those without diabetes.

CONCLUSIONS
Executive cognitive function, which is necessary to carry out many everyday activities, is impaired during hypoglycemia in adults with and without type 1 diabetes. This important aspect of cognition has not received previous systematic study with respect to hypoglycemia. The effect size is large in terms of both accuracy and speed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently use of herbal medicines, have been considered as an alternative for therapeutic usage. So, this study was undertaken to evaluate the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of fenugreek seeds in type 2 diabetic patients.
METHODS: In a clinical trial study, 24 type 2 diabetic patients were placed on 10 grams/day powdered fenugreek seeds mixed with yoghurt or soaked in hot water for 8 weeks. Weight, FBS, HbA(1)C, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and food record were measured before and after the study. The differences observed in food records, BMI and serum variables were analyzed using paired-t-test and t-student and P{\textless}or=0.05 was considered as significant.
RESULTS: After exclusion of 6 cases for changing in medication or personal problems, the results of 18 patients (11 consumed fenugreek in hot water and 7 in yoghurt) were studied. Findings showed that FBS, TG and VLDL-C decreased significantly (25 \%, 30 \% and 30.6 \% respectively) after taking fenugreek seed soaked in hot water whereas there were no significantly changes in lab parameters in cases consumed it mixed with yoghurt. BMI, Energy, Carbohydrate, Protein and fat intake remained unchanged during study.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that fenugreek seeds can be used as an adjuvant in the control of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the form of soaked in hot water.},

Based on animal research and our previous human studies, we set out to investigate intranasal administration of OXT and hypothesized that OXT should be able to modulate sexual function in women.
        Methods In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover laboratory setting, the acute effects of intranasal administered OXT (24 international units) on sexual drive, arousal, orgasm, and refractory aspects of sexual behavior were analyzed in 27 healthy females (mean age ± SD, 27.52 ± 8.04) together with physiological parameters using vaginal photoplethysmography.
        Findings Oxytocin administration showed no effect on subjective sexual parameters (eg, postorgasmic tension; P = 0.051). Physiological parameters (vaginal photoplethysmography amplitude and vaginal blood volume) showed a response pattern towards sexual arousal but were not affected by OXT.
        Implications Using a well-established laboratory paradigm, we did not find that intranasal OXT influences female sexual parameters. Also, sexual drive and other functions were not affected by OXT. These findings indicate that OXT is not able to significantly increase subjective and objective parameters of sexual function in a setting with high internal validity; however, this might be different in a more naturalistic setting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation has been proven to play a crucial role in early brain injury pathogenesis and represents a target for treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Astaxanthin (ATX), a dietary carotenoid, has been shown to have powerful anti-inflammation property in various models of tissue injury. However, the potential effects of ATX on neuroinflammation in SAH remain uninvestigated. The goal of this study was to investigate the protective effects of ATX on neuroinflammation in a rat prechiasmatic cistern SAH model.
METHODS: Rats were randomly distributed into multiple groups undergoing the sham surgery or SAH procedures, and ATX (25 mg/kg or 75 mg/kg) or equal volume of vehicle was given by oral gavage at 30 min after SAH. All rats were sacrificed at 24 h after SAH. Neurologic scores, brain water content, blood-brain barrier permeability, and neuronal cell death were examined. Brain inflammation was evaluated by means of expression changes in myeloperoxidase, cytokines (interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α), adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), and nuclear factor kappa B DNA-binding activity.
RESULTS: Our data indicated that post-SAH treatment with high dose of ATX could significantly downregulate the increased nuclear factor kappa B activity and the expression of inflammatory cytokines and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in both messenger RNA transcription and protein synthesis. Moreover, these beneficial effects lead to the amelioration of the secondary brain injury cascades including cerebral edema, blood-brain barrier disruption, neurological dysfunction, and neuronal degeneration.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ATX treatment is neuroprotective against SAH, possibly through suppression of cerebral inflammation.},

	abstract = {Flavonoids exert a multiplicity of neuroprotective actions within the brain, including a potential to protect neurons against injury induced by neurotoxins, an ability to suppress neuroinflammation, and the potential to promote memory, learning and cognitive function. These effects appear to be underpinned by two common processes. Firstly, they interact with critical protein and lipid kinase signalling cascades in the brain leading to an inhibition of apoptosis triggered by neurotoxic species and to a promotion of neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. Secondly, they induce beneficial effects on the vascular system leading to changes in cerebrovascular blood flow capable of causing angiogenesis, neurogenesis and changes in neuronal morphology. Through these mechanisms, the consumption of flavonoid-rich foods throughout life holds the potential to limit neurodegeneration and to prevent or reverse age-dependent loses in cognitive performance. The intense interest in the development of drugs capable of enhancing brain function means that flavonoids may represent important precursor molecules in the quest to develop of a new generation of brain enhancing drugs.},

Herein, the isolation of seven NAAs and the assessment of their effects on major protein targets in the ECS network are reported. Four NAAs, octadeca-2E,4E,8E,10Z,14Z-pentaene-12-ynoic acid isobutylamide (1), octadeca-2E,4E,8E,10Z,14Z-pentaene-12-ynoic acid 2'-methylbutylamide (2), hexadeca-2E,4E,9Z-triene-12,14-diynoic acid isobutylamide (3), and hexadeca-2E,4E,9,12-tetraenoic acid 2'-methylbutylamide (4), were identified from Heliopsis helianthoides var. scabra. Compounds 2-4 are new natural products, while 1 was isolated for the first time from this species. The previously described macamides, N-(3-methoxybenzyl)-(9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadecatrienamide (5), N-benzyl-(9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadecatrienamide (6), and N-benzyl-(9Z,12Z)-octadecadienamide (7), were isolated from Lepidium meyenii (Maca). N-Methylbutylamide 4 and N-benzylamide 7 showed submicromolar and selective binding affinities for the cannabinoid CB1 receptor (Ki values of 0.31 and 0.48 μM, respectively). Notably, compound 7 also exhibited weak fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibition (IC50 = 4 μM) and a potent inhibition of anandamide cellular uptake (IC50 = 0.67 μM) that was stronger than the inhibition obtained with the controls OMDM-2 and UCM707. The pronounced ECS polypharmacology of compound 7 highlights the potential involvement of the arachidonoyl-mimicking 9Z,12Z double-bond system in the linoleoyl group for the overall cannabimimetic action of NAAs. This study provides additional strong evidence of the endocannabinoid substrate mimicking of plant-derived NAAs and uncovers a direct and indirect cannabimimetic action of the Peruvian Maca root.},

In whole-cell patch clamp mode, methanol extract of Withania somnifera (mWS) induced short-lived and repeatable inward currents in all SG neurons tested (31.3 Â± 8.51 pA, n = 7) using a high chloride pipette solution. The mWS-induced inward currents were concentration dependent and maintained in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), a voltage gated Na (+) channel blocker, CNQX, a non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, AP5, an NMDA receptor antagonist and strychnine, a glycine receptor antagonist. The mWS induced currents were blocked by picrotoxin, a GABAA receptor antagonist. These results show that mWS has an inhibitory effects on SG neurons of the Vc through GABAA receptor-mediated activation of chloride ion channels, indicating that mWS contains compounds with sedative effects on the central nervous system. These results also suggest that mWS may be a potential target for modulating orofacial pain processing.},

	abstract = {Background
Scopolamine is a well-known cholinergic antagonist that causes amnesia in human and animal models. Scopolamine-induced amnesia in rodent models has been widely used to understand the molecular, biochemical, behavioral changes, and to delineate therapeutic targets of memory impairment. Although this has been linked to the decrease in central cholinergic neuronal activity following the blockade of muscarinic receptors, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanism(s) particularly the effect on neuroplasticity remains elusive. In the present study, we have investigated (i) the effects of scopolamine on the molecules involved in neuronal and glial plasticity both in vivo and in vitro and (ii) their recovery by alcoholic extract of Ashwagandha leaves (i-Extract).

Methodology/Principal Findings
As a drug model, scopolamine hydrobromide was administered intraperitoneally to mice and its effect on the brain function was determined by molecular analyses. The results showed that the scopolamine caused downregulation of the expression of BDNF and GFAP in dose and time dependent manner, and these effects were markedly attenuated in response to i-Extract treatment. Similar to our observations in animal model system, we found that the scopolamine induced cytotoxicity in IMR32 neuronal and C6 glioma cells. It was associated with downregulation of neuronal cell markers NF-H, MAP2, PSD-95, GAP-43 and glial cell marker GFAP and with upregulation of DNA damage- Î³H2AX and oxidative stress- ROS markers. Furthermore, these molecules showed recovery when cells were treated with i-Extract or its purified component, withanone.

Conclusion
Our study suggested that besides cholinergic blockade, scopolamine-induced memory loss may be associated with oxidative stress and Ashwagandha i-Extract, and withanone may serve as potential preventive and therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders and hence warrant further molecular analyses.},

	abstract = {Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a variety of physical, mental, and behavioral symptoms that start during the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and the symptoms disappear after the onset of menses. Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels during luteal phase in women associated with PMS have more alterations than women not suffering from PMS. In this regard, altered luteal BDNF levels in women with PMS might play a role in a set of psychological and somatic symptoms of the PMS. Studies of last decade revealed neuroprotective effects of curcumin and its ability to increase BDNF levels. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of curcumin on serum BDNF level and PMS symptoms severity in women with PMS. Present study is a Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial. Curcumin treatment was given for three successive menstrual cycles and each cycle ran 10 days. After having identified persons with PMS, participants were randomly allocated into placebo (n=35) and curcumin (n=35) groups. Each sample in placebo and curcumin groups received two capsules daily for seven days before menstruation and for three days after menstruation for three successive menstrual cycles. Participants noted the severity of the symptoms mentioned in the daily record questionnaire. Self-report was used to determine menstrual cycle phase of participants. At the fourth day of each menstrual cycle venous blood samples were collected for BDNF measurement by ELISA method. Before intervention, BDNF levels and mean scores of PMS symptoms (mood, behavioral and physical symptoms) between two groups showed no significant differences. But in curcumin group first, second and third cycles after interventions BDNF levels were significantly higher and mean scores of PMS symptoms were significantly less than placebo group. Based on our results part of these beneficial effects of curcumin may be mediated through enhancing serum BDNF levels in women with PMS.},

Here, we show that a natural compound curcumol, acts as an allosteric enhancer of GABAARs in a manner distinct from benzodiazepines. Curcumol markedly facilitated GABA-activated currents and shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the left in cultured hippocampal neurons. When co-applied with the classical benzodiazepine diazepam, curcumol further potentiated GABA-induced currents. In contrast, in the presence of a saturating concentration of menthol, a positive modulator for GABAAR, curcumol failed to further enhance GABA-induced currents, suggesting shared mechanisms underlying these two agents on GABAARs. Moreover, the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil did not alter the enhancement of GABA response by curcumol and menthol, but abolished that by DZP. Finally, mutations at the β2 or γ2 subunit predominantly eliminated modulation of recombinant GABAARs by curcumol and menthol, or diazepam, respectively. Curcumol may therefore exert its actions on GABAARs at sites distinct from benzodiazepine sites. These findings shed light on the future development of new therapeutics drugs targeting GABAARs.},

	abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) potentiates excitatory synapses in a variety of systems by promoting presynaptic transmitter release. The existing evidence indicates that BDNF attenuates inhibitory transmission, but reports differ considerably in their characterization of the effect and proposed mechanisms. We examined the effects of exogenously applied BDNF on EPSCs and IPSCs recorded from functionally identified neurons in dissociated rat hippocampal cultures. When recording from glutamatergic neurons, we found that BDNF exerted differential effects at excitatory versus inhibitory synapses: increasing amplitude of EPSCs but slightly decreasing that of IPSCs. Furthermore, when recording from GABAergic neurons, we found that BDNF increased the IPSC amplitude. That these differential BDNF effects reflect distinct presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms was suggested by the BDNF-induced changes in miniature EPSCs and IPSCs. An increased mini-frequency was found at all synapses, indicating elevated presynaptic transmitter secretion; a change in the amplitude of mini-IPSCs was found at GABAergic cells, suggesting postsynaptic modulation of GABA responses. Selective postsynaptic mechanisms were further examined by comparing the effect of BDNF on GABA-induced currents recorded from glutamatergic versus GABAergic cells. For GABAergic but not glutamatergic postsynaptic cells, BDNF induced a shift in the reversal potential (EIPSC) toward more positive levels, hence reducing the inhibitory action of IPSCs. This BDNF-induced effect correlates with the existing level of furosemide-sensitive K+-Cl- transport activity in the postsynaptic cell. Thus, BDNF may decrease the efficacy of inhibitory transmission by acute postsynaptic downregulation of Cl- transport, in addition to its well known presynaptic effect.},

The acetaldehyde metabolism and the shift of the NAD/NADH ratio in the cellular environment (reductive stress) are stressed. The toxic effects of acetaldehyde are mentioned.

The formation of carbon-centered (1-hydroxyethyl) and oxygen-centered (hydroxyl) radicals during the metabolism of ethanol is considered: the generation of hydroxyethyl radicals, which occurs likely during the process of univalent reduction of dioxygen, is highlighted and is carried out by ferric cytochrome P450 oxy-complex (P450–Fe3+O2·−) formed during the reduction of heme-oxygen. The ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation has been evaluated, and it has been shown that plasma F2-isoprostanes are increased in ethanol toxicity.},

In isolated vesicles prepared from rat cerebral cortex, ethanol, at concentrations that are present during acute intoxication (20-50 mM), stimulated 36Cl- uptake in a concentration-dependent and biphasic manner. The ethanol-stimulated uptake of 36Cl- was markedly inhibited by the GABA antagonists picrotoxin and bicuculline but not by a variety of other neurotransmitter receptor antagonists. The effects of ethanol in stimulating 36Cl- uptake in isolated brain vesicles were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that of pentobarbital. Ethanol also markedly potentiated both muscimol- and pentobarbital-stimulated 36Cl- uptake at concentrations below those that directly stimulate 36Cl- uptake. Under our incubation conditions, ethanol did not release GABA, suggesting that it interacts with the postsynaptic GABA/barbiturate receptor complex.

	abstract = {Reactive oxygen species are constantly produced in aerobic organisms as by-products of normal oxygen metabolism and include free radicals such as superoxide anion (O2−) and hydroxyl radical (OH−), and non-radical hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The mitochondrial respiratory chain and enzymatic reactions by various enzymes are endogenous sources of reactive oxygen species. Exogenous reactive oxygen species -inducing stressors include ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, and divergent oxidizing chemicals. At low concentrations, reactive oxygen species serve as an important second messenger in cell signaling; however, at higher concentrations and long-term exposure, reactive oxygen species can damage cellular macromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and lipids, which leads to necrotic and apoptotic cell death. Oxidative stress is a condition of imbalance between reactive oxygen species formation and cellular antioxidant capacity due to enhanced ROS generation and/or dysfunction of the antioxidant system. Biochemical alterations in these macromolecular components can lead to various pathological conditions and human diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases are morphologically featured by progressive cell loss in specific vulnerable neuronal cells, often associated with cytoskeletal protein aggregates forming inclusions in neurons and/or glial cells. Deposition of abnormal aggregated proteins and disruption of metal ions homeostasis are highly associated with oxidative stress. The main aim of this review is to present as much detailed information as possible that is available on various neurodegenerative disorders and their connection with oxidative stress. A variety of therapeutic strategies designed to address these pathological processes are also described. For the future therapeutic direction, one specific pathway that involves the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 is receiving considerable attention.},

There is a significant variation in the dietary requirement for choline that can be explained by common genetic polymorphisms. Because of its wide-ranging roles in human metabolism, from cell structure to neurotransmitter synthesis, choline-deficiency is now thought to have an impact on diseases such as liver disease, atherosclerosis and possibly neurological disorders. Choline is found in a wide variety of foods. Egg yolks are the most concentrated source of choline in the American diet, providing 680 milligrams per 100 grams. Mean choline intakes for older children, men, women and pregnant women are far below the Adequate Intake established by the IOM. Given the importance of choline in a wide range of critical functions in the human body, coupled with less than optimal intakes among the population, dietary guidance should be developed to encourage the intake of choline-rich foods.},

Cistanches Herba extract (CHE; 250 Î¼g/ml) increased NGF induction in C6 cells and led to neurite extension in PC12 cells. It also stimulated NGF secretion in the cortex and hippocampus of the mouse brain at 5 and 20mg/kg/day (3 days, p.o.). Furthermore, CHE increased neuronal cell differentiation, neurite length, and synapse formation in the mouse hippocampus.

Now, we found that AMP N1-oxide stimulated the phosphorylation of not only mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) but also that of cAMP/calcium-response element-binding protein (CREB) in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of MAPK activation by a MEK inhibitor, PD98059, did not influence the AMP N1-oxide-induced neuritegenesis, whereas that of protein kinase A (PKA) by a selective inhibitor, KT5720, significantly reduced neurite outgrowth. AMP N1-oxide also had the activity of suppressing the growth of PC12 cells, which correlated well with the neurite outgrowth-promoting activity. KT5720 restored the growth of AMP N1-oxide-treated PC12 cells. It is well known that nerve growth factor suppresses proliferation of PC12 cells before causing stimulation of neuronal differentiation. Thus, AMP N1-oxide elicited neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, as evidenced by generation of neurites, and inhibited cell growth through adenosine A2A receptor-mediated PKA signaling, which may be responsible for characteristic actions of RJ.},

	abstract = {Background
Eurycoma longifolia is a medicinal plant commonly called tongkat ali (TA) and “Malaysian ginseng.” TA roots are a traditional “anti-aging” remedy and modern supplements are intended to improve libido, energy, sports performance and weight loss. Previous studies have shown properly-standardized TA to stimulate release of free testosterone, improve sex drive, reduce fatigue, and improve well-being.

Methods
We assessed stress hormones and mood state in 63 subjects (32 men and 31 women) screened for moderate stress and supplemented with a standardized hot-water extract of TA root (TA) or Placebo (PL) for 4 weeks. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with significance set at p {\textless} 0.05 was used to determine differences between groups.

Results
Significant improvements were found in the TA group for Tension (−11\%), Anger (−12\%), and Confusion (−15\%). Stress hormone profile (salivary cortisol and testosterone) was significantly improved by TA supplementation, with reduced cortisol exposure (−16\%) and increased testosterone status (+37\%).

Conclusion
These results indicate that daily supplementation with tongkat ali root extract improves stress hormone profile and certain mood state parameters, suggesting that this “ancient” remedy may be an effective approach to shielding the body from the detrimental effects of “modern” chronic stress, which may include general day-to-day stress, as well as the stress of dieting, sleep deprivation, and exercise training.},

	abstract = {Background
This paper documents a retrospective pilot study of a novel approach for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with amino acid precursors of serotonin and dopamine in conjunction with urinary monoamine assays subjected to organic cation transporter (OCT) functional status determination. The goal of this research was to document the findings and related considerations of a retrospective chart review study designed to identify issues and areas of concern that will define parameters for a prospective controlled study.

Methods
This study included 85 patients, aged 4–18 years, who were treated with a novel amino acid precursor protocol. Their clinical course during the first 8–10 weeks of treatment was analyzed retrospectively. The study team consisted of PhD clinical psychologists, individuals compiling clinical data from records, and a statistician. The patients had been treated with a predefined protocol for administering amino acid precursors of serotonin and dopamine, along with OCT assay interpretation as indicated.

Results
In total, 67\% of participants achieved significant improvement with only amino acid precursors of serotonin and dopamine. In patients who achieved no significant relief of symptoms with only amino acid precursors, OCT assay interpretation was utilized. In this subgroup, 30.3\% achieved significant relief following two or three urine assays and dosage changes as recommended by the assay results. The total percentage of patients showing significant improvement was 77\%.

Conclusion
The efficacy of this novel protocol appears superior to some ADHD prescription drugs, and therefore indicates a need for further studies to verify this observation. The findings of this study justify initiation of further prospective controlled studies in order to evaluate more formally the observed benefits of this novel approach in the treatment of ADHD.},

	abstract = {Background
Two primary categories of nutritional deficiency exist. An absolute nutritional deficiency occurs when nutrient intake is not sufficient to meet the normal needs of the system, and a relative nutritional deficiency exists when nutrient intake and systemic levels of nutrients are normal, while a change occurs in the system that induces a nutrient intake requirement that cannot be supplied from diet alone. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the primary component of chronic centrally acting monoamine (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) disease is a relative nutritional deficiency induced by postsynaptic neuron damage.

Materials and methods
Monoamine transporter optimization results were investigated, reevaluated, and correlated with previous publications by the authors under the relative nutritional deficiency hypothesis. Most of those previous publications did not discuss the concept of a relative nutritional deficiency. It is the purpose of this paper to redefine the etiology expressed in these previous writings into the realm of relative nutritional deficiency, as demonstrated by monoamine transporter optimization. The novel and broad range of amino acid precursor dosing values required to address centrally acting monoamine relative nutritional deficiency properly is also discussed.

Results
Four primary etiologies are described for postsynaptic neuron damage leading to a centrally acting monoamine relative nutritional deficiency, all of which require monoamine transporter optimization to define the proper amino acid dosing values of serotonin and dopamine precursors.

Conclusion
Humans suffering from chronic centrally acting monoamine-related disease are not suffering from a drug deficiency; they are suffering from a relative nutritional deficiency involving serotonin and dopamine amino acid precursors. Whenever low or inadequate levels of monoamine neurotransmitters exist, a relative nutritional deficiency is present. These precursors must be administered simultaneously under the guidance of monoamine transporter optimization in order to achieve optimal relative nutritional deficiency management. Improper administration of these precursors can exacerbate and/or facilitate new onset of centrally acting monoamine-related relative nutritional deficiencies.},

	abstract = {Studies have shown that aspirin may decrease blood pressure when given at bedtime but not when administered on awakening. However, until now, a biologically plausible mechanism of this striking phenomenon was not revealed. We investigated the effect of 100 mg of aspirin administered at bedtime compared with administration on awakening on plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels over 24 hours and excretion of cortisol and catecholamines in 24-hour urine samples. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial was performed in 16 grade 1 hypertensive subjects. During 2 periods of 2 weeks separated by a 4-week washout period, participants used aspirin both at morning and at night, which was blinded with placebo. After both periods, subjects were admitted for 24 hours to measure the aforementioned parameters. Aspirin intake at bedtime compared with on awakening reduced average (24-hour) plasma renin activity by 0.08 μg/L per hour (95\% CI: 0.03 to 0.13 μg/L per hour; P=0.003) without affecting aldosterone levels (95\% CI: −0.01 to 0.01 nmol/L; P=0.93). Cortisol excretion in 24-hour urine was 52 nmol/24 hours (95\% CI: 5 to 99 nmol/24 hours; P=0.05) lower, and dopamine and norepinephrine excretions were 0.25 μmol/24 hours (95\% CI: 0.01 to 0.48 μmol/24 hours; P=0.04) and 0.22 μmol/24 hours (95\% CI: −0.03 to 0.46 μmol/24 hours; P=0.02) lower in patients treated with bedtime aspirin. In conclusion, aspirin taken at bedtime compared with on awakening significantly diminished 24-hour plasma renin activity and excretion of cortisol, dopamine, and norepinephrine in 24-hour urine. Decreased activity of these pressor systems forms a biologically plausible explanation for the finding that aspirin at night may reduce blood pressure, whereas aspirin at morning does not.},

	abstract = {Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease (AD) are multifaceted and there are currently a limited number of therapeutic strategies available to treat them. Aspirin is known to act on multiple therapeutic targets and is a successful anti-inflammatory agent in various tissues. The present study aimed to ascertain the performance of aspirin when employed as a therapeutic agent to treat neurodegeneration on novel targets, including opioid system genes, in an AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity mouse model. The effects of two doses of aspirin (5 and 20 mg/kg aspirin for 12 days) were investigated in an AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity mouse model (150 mg/kg AlCl3 for 12 days). Neurological improvements were assessed through different behavioral tests and the effects of aspirin on opioid system gene expression levels were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Both doses resulted in improvements in cognitive behavior. A 5 mg/kg dose of aspirin was revealed to be effective for spatial memory improvement (7.14±0.84 sec), whilst a 20 mg/kg dose was superior for improving extinction learning (7.63±4.04\%). Aspirin (5 mg/kg) also significantly improved contextual memory (48.05±10.6\%) when compared with the AlCl3-treated group (1.49±0.62\%; P{\textless}0.001). Aspirin was also observed to significantly decrease δ-opioid receptor expression in the cortex (1.09±0.08 and 1.27±0.08, respectively) at both doses (5 and 20 mg/kg) when compared with the AlCl3-treated group (3.69±1.43; P{\textless}0.05). Furthermore, aspirin at 5 mg/kg significantly reduced expression of prodynorphin in the cortex (0.57±0.20) when compared with the AlCl3-treated group (1.95±0.84; P{\textless}0.05). Notably, the effect of aspirin was significant in the cortex but not in the hippocampus. In summary, aspirin was effective in ameliorating the AD-like symptoms via the modulation of opioid systems. However, additional studies are required to determine the long term effects of aspirin on such conditions.},

	abstract = {Leveraging the knowledge of the foremost experts in the field, I can now release what I believe is a comprehensive explanation of the Vitamin D story. It's benefits are difficult to disentangle from those of healthy Sun Exposure though - the beneficial effects of D status may be hugely due to the sun exposure that got your D up! I use sun and UV sources to achieve my D levels as a result, not supplementation. Other key elements like K2, A, Mg etc are inextricably linked also, but here we focus mainly on D. Reverse Causality applies also - people who have inflammatory issues and are obese may drive down their D status, but data on this is sparse - but keep it in mind. Also important is that DAILY supplementation rather than big bolus dosing is used - the half-life of D3 is only a couple of days. This Seminar is of interest to Mothers \&amp; their Children particularly (e.g. see 15:00:00 to 21:00:00 segment), to avoid probability of serious chronic diseases, in childhood and beyond. The main message is that blood levels of D should be targeted towards healthy evolutionary levels, ideally through access to UVB / healthy sun exposure (NO burning).  So to stress again: there is a lot of associational "correlation but possibly not causation" data in this, and there is every possibility that Sun exposure delivers more benefits than D3 supplements (by the production of many other photoproducts in the skin), and also the modern carb-inflamed/diseased population may be causal in driving down 25(OH)D status (e.g. the obese people with low D - is it their fat sequestering away the D, or is their inflammation driving down their status?)

The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5\% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L. The largest meta-analysis ever conducted of studies published between 1966 and 2013 showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels {\textless}75 nmol/L may be too low for safety and associated with higher all-cause mortality, demolishing the previously presumed U-shape curve of mortality associated with vitamin D levels. Since all-disease mortality is reduced to 1.0 with serum vitamin D levels ≥100 nmol/L, we call public health authorities to consider designating as the RDA at least three-fourths of the levels proposed by the Endocrine Society Expert Committee as safe upper tolerable daily intake doses. This could lead to a recommendation of 1000 IU for children {\textless}1 year on enriched formula and 1500 IU for breastfed children older than 6 months, 3000 IU for children {\textgreater}1 year of age, and around 8000 IU for young adults and thereafter.

	abstract = {Background
Cardamom is a well-known spice in Indian subcontinent, used in culinary and traditional medicine practices since ancient times. The current investigation was untaken to evaluate the potential benefit of cardamom powder supplementation in high carbohydrate high fat (HCHF) diet induced obese rats.

Method
Male Wistar rats (28 rats) were divided into four different groups such as Control, Control + cardamom, HCHF, HCHF + cardamom. High carbohydrate and high fat (HCHF) diet was prepared in our laboratory. Oral glucose tolerance test, organs wet weight measurements and oxidative stress parameters analysis as well as liver marker enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities were assayed on the tissues collected from the rats. Plasma lipids profiles were also measured in all groups of animals. Moreover, histological staining was also performed to evaluate inflammatory cells infiltration and fibrosis in liver.

Results
The current investigation showed that, HCHF diet feeding in rats developed glucose intolerance and increased peritoneal fat deposition compared to control rats. Cardamom powder supplementation improved the glucose intolerance significantly (p {\textgreater} 0.05) and prevented the abdominal fat deposition in HCHF diet fed rats. HCHF diet feeding in rats also developed dyslipidemia, increased fat deposition and inflammation in liver compared to control rats. Cardamom powder supplementation significantly prevented the rise of lipid parameters (p {\textgreater} 0.05) in HCHF diet fed rats. Histological assessments confirmed that HCHF diet increased the fat deposition and inflammatory cells infiltration in liver which was normalized by cardamom powder supplementation in HCHF diet fed rats. Furthermore, HCHF diet increased lipid peroxidation, decreased antioxidant enzymes activities and increased advanced protein oxidation product level significantly (p {\textgreater} 0.05) both in plasma and liver tissue which were modulated by cardamom powder supplementation in HCHF diet fed rats. HCHF diet feeding in rats also increased the ALT, AST and ALP enzyme activities in plasma which were also normalized by cardamom powder supplementation in HCHF diet fed rats. Moreover, cardamom powder supplementation ameliorated the fibrosis in liver of HCHF diet fed rats.

Conclusion
This study suggests that, cardamom powder supplementation can prevent dyslipidemia, oxidative stress and hepatic damage in HCHF diet fed rats.},

	abstract = {Cannabidiol (CBD) is a major, biologically active, but psycho-inactive component of cannabis. In this cell culture-based report, CBD is shown to displace the agonist, [3H]8-OH-DPAT from the cloned human 5-HT1a receptor in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, the major psychoactive component of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) does not displace agonist from the receptor in the same micromolar concentration range. In signal transduction studies, CBD acts as an agonist at the human 5-HT1a receptor as demonstrated in two related approaches. First, CBD increases [35S]GTPgammaS binding in this G protein coupled receptor system, as does the known agonist serotonin. Second, in this GPCR system, that is negatively coupled to cAMP production, both CBD and 5-HT decrease cAMP concentration at similar apparent levels of receptor occupancy, based upon displacement data. Preliminary comparative data is also presented from the cloned rat 5-HT2a receptor suggesting that CBD is active, but less so, relative to the human 5-HT1a receptor, in binding analyses. Overall, these studies demonstrate that CBD is a modest affinity agonist at the human 5-HT1a receptor. Additional work is required to compare CBD's potential at other serotonin receptors and in other species. Finally, the results indicate that cannabidiol may have interesting and useful potential beyond the realm of cannabinoid receptors.},

	abstract = {Background
It has recently been shown that the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast rejuvenates aged brains in rats. The question is whether this commonly used, systemic, anti-asthmatic medicine has a similar effect in humans?

Results
We approached this issue by doing statistical analyses based on the Norwegian Prescription Database. The Database lists all prescription-based medications in Norway, but not drugs given to people who are in hospitals or nursing homes. The question asked was whether users of montelukast, compared to users of inhalation asthma medicine, live longer, and are less likely to develop dementia. A small, non-significant protective effect on the use of dementia medicine became significant when adjusting for other prescriptions (based on the notion that montelukast users on average are less healthy). A possible protective effect was substantiated by looking at the lack of prescriptions as a proxy for dementia-related residency in nursing homes, and the risk of death.

Conclusions
The present results suggest that montelukast may alleviate the cognitive decline associated with human aging. However, further data, preferably based on controlled clinical trials, are required.},

For the first time, we have demonstrated that the MBO cultures exhibit increased blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability as shown by IgG leakage into the brain parenchyma, astrocyte activation as evidenced by increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neuronal damage-response as suggested by increased vimentin-positive neurons occur upon histamine treatment. Identical responses—a breakdown of the BBB, astrocyte activation, and neuronal expression of vimentin—were then demonstrated in brains from AD patients compared to age-matched controls, consistent with other reports.

Agmatine, given i.p. (0.5-20.0 mg/kg) or i.c.v. (0.5-2.5 micrograms), augmented basal gastric acid secretion in conscious rats to a maximum of 40\% when given i.p. and 44\% when given i.c.v. Agmatine also potentiated total secretory volume as well as gastric acid and pepsin output in pylorus-ligated rats. When administered before exposure to stress, agmatine significantly decreased gastric glandular mucus levels and exacerbated stress-induced gastric mucosal injury. These results are in contrast to our data showing that an exogenous agonist of I1-imidazoline receptors, moxonidine, is a potent antisecretory and gastroprotective agent. A precise physiological role for agmatine in blood pressure regulation and in gastrointestinal function awaits clarification. However, it is possible that agmatine functions as an "inverse agonist" at central imidazoline receptors, resulting in hypertension, augmented gastric secretion and exacerbated gastric mucosal injury.},

Gastric injury was conducted by ligating celiac artery for 30 min and reperfusion for another 30 min. Gastric tissues were histologically studied and immunostained with angiopoietin 1 (Ang-1) and Ang-2. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured in gastric tissue homogenate. To assess whether AKt/phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) mediated the effect of AGM, an additional group was pretreated with Wortmannin (WM) (inhibitor of Akt/PI3K, 15 μg/kg, i.p.), prior to ischemic injury and AGM treatment, and examined histologically and immunostained. Another set of experiments was run to study vascular permeability of the stomach using Evan’s blue dye., RESULTS: AGM markedly reduced Evan’s blue dye extravasation (3.58 ± 0.975 μg/stomach vs 1.175 ± 0.374 μg/stomach, P {\textless} 0.05), VEGF (36.87 ± 2.71 pg/100 mg protein vs 48.4 ± 6.53 pg/100 mg protein, P {\textless} 0.05) and MCP-1 tissue level (29.5 ± 7 pg/100 mg protein vs 41.17 ± 10.4 pg/100 mg protein, P {\textless} 0.01). It preserved gastric histology and reduced congestion. Ang-1 and Ang-2 immunostaining were reduced in stomach sections of AGM-treated animals. The administration of WM abolished the protective effects of AGM and extensive hemorrhage and ulcerations were seen., CONCLUSION: AGM protects the stomach against I/R injury by reducing vascular permeability and inflammation. This protection is possibly mediated by Akt/PI3K.},

	abstract = {Regulation of agmatine homeostasis has so far only been poorly defined. In the present study, three mechanisms regulating human agmatine homeostasis were investigated. 1) Enzymatic regulation: expression of arginine decarboxylase, diamine oxidase, and ornithine decarboxylase in human colon neoplastic tissue was, at the mRNA level, about 75\% and 50\% lower and 150\% higher, respectively, than in the adjacent normal tissue; expression of agmatinase was unchanged. 2) Bacteria-derived agmatine: ten representative bacteria strains of the human intestinal microbiota considerably differed in agmatine production and its efflux into their surrounding fluid, suggesting that the composition of the intestinal microbiota influences the agmatine availability in the gut lumen for absorption. 3) Regulation of blood plasma agmatine concentration by the human liver: at low concentrations in portal venous blood plasma, agmatine either slightly increased or further decreased in blood plasma through liver passage. Above a threshold of 14 ng/ml agmatine in the portal venous blood plasma, substantial hepatic agmatine removal from blood occurred. Taken together, a perturbation of agmatine homeostasis has been proven to be involved in the regulation of malignant cell proliferation. The amount of agmatine available for absorption, which is an important physiological source of agmatine in the human organism, should differ considerably depending on the composition of the bacterial flora in the chyme since the various species of intestinal bacteria largely differ in their ability to form agmatine. Finally, evidence has been presented that the liver plays a crucial physiological role in the maintenance of agmatine homeostasis in the human organism.},

Pepsinogens provide a rich source of the amino acid arginine. Both the source of carbon dioxide, arginine, and the consequence of arginine decarboxylation, agmatine, have been studied. The site of carbon dioxide production has been related to the survival of the parietal cell. An immunohistochemical study has been carried out on glycol methacrylate embedded gastric biopsies from the normal stomach of 38 adult patients. The sections have been stained using polyclonal antibody to pepsinogen II, polyclonal antibody to agmatine, and polyclonal antibody to Helicobacter pylori. Pepsinogen II and agmatine are found in the parietal cell canaliculi. This is consistent with the production of carbon dioxide from arginine in the parietal cell canaliculi. Evidence is presented for the decarboxylation of arginine derived from the activation segment of pepsinogen as the source of carbon dioxide for the production of gastric acid. The production of carbon dioxide by the decarboxylation of arginine in the parietal cell canaliculus enables the extracellular hydration of carbon dioxide at the known site of carbonic anhydrase activity. The extracellular production of acid in the canaliculus together with the presence of agmatine helps to explain why the parietal cells are not destroyed during the formation of gastric acid. Agmatine is found in the mucus secreting cells of the stomach and its role in acid protection of the stomach is discussed. Anat Rec, 2009. Â© 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Agmatine is an endogenous decarboxylation product of arginine that has been previously shown to antagonize the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and inhibit nitric-oxide synthase. Many neuropharmacological studies have shown that exogenous administration of agmatine prevents or reverses biological phenomena dependent on central nervous system glutamatergic systems, including opioid-induced tolerance, opioid self-administration, and chronic pain. However, the central nervous system (CNS) pharmacokinetic profile of agmatine remains minimally defined. The present study determined the spinal cord pharmacokinetics and acute pharmacodynamics of intrathecally administered agmatine in mice. After a single bolus intrathecal injection, agmatine concentrations in spinal cord (cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral) tissue and serum were quantified by an isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography fluorescence detection system. Agmatine persisted at near maximum concentrations in all levels of the spinal cord for several hours with a half-life of approximately 12 h. Initial agmatine concentrations in serum were 10\% those in CNS. However, the serum half-life was less than 10 min after intrathecal injection of agmatine, consistent with previous preliminary pharmacokinetic reports of systemically administered agmatine. The pharmacodynamic response to agmatine in the NMDA-nociceptive behavior and thermal hyperalgesia tests was assessed. Whereas MK-801 (dizocilpine maleate) inhibits these two responses with equal potency, agmatine inhibits the thermal hyperalgesia with significantly increased potency compared with the nociceptive behavior, suggesting two sites of action. In contrast to the pharmacokinetic results, the agmatine inhibition of both behaviors had a duration of only 10 to 30 min. Collectively, these results suggest the existence of a currently undefined agmatinergic extracellular clearance process in spinal cord.},

He provides an even more compelling prospective: periodic starvation helps the body clean house (i.e., eat weak and aberrant cells) in the same way sleep helps clean the brain at night.

He also discusses how too much dietary protein—the macronutrient that purportedly prevents our muscles from shriveling up—can accelerate growth and aging.

06:18 Ageing and age-related chronic diseases can be regulated through genetic intervention or with nutritional interventions. Nutrients control the genes, which control the protection and the rejuvenation of the cell. 
08:40 Starvation has a much greater and faster impact than temporary caloric restriction. Once eating has resumed, you are fueled and begin rebuilding. Weaker cells are consumed during a fasting mimicry diet. By eating all the time we have eliminated this important tool. 
15:46 Excess protein is damaging to those of us under the age of 65, increasing rates of cancer and overall mortality. 
19:29 Proteins control growth factor/growth hormone which controls IGF-1, which also controls mTOR. Carbohydrates control pKa. Together they accelerate ageing and inhibit regeneration. 
20:51 Athletes need to have enough protein in the regeneration refeed. Having too much protein impedes muscle formation and blocks stem cells. 
24:59 Just adhering to the Fasting Mimicry Diet 5 days out of 30 is enough to have a significant drop in IGF-1, cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and inflammation. 
28:06 If you fast over 12 hours every day, you have a two-fold increase in the risk of needing to have your gallbladder removed. Data indicates that skipping breakfast is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and increased overall mortality. 
37:46 Fasting Mimicry Diet is the result of years of researching the connection of each component of food and the genes that regulate ageing and regeneration. 
40:45 Dr. Longo’s Morning Routine: He drinks a mix of black tea and green tea with a whole lemon and preserved fruit. He rides stationary bike and breaks his fast after exercise. 
44:04 Dr. Longo’s Desert Island Nutrient: He would bring garbanzo beans for their nutrition and taste. Around the world, locations with record longevity have one commonality is the high consumption of beans.

	url = {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PyyatqJSE},
	abstract = {Dr. Rhonda Patrick speaks with Dr. Valter Longo, a professor of gerontology and biological sciences and director of the longevity institute at the University of Southern California. Dr. Longo has made huge contributions to the field of aging, including the role of fasting and diet in longevity and healthspan in humans as well as metabolic fasting therapies for the treatment of human diseases.

In this conversation, Rhonda and Valter discuss...
• The effects of prolonged fasting, which refers to 2-3 day fasting intervals in mice and 4-5 days in humans.
• Dr. Longo’s work on the fasting-mimicking diet, which is 5 day restricted diet that is meant to simulate some of the biological effects of prolonged fasting while still allowing some food.
• How clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy for this diet for type 2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and cancer patients.
• Fasting as an inducer of differential stress resistance, where it can simultaneously make cancer cells more sensitive to death while also making healthy cells more resistant to these same death stimuli (such as chemotherapy) which might otherwise induce cell death amongst healthy cells as collateral damage.
• Fasting as a biological state which humans historically experienced with extreme regularity and we may ultimately need in order to mitigate various disease states.
• The effects of prolonged fasting on the immune system, namely, how it clears away damaged white blood cells via autophagy and how this causes hematopoietic stem cells to self renew and make more stem cells and also produce new blood cells to fully replenish the white blood cell population.
• How prolonged fasting causes a shift in the immune cell population towards one that is more representative of youth by normalizing the ratio of myeloid cells to lymphoid cells.
• The positive effects of prolonged fasting and the fasting-mimicking diet on markers of systemic inflammation, blood glucose levels and other aging biomarkers.
• The conclusions of Dr. Longo \&amp; Dr. Marcus Bock’s research comparing 1 week of the fasting-mimicking diet followed by 6 months of mediterranean diet to six months of a ketogenic diet in people with multiple sclerosis.
• The strange, somewhat paradoxical role of autophagy genes in cancer progression and some of the open questions surrounding the exact role that these genes are playing.
• Dr. Longo’s high level thoughts on metformin as an anti-aging drug.
• How the growth hormone/IGF-1 axis is one of the most important genetic pathways in aging from yeast to worms to mice to humans.

	abstract = {Calorie restriction or changes in dietary composition can enhance healthy aging, but the inability of most subjects to adhere to chronic and extreme diets, as well as potentially adverse effects, limits their application. We randomized 100 generally healthy participants from the United States into two study arms and tested the effects of a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD)-low in calories, sugars, and protein but high in unsaturated fats-on markers/risk factors associated with aging and age-related diseases. We compared subjects who followed 3 months of an unrestricted diet to subjects who consumed the FMD for 5 consecutive days per month for 3 months. Three FMD cycles reduced body weight, trunk, and total body fat; lowered blood pressure; and decreased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). No serious adverse effects were reported. After 3 months, control diet subjects were crossed over to the FMD program, resulting in a total of 71 subjects completing three FMD cycles. A post hoc analysis of subjects from both FMD arms showed that body mass index, blood pressure, fasting glucose, IGF-1, triglycerides, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and C-reactive protein were more beneficially affected in participants at risk for disease than in subjects who were not at risk. Thus, cycles of a 5-day FMD are safe, feasible, and effective in reducing markers/risk factors for aging and age-related diseases. Larger studies in patients with diagnosed diseases or selected on the basis of risk factors are warranted to confirm the effect of the FMD on disease prevention and treatment.},

FMD cycles restore insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in both a type 2 and type 1 diabetes mouse models. In human type 1 diabetes pancreatic islets, fasting conditions reduce PKA and mTOR activity and induce Sox2 and Ngn3 expression and insulin production. The effects of the FMD are reversed by IGF-1 treatment and recapitulated by PKA and mTOR inhibition. These results indicate that a FMD promotes the reprogramming of pancreatic cells to restore insulin generation in islets from T1D patients and reverse both T1D and T2D phenotypes in mouse models., A short term diet that mimics periodic fasting modulates beta cell number and promotes inuslin secretion and glucose homeostasis with implications for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.,},

The FMD reduced clinical severity in all mice, and completely reversed symptoms in 20\% of the animals. These improvements were associated with increased corticosterone levels and Treg cell number, reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TH1 and TH17 cells, and antigen presenting cells (APCs). Moreover, the FMD promoted oligodendrocyte precursor cell regeneration and remyelination in axons in response to both EAE and cuprizone MS models, supporting its effects on both suppression of autoimmunity and remyelination. We also report preliminary data suggesting that a FMD or a chronic ketogenic diet are safe, feasible and potentially effective in the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients (NCT01538355).},

Experimental mice were given Al(NO(3))(3) along with 50 mg/L of silicic acid or with 0.5 ml/day of beer. Al brain levels in the Al group were four times higher than those of control mice while silicic acid and beer group values were 40\% lower than those of the Al group. We have observed that beer prevented accumulation of lipid damage significantly, which resulted from aluminum intake. Decline in the expression of mRNA of endogenous antioxidant enzymes associated with aluminum administration was also inhibited by beer and silicic acid. The tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) RNA expression was normalized in silicic acid and beer groups. Very high and significant correlations were found for the different parameters tested suggesting that moderate consumption of beer, due to its silicon content, effectively protects against the neurotoxic effects of aluminum.},

However, "moderate" amounts of alcohol include drinking 3-4 alcohol beverages in a day, which is closer to binge drinking and may do more harm than good. Here we examined how daily drinking of moderate-high alcohol alters the production of new neurons in the adult hippocampus. Male and female adult Sprague-Dawley rats were provided free access to a liquid replacement diet that was supplemented with either 4\% ethanol or Maltodextrin for a period of 2 weeks. Proliferating cells were labeled with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and the number of BrdU-positive cells in the hippocampus was assessed after the final day of drinking. A subset of rats was also exposed to a motor skill or associative learning task to examine the functional effects of alcohol consumption. The drinking regime resulted in an average blood alcohol concentration of approximately 0.08\%, which is comparable to the human legal driving limit in many countries. This level of intoxication did not impair motor skill learning or function in either sex, nor did the alcohol consumption disrupt associative learning 2 days after drinking. Therefore, moderate alcohol consumption did not disrupt basic sensory, motor or learning processes. However, the number of cells produced in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was reduced by nearly 40\%. Thus, even moderate consumption of alcohol for a relatively short period of time can have profound effects on structural plasticity in the adult brain.},

In this study, sensitive and specific in vitro bioassays for estrogens were used for an activity-guided fractionation of hops via selective solvent extraction and appropriate HPLC separation. We have identified a potent phytoestrogen in hops, 8-prenylnaringenin, which has an activity greater than other established plant estrogens. The estrogenic activity of this compound was reflected in its relative binding affinity to estrogen receptors from rat uteri. The presence of 8-prenylnaringenin in hops may provide an explanation for the accounts of menstrual disturbances in female hop workers. This phytoestrogen can also be detected in beer, but the levels are low and should not pose any cause for concern.},

However, consumption of phytoestrogen-rich diets can cause impaired fertility and reproductive tract disorders in some animals and the apparent decline in human sperm quality over recent decades may be related to increased exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors. The present study determines the effects of a short-term phytoestrogen supplement on semen quality and serum sex steroid and gonadotrophin levels in human males. Healthy volunteers took a supplement containing 40 mg of isoflavones daily for 2 months and donated blood and semen samples monthly for 2 months before and 4 months after supplementation. Semen samples were analysed for ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, motility and morphology. Blood samples were analysed for sex hormone and gonadotrophin levels and phytoestrogen concentrations, and testicular volume was measured using an orchidometer. The phytoestrogen supplement increased plasma genistein and daidzein concentrations to approx. 1 microM and 0.5 microM respectively; yet, there was no observable effect on endocrine measurements, testicular volume or semen parameters over the study period. This is the first study to examine the effects of a phytoestrogen supplement on reproductive health in males. We conclude that the phytoestrogen dose consumed had no effect on semen quality.},

	abstract = {Scientific achievements in the last two decades have revolutionized the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. This is mainly because of targeted therapies and a better understanding of the relationship between estrogen, its receptor, and breast cancer. One of these discoveries is the use of synthetic selective estrogen modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen in the treatment strategy for estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. Hundreds of thousands of lives have been saved because of this advance. Not only is tamoxifen used in the treatment strategy for patients who have breast cancer, but also for prevention in high risk premenopausal women. Another synthetic SERM, raloxifene, which was initially used to prevent osteoporosis, is also as effective as tamoxifen for prevention in high risk postmenopausal women. In certain regions of the world, particularly in Asia, a low incidence of breast cancer has been observed. These women have diets that are high in soy and low in fat, much unlike the western diet. Interest in the protective effects of soy derivatives has led to the research of phytoestrogens, metabolites of soy that are described by some as natural SERMs. As a result, many clinical questions have been raised as to whether phytoestrogens, which are also found in other natural foods, can protect against breast cancer. This article reviews the development and role of the more common SERMs, tamoxifen and raloxifene. In addition, this paper will also highlight the emerging studies on phytoestrogens and their similarity to SERMs.},

	abstract = {Background
The term “adrenal fatigue” (“AF”) has been used by some doctors, healthcare providers, and the general media to describe an alleged condition caused by chronic exposure to stressful situations. Despite this, “AF” has not been recognized by any Endocrinology society, who claim there is no hard evidence for the existence. The aim of this systematic review is to verify whether there is substantiation for “AF”.

Methods
A systematic search was performed at PUBMED, MEDLINE (Ebsco) and Cochrane databases, from the beginning of the data until April 22nd, 2016. Searched key words were: “adrenal” + “fatigue”, “adrenal” + “burnout”, “adrenal” + “exhaustion”, “hypoadrenia”, “burnout” + “cortisol”, “fatigue” + “cortisol”, “clinical” + “burnout”, “cortisol” + “vitalility”, “adrenal” + “vitality”, and “cortisol” + “exhaustion”. Eligibility criteria were: (1) articles written in English, (2) cortisol profile and fatigue or energy status as the primary outcome, (3) performed tests for evaluating the adrenal axis, (4) absence of influence of corticosteroid therapy, and (5) absence of confounding diseases. Type of questionnaire to distinct fatigued subjects, population studied, tests performed of selected studies were analyzed.

Results
From 3,470 articles found, 58 studies fulfilled the criteria: 33 were carried in healthy individuals, and 25 in symptomatic patients. The most assessed exams were “Direct Awakening Cortisol” (n = 29), “Cortisol Awakening Response” (n = 27) and “Salivary Cortisol Rhythm” (n = 26).

Discussion
We found an almost systematic finding of conflicting results derived from most of the studies methods utilized, regardless of the validation and the quality of performed tests. Some limitations of the review include: (1) heterogeneity of the study design; (2) the descriptive nature of most studies; (3) the poor quality assessment of fatigue; (4) the use of an unsubstantiated methodology in terms of cortisol assessment (not endorsed by endocrinologists); (5) false premises leading to an incorrect sequence of research direction; and, (6) inappropriate/invalid conclusions regarding causality and association between different information.

Conclusion
This systematic review proves that there is no substantiation that “adrenal fatigue” is an actual medical condition. Therefore, adrenal fatigue is still a myth.},

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurological condition in children. This pilot study evaluated the effects of high-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on the isolated plasma phospholipids and behavior in children with ADHD (primarily inattentive subtype and combined subtype).

Methods
Nine children were initially supplemented with 16.2 g EPA/DHA concentrates per day. The dosage was adjusted dependent on the ratio of arachidonic acid (AA) to EPA in the isolated plasma phospholipids at four weeks to reach a level normally found in the Japanese population.

Results
At the end of the eight-week study, supplementation resulted in significant increases in EPA and DHA, as well as a significant reduction in the AA:EPA ratio (20.78 ± 5.26 to 5.95 ± 7.35, p {\textless} 0.01). A psychiatrist (blind to supplement compliance or dosage modifications) reported significant improvements in behavior (inattention, hyperactivity, oppositional/defiant behavior, and conduct disorder). There was also a significant correlation between the reduction in the AA:EPA ratio and global severity of illness scores.

Conclusion
The findings of this small pilot study suggest supplementation with high-dose EPA/DHA concentrates may improve behavior in children with ADHD.},

Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that cutaneous application of citral on adolescent rats may induce benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-like and even atypical hyperplastic changes in the ventral lobes.

In addition, the study includes a comparative analysis of normal intact rats showing circadian variations of serum testosterone levels and rats in whom this rhythmic pattern was abolished either by excessive supplementation of exogenous androgen or by castration. Our results demonstrate an induction of benign as well as atypical prostatic hyperplasia following citral application. The most severe atypical changes were noted in the citral-treated rats with high serum testosterone levels. Although the mechanism of action of citral is yet unknown, the present results suggest a synergism between citral and testosterone resulting in hyperplastic changes in the rat ventral prostate. In addition, the results reconfirm that serum testosterone levels fluctuate according to a circadian rhythm in intact young and adolescent male rats. The application of citral tends to lower the morning circadian peaks, and the circadian pattern was abolished in orchiectomized rats and in those treated with testosterone implants.},

Serotonin (5-HT) is produced by neuroendocrine prostatic cells and presents in high concentration in normal prostatic transition zone, but its function in prostate physiology is unknown. Previous evidence demonstrated that neuroendocrine cells and 5-HT are decreased in BPH compared to normal prostate. Here, we show that 5-HT is a strong negative regulator of prostate growth. In vitro, 5-HT inhibits rat prostate branching through down-regulation of androgen receptor (AR). This 5-HT’s inhibitory mechanism is also present in human cells of normal prostate and BPH, namely in cell lines expressing AR when treated with testosterone. In both models, 5-HT’s inhibitory mechanism was replicated by specific agonists of 5-Htr1a and 5-Htr1b. Since peripheral 5-HT production is specifically regulated by tryptophan hydroxylase 1(Tph1), we showed that Tph1 knockout mice present higher prostate mass and up-regulation of AR when compared to wild-type, whereas 5-HT treatment restored the prostate weight and AR levels. As 5-HT is decreased in BPH, we present here evidence that links 5-HT depletion to BPH etiology through modulation of AR. Serotoninergic prostate pathway should be explored as a new therapeutic target for BPH.},

Investigations of the mechanism of action of citral showed that application of citral directly to the vagina in female, ovariectomized rats resulted in an increased proliferation of vaginal epithelium and a significant increase in the BrdUrd incorporation in vaginal epithelial cells, in short a similar effect to that of estrogen application. In an in vitro assay citral proved to inhibit estrogen binding to estrogen receptors, while no such inhibition was observed with testosterone for androgen receptors. These observations together with the estrogen implication in the BPH and the reported incidence of gynecomastia following exposure to geraniol, a precursor of citral, strongly suggest that the prostatic hyperplasia-inducing capacity of citral may be due to its estrogenic action.},

Fasting is characterised by profound changes in energy metabolism including progressive loss of body proteins. The underlying mechanisms are however unknown and we therefore determined the effects of a 72-hour-fast on human skeletal muscle protein metabolism and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulator of cell growth.

Methods
Eight healthy male volunteers were studied twice: in the postabsorptive state and following 72 hours of fasting. Regional muscle amino acid kinetics was measured in the forearm using amino acid tracers. Signaling to protein synthesis and breakdown were assessed in skeletal muscle biopsies obtained during non-insulin and insulin stimulated conditions on both examination days.

Results
Fasting significantly increased forearm net phenylalanine release and tended to decrease phenylalanine rate of disappearance. mTOR phosphorylation was decreased by ∼50\% following fasting, together with reduced downstream phosphorylation of 4EBP1, ULK1 and rpS6. In addition, the insulin stimulated increase in mTOR and rpS6 phosphorylation was significantly reduced after fasting indicating insulin resistance in this part of the signaling pathway. Autophagy initiation is in part regulated by mTOR through ULK1 and fasting increased expression of the autophagic marker LC3B-II by ∼30\%. p62 is degraded during autophagy but was increased by ∼10\% during fasting making interpretation of autophagic flux problematic. MAFbx and MURF1 ubiquitin ligases remained unaltered after fasting indicating no change in protesomal protein degradation.

Conclusions
Our results show that during fasting increased net phenylalanine release in skeletal muscle is associated to reduced mTOR activation and concomitant decreased downstream signaling to cell growth.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy of Acetyl-l-Carnitine (ALC), at different dosages, on specific anhedonic symptoms in detoxified alcohol dependent subjects. Secondary endpoints were the effect of ALC on melancholic and negative symptoms.
METHOD: Sixty-four anhedonic alcohol dependent patients with minor or absent withdrawal symptoms were randomized: 23 received ALC at a dosage of 3g/day, 21 received ALC at a dosage of 1g/day, and 20 were given placebo. ALC was given intravenously for 10days, followed by 80days of oral treatment plus a follow-up period of 45days. The presence of anhedonic symptoms was determined by the SHAPS (Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale) and the VASa (Visual Analogue Scale for Anhedonia); negative and melancholic symptoms were evaluated by the SANS (Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms), and the BRMS (Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale).
RESULTS: The natural course of anhedonia in the placebo group showed a decline until day 30 and remains stable for the rest of the study. Intravenously ALC accelerated the improvement of anhedonia reaching constant low levels early, on day 10. At this step levels of anhedonia (SHAPS, VASa) and melancholic symptoms (BRMES) resulted significantly reduced (p{\textless}0.05) in both the ALC 3g and ALC 1g groups with respect to placebo; SANS scores significantly reduced only in the ALC 1g respect to placebo (p=0.014). During oral treatment with ALC, anhedonia scores did not differ from placebo.
CONCLUSION: Intravenously ALC was effective in accelerating the abstinence-associated improvement of anhedonia, melancholic and negative symptoms, whereas oral ALC treatment starting on day 10 showed no further improvements. Accordingly, in alcohol dependent subjects, ALC may be considered as a new potentially useful drug for the treatment of anhedonia.},

	abstract = {Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) is a drug currently under investigation for Alzheimer disease (AD) therapy. ALCAR seems to exert a number of central nervous system (CNS)-related effects, even though a clear pharmacological action that could explain clinical results in AD has not been identified yet. The aim of this study was to determine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biological correlates of ALCAR effects in AD after a short-term, high-dose, intravenous, open treatment. Results show that ALCAR CSF levels achieved under treatment were significantly higher than the ones at baseline, reflecting a good penetration through the blood-brain barrier and thus a direct CNS challenge. ALCAR treatment produced no apparent change on CSF classic neurotransmitters and their metabolite levels (homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, MHPG, dopamine, choline). Among CSF peptides, while corticotropin-releasing hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone remained unchanged, beta-endorphins significantly decreased after treatment; plasma cortisol levels matched this reduction. Since both CSF beta-endorphins and plasma cortisol decreased, one possible explanation is that ALCAR reduced the AD-dependent hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis hyperactivity. At present, no clear explanation can be proposed for the specific mechanism of this action.},

	shorttitle = {The cumulative cost of additional wakefulness},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To inform the debate over whether human sleep can be chronically reduced without consequences, we conducted a dose-response chronic sleep restriction experiment in which waking neurobehavioral and sleep physiological functions were monitored and compared to those for total sleep deprivation.
DESIGN: The chronic sleep restriction experiment involved randomization to one of three sleep doses (4 h, 6 h, or 8 h time in bed per night), which were maintained for 14 consecutive days. The total sleep deprivation experiment involved 3 nights without sleep (0 h time in bed). Each study also involved 3 baseline (pre-deprivation) days and 3 recovery days.
SETTING: Both experiments were conducted under standardized laboratory conditions with continuous behavioral, physiological and medical monitoring.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of n = 48 healthy adults (ages 21-38) participated in the experiments.
INTERVENTIONS: Noctumal sleep periods were restricted to 8 h, 6 h or 4 h per day for 14 days, or to 0 h for 3 days. All other sleep was prohibited.
RESULTS: Chronic restriction of sleep periods to 4 h or 6 h per night over 14 consecutive days resulted in significant cumulative, dose-dependent deficits in cognitive performance on all tasks. Subjective sleepiness ratings showed an acute response to sleep restriction but only small further increases on subsequent days, and did not significantly differentiate the 6 h and 4 h conditions. Polysomnographic variables and delta power in the non-REM sleep EEG-a putative marker of sleep homeostasis--displayed an acute response to sleep restriction with negligible further changes across the 14 restricted nights. Comparison of chronic sleep restriction to total sleep deprivation showed that the latter resulted in disproportionately large waking neurobehavioral and sleep delta power responses relative to how much sleep was lost. A statistical model revealed that, regardless of the mode of sleep deprivation, lapses in behavioral alertness were near-linearly related to the cumulative duration of wakefulness in excess of 15.84 h (s.e. 0.73 h).
CONCLUSIONS: Since chronic restriction of sleep to 6 h or less per night produced cognitive performance deficits equivalent to up to 2 nights of total sleep deprivation, it appears that even relatively moderate sleep restriction can seriously impair waking neurobehavioral functions in healthy adults. Sleepiness ratings suggest that subjects were largely unaware of these increasing cognitive deficits, which may explain why the impact of chronic sleep restriction on waking cognitive functions is often assumed to be benign. Physiological sleep responses to chronic restriction did not mirror waking neurobehavioral responses, but cumulative wakefulness in excess of a 15.84 h predicted performance lapses across all four experimental conditions. This suggests that sleep debt is perhaps best understood as resulting in additional wakefulness that has a neurobiological "cost" which accumulates over time.},

	issn = {1075-5535},
	doi = {10.1089/acm.2004.10.767},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Diurnal cortisol secretion levels were measured and circadian cortisol profiles were evaluated in a pilot study conducted to test the hypothesis that grounding the human body to earth during sleep will result in quantifiable changes in cortisol. It was also hypothesized that grounding the human body would result in changes in sleep, pain, and stress (anxiety, depression, irritability), as measured by subjective reporting.
SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Twelve (12) subjects with complaints of sleep dysfunction, pain, and stress were grounded to earth during sleep for 8 weeks in their own beds using a conductive mattress pad. Saliva tests were administered to establish pregrounding baseline cortisol levels. Levels were obtained at 4-hour intervals for a 24-hour period to determine the circadian cortisol profile. Cortisol testing was repeated at week 6. Subjective symptoms of sleep dysfunction, pain, and stress were reported daily throughout the 8-week test period.
RESULTS: Measurable improvements in diurnal cortisol profiles were observed, with cortisol levels significantly reduced during night-time sleep. Subjects' 24-hour circadian cortisol profiles showed a trend toward normalization. Subjectively reported symptoms, including sleep dysfunction, pain, and stress, were reduced or eliminated in nearly all subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that grounding the human body to earth ("earthing") during sleep reduces night-time levels of cortisol and resynchronizes cortisol hormone secretion more in alignment with the natural 24-hour circadian rhythm profile. Changes were most apparent in females. Furthermore, subjective reporting indicates that grounding the human body to earth during sleep improves sleep and reduces pain and stress.},

Such effects relate to inflammation, immune responses, wound healing, and prevention and treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The purpose of this report is two-fold: to 1) inform researchers about what appears to be a new perspective to the study of inflammation, and 2) alert researchers that the length of time and degree (resistance to ground) of grounding of experimental animals is an important but usually overlooked factor that can influence outcomes of studies of inflammation, wound healing, and tumorigenesis. Specifically, grounding an organism produces measurable differences in the concentrations of white blood cells, cytokines, and other molecules involved in the inflammatory response. We present several hypotheses to explain observed effects, based on current research results and our understanding of the electronic aspects of cell and tissue physiology, cell biology, biophysics, and biochemistry. An experimental injury to muscles, known as delayed onset muscle soreness, has been used to monitor the immune response under grounded versus ungrounded conditions. Grounding reduces pain and alters the numbers of circulating neutrophils and lymphocytes, and also affects various circulating chemical factors related to inflammation.},

The mass spectra of all the compounds at atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization display the most intense peaks of protonated molecular ions; the detection limits for these compounds are 10 fmol per sample. AA-Gly showed the highest inhibitory activity toward fatty acid amide hydrolase from rat brain (IC50 6.5 microM) among all the acylamino acids studied. AA-Phe, AA-Tyr, and AA-GABA exhibited a weak but detectable inhibitory effect (IC50 55, 60, and 50 microM, respectively). The acylated amino acids themselves, except for AA-Gly, were stable to the hydrolysis by this enzyme. All the arachidonoylamino acids inhibited cabbage phospholipase D to various degrees; AA-GABA and AA-Phe proved to be the most active (IC50 20 and 27 microM, respectively). Attempts to detect the biosynthesis of AA-Tyr in homogenates of rat liver and nerve tissue showed no formation in vitro of either this acylamino acid or AA-dopamine and AA-Phe, the products of its metabolism. The highest contents of these metabolites were detected in liver homogenate and in the brain homogenate, respectively. Acylamino acids exert no cytotoxic effect toward the glioma C6 cells. It was shown that N-acylation of Semax with arachidonic acid results in enhancement of its hydrolytic stability and increases its affinity for the sites of specific binding in rat cerebellum membranes.

The authors investigated the effects of exposure to blue-enriched white light during daytime workhours in an office setting.
METHODS: The experiment was conducted on 104 white-collar workers on two office floors. After baseline assessments under existing lighting conditions, every participant was exposed to two new lighting conditions, each lasting 4 weeks. One consisted of blue-enriched white light (17 000 K) and the other of white light (4000 K). The order was balanced between the floors. Questionnaire and rating scales were used to assess alertness, mood, sleep quality, performance, mental effort, headache and eye strain, and mood throughout the 8-week intervention.
RESULTS: Altogether 94 participants [mean age 36.4 (SD 10.2) years] were included in the analysis. Compared with white light (4000 K), blue-enriched white light (17 000 K) improved the subjective measures of alertness (P{\textless}0.0001), positive mood (P=0.0001), performance (P{\textless}0.0001), evening fatigue (P=0.0001), irritability (P=0.004), concentration (P{\textless}0.0001), and eye discomfort (P=0.002). Daytime sleepiness was reduced (P=0.0001), and the quality of subjective nocturnal sleep (P=0.016) was improved under blue-enriched white light. When the participants' expectation about the effect of the light treatments was entered into the analysis as a covariate, significant effects persisted for performance, alertness, evening fatigue, irritability, difficulty focusing, concentrating, and blurred vision.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to blue-enriched white light during daytime workhours improves subjective alertness, performance, and evening fatigue.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Prolonged exposure to blue wavelength light has been shown to have an alerting effect, and enhances performance on cognitive tasks. A small number of studies have also shown that relatively short exposure to blue light leads to changes in functional brain responses during the period of exposure. The extent to which blue light continues to affect brain functioning during a cognitively challenging task after cessation of longer periods of exposure (i.e., roughly 30 minutes or longer), however, has not been fully investigated.
METHODS: A total of 35 healthy participants (18 female) were exposed to either blue (469 nm) (n = 17) or amber (578 nm) (n = 18) wavelength light for 30 minutes in a darkened room, followed immediately by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while undergoing a working memory task (N-back task).
RESULTS: Participants in the blue light condition were faster in their responses on the N-back task and showed increased activation in the dorsolateral (DLPFC) and ventrolateral (VLPFC) prefrontal cortex compared to those in the amber control light condition. Furthermore, greater activation within the VLPFC was correlated with faster N-back response times.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to suggest that a relatively brief, single exposure to blue light has a subsequent beneficial effect on working memory performance, even after cessation of exposure, and leads to temporarily persisting functional brain changes within prefrontal brain regions associated with executive functions. These findings may have broader implication for using blue-enriched light in a variety of work settings where alertness and quick decision-making are important.},

	abstract = {Light regulates multiple non-image-forming (or nonvisual) circadian, neuroendocrine, and neurobehavioral functions, via outputs from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Exposure to light directly enhances alertness and performance, so light is an important regulator of wakefulness and cognition. The roles of rods, cones, and ipRGCs in the impact of light on cognitive brain functions remain unclear, however. A small percentage of blind individuals retain non-image-forming photoreception and offer a unique opportunity to investigate light impacts in the absence of conscious vision, presumably through ipRGCs. Here, we show that three such patients were able to choose nonrandomly about the presence of light despite their complete lack of sight. Furthermore, 2 sec of blue light modified EEG activity when administered simultaneously to auditory stimulations. fMRI further showed that, during an auditory working memory task, less than a minute of blue light triggered the recruitment of supplemental prefrontal and thalamic brain regions involved in alertness and cognition regulation as well as key areas of the default mode network. These results, which have to be considered as a proof of concept, show that non-image-forming photoreception triggers some awareness for light and can have a more rapid impact on human cognition than previously understood, if brain processing is actively engaged. Furthermore, light stimulates higher cognitive brain activity, independently of vision, and engages supplemental brain areas to perform an ongoing cognitive process. To our knowledge, our results constitute the first indication that ipRGC signaling may rapidly affect fundamental cerebral organization, so that it could potentially participate to the regulation of numerous aspects of human brain function.},

	abstract = {Acute exposure to light within the blue wavelengths has been shown to enhance alertness and vigilance, and lead to improved speed on reaction time tasks, possibly due to activation of the noradrenergic system. It remains unclear, however, whether the effects of blue light extend beyond simple alertness processes to also enhance other aspects of cognition, such as memory performance. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a thirty minute pulse of blue light versus placebo (amber light) exposure in healthy normally rested individuals in the morning during verbal memory consolidation (i.e., 1.5 hours after memory acquisition) using an abbreviated version of the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II). At delayed recall, individuals who received blue light (n = 12) during the consolidation period showed significantly better long-delay verbal recall than individuals who received amber light exposure (n = 18), while controlling for the effects of general intelligence, depressive symptoms and habitual wake time. These findings extend previous work demonstrating the effect of blue light on brain activation and alertness to further demonstrate its effectiveness at facilitating better memory consolidation and subsequent retention of verbal material. Although preliminary, these findings point to a potential application of blue wavelength light to optimize memory performance in healthy populations. It remains to be determined whether blue light exposure may also enhance performance in clinical populations with memory deficits.},

The ability of blue light to increase alertness, mood and cognitive function via non-image forming neuropathways has been suggested as a non-pharmacological countermeasure for depression across a range of occupational settings.
OBJECTIVES: This experimental study compared blue light and caffeine and aimed to test the effects of blue light/placebo (BLU), white light/240-mg caffeine (CAF), blue light/240-mg caffeine (BCAF) and white light/placebo (PLA), on mood.
METHODS: A randomised, controlled, crossover design study was used, in a convenience population of 20 healthy volunteers. The participants rated their mood on the Swedish Core Affect Scales (SCAS) prior to and after each experimental condition to assess the dimensions of valence and activation.
RESULTS: There was a significant main effect of light (p = 0.009), and the combination of blue light and caffeine had clear positive effects on core effects (ES, ranging from 0.41 to 1.20) and global mood (ES, 0.61 ± 0.53).
CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of the combination of blue light and caffeine should be further investigated across a range of applications due to the observed effects on the dimensions of arousal, valence and pleasant activation.},

	abstract = {The alerting effects of both caffeine and short wavelength (blue) light have been consistently reported. The ability of blue light to enhance alertness and cognitive function via non-image forming neuropathways have been suggested as a non-pharmacological countermeasure for drowsiness across a range of occupational settings. Here we compare and contrast the alerting and psychomotor effects of 240 mg of caffeine and a 1-h dose of {\textasciitilde}40 lx blue light in a non-athletic population. Twenty-one healthy subjects performed a computer-based psychomotor vigilance test before and after each of four randomly assigned trial conditions performed on different days: white light/placebo; white light/240 mg caffeine; blue light/placebo; blue light/240 mg caffeine. The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale was used to assess subjective measures of alertness. Both the caffeine only and blue light only conditions enhanced accuracy in a visual reaction test requiring a decision and an additive effect was observed with respect to the fastest reaction times. However, in a test of executive function, where a distraction was included, caffeine exerted a negative effect on accuracy. Furthermore, the blue light only condition consistently outperformed caffeine when both congruent and incongruent distractions were presented. The visual reactions in the absence of a decision or distraction were also enhanced in the blue light only condition and this effect was most prominent in the blue-eyed participants. Overall, blue light and caffeine demonstrated distinct effects on aspects of psychomotor function and have the potential to positively influence a range of settings where cognitive function and alertness are important. Specifically, despite the widespread use of caffeine in competitive sporting environments, the possible impact of blue light has received no research attention.},

In a bilateral comparison clinical study, daily exposure of psoriatic plaques to broad-band UVB (290–320 nm) or 312-nm UVB depleted T cells from the epidermis and dermis of psoriatic lesions. However, 312-nm UVB was significantly more depleting in both tissue compartments. To characterize the mechanism of T cell depletion, assays for T cell apoptosis were performed on T cells derived from UVB-irradiated skin in vivo and on T cells irradiated in vitro with 312-nm UVB. Apoptosis was induced in T cells exposed to 50–100 mJ/cm2 of 312-nm UVB in vitro, as measured by increased binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–Annexin V to CD3+ cells and by characteristic cell size/granularity changes measured by cytometry. In vivo exposure of psoriatic skin lesions to 312-nm UVB for 1–2 wk also induced apoptosis in T cells as assessed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) reaction in tissue sections, by binding of FITC–Annexin V to CD3+ T cells contained in epidermal cell suspensions, and by detection of apoptosis-related size shifts of CD3+ cells. Induction of T cell apoptosis could be the main mechanism by which 312-nm UVB resolves psoriasis skin lesions.},

	abstract = {Background Oral 8-methoxypsoralen–UV-A (PUVA) and narrowband UV-B (NB-UVB or UVB TL-01) are effective and widely used treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis. Although the role of PUVA therapy in skin carcinogenesis in humans with psoriasis has been clearly demonstrated, there is still controversy regarding the risk of skin cancer with NB-UVB. Furthermore, there is no clear evidence about the maximum cumulative number of sessions not to be exceeded in a lifetime. Objectives To assess the respective cutaneous carcinogenic risks of PUVA or NB-UVB in psoriasis; to estimate the respective dose-relationship between skin cancers and PUVA or NB-UVB; to estimate a maximum number of sessions for PUVA or NB-UVB not to be exceeded in a lifetime. Methods A systematic literature search was carried out in Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library databases from1980 to December 2010 in English and French, with the keywords ‘Psoriasis’ AND ‘UVB therapy’ AND ‘UVA therapy’ AND ‘cancer’ AND ‘skin’ OR ‘neoplasm’ OR ‘cutaneous carcinoma’ OR ‘melanoma’. Results Of 243 identified references, 49 published studies were included. Most of them (45/49) concerned PUVA therapy, with 41 assessing the risk of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) following PUVA. All publications referring to the US prospective PUVA follow-up study revealed an increased risk of NMSC with the following characteristics: risk most pronounced for squamous cell carcinomas developing even with low exposures and increasing linearly with the number of sessions, tumors occurring also on non-exposed skin including invasive penile tumors, risk persisting after cessation of treatment. An increased risk of basal cell carcinomas was observed in patients receiving more than hundred PUVA sessions. The four prospective European studies selected in our review and most of the pre-1990 European and US retrospective studies failed to find a link between exposure to PUVA and skin cancer. Only the most recent cohorts, including three large long-term retrospective European studies comparing records with their respective national cancer registries reported on an independent increased risk of NMSC with PUVA, The risk was lower as compared to the US prospective PUVA follow-up study. Six studies assessed the risk of melanoma following PUVA therapy: two of the three US publications coming from the same PUVA prospective follow-up study revealed an increased risk with more than doubled incidence of both invasive and in situ melanoma among patients exposed to at least 200 PUVA treatments compared with patients exposed to lower doses, whereas the three retrospectives European studies, comparing the incidence of melanoma in PUVA users with national cancer registers, did not find any increased risk of melanoma. No increased risk of skin cancer was evidenced in the four studies specifically assessing the potential carcinogenic risk of NB-UVB Conclusion There is an increased risk of skin cancer following PUVA, shown by both US and European studies. The greater risk measured by the US studies may be at least partly explained by high UVA dose exposure and the lighter phototypes of the treated patients. The lack of prospective studies in psoriasis patients treated with NB-UVB constitutes a barrier to the robust assessment of carcinogenic risk of this phototherapy technique.},

Especially hericenones and erinacines isolated from its fruiting body stimulate nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis, which expects H. erinaceus to have some effects on brain functions and autonomic nervous system. Herein, we investigated the clinical effects of H. erinaceus on menopause, depression, sleep quality and indefinite complaints, using the Kupperman Menopausal Index (KMI), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Indefinite Complaints Index (ICI). Thirty females were randomly assigned to either the H. erinaceus (HE) group or the placebo group and took HE cookies or placebo cookies for 4 weeks. Each of the CES-D and the ICI score after the HE intake was significantly lower than that before. In two terms of the ICI, "insentive" and "palpitatio", each of the mean score of the HE group was significantly lower than the placebo group. "Concentration", "irritating" and "anxious" tended to be lower than the placebo group. Our results show that HE intake has the possibility to reduce depression and anxiety and these results suggest a different mechanism from NGF-enhancing action of H. erinaceus.},

In addition, measures of drug craving and mood states after presentation of cocaine-related cues were collected on two occasions: before and after 14 days of double-blind treatment with either citicoline or placebo. Subjects did not experience any side effects and citicoline treatment was associated with decreases in self-reported mood states associated with cocaine craving.

Spiroperidol binding (dopamine D2 receptors) and quinuclidinyl benzilate binding (muscarinic receptors) in striata of 19-month old mice was analyzed for animals that had received chronic administration of cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) incorporated into the chow consumed (100 or 500 mg kg-1 added per day) for the 7 months before they were killed. 2. Treated animals displayed an increase in the dopamine receptor densities of 11\% for those receiving 100 mg kg-1 and 18\% for those receiving 500 mg kg-1 as compared to the control aged animals that had received no CDP-choline. Control animals showed, from 2 months to 19 months of life, a 28\% decrease in the receptor density. No change in the affinity of the receptors for spiroperidol was found in the treated or untreated animals. 3. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor densities were also partially recovered by the same treatment in aged animals that showed a 14\% decrease of these receptors in this case. The muscarinic receptor density increased 6\% for the animals that received 100 mg kg-1 and 17\% for the animals that received 500 mg kg-1 without any change in the affinity of the receptor for quinuclidinyl benzilate. 4. Aged animals displayed a slight increase in brain membrane fluidity as indicated by a decrease in the polarization value of the non-polar fluorophore 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Interestingly, in the treated animals a greater increase in membrane fluidity was determined and found to be very similar for the two doses.5. It is concluded that chronic administration of CDP-choline to aged animals promoted a partial recovery of the striatum dopamine and acetylcholine receptor function normally reduced with aging, which might be explicable in terms of mechanisms involving fluidity of the brain neuronal membrane.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Choline is an essential nutrient and plays a critical role in brain development, cell signaling, nerve impulse transmission, and lipid transport and metabolism. This analysis aimed to assess usual intakes of choline and compare them with the dietary reference intakes for U.S. residents aged ≥ 2 years.
METHODS: The National Cancer Institute method was used to assess usual intakes of choline from foods according to data for participants in the 2009-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; n = 16,809).
RESULTS: Suboptimal intakes of choline are prevalent across many life-stage subpopulations in the United States. Only 10.8 ± 0.6\% of 2009-2012 NHANES participants aged ≥ 2 years (15.6 ± 0.8\% of males and 6.1 ± 0.6\% of females) achieved the adequate intake (AI) for choline. Children aged 2-3 years were the most likely to exceed the AI (62.9 ± 3.1\%), followed by children aged 4-8 years (45.4 ± 1.6\%) and children aged 9-13 years (9.0 ± 1.0\%), compared to adolescents aged 14-18 years (1.8 ± 0.4\%) and adults aged ≥ 19 years (6.6 ± 0.5\%). When comparing by age and gender, males consumed significantly more choline than females for all age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that there is a need to increase awareness among health professionals and consumers regarding potential suboptimal intakes of choline in the United States, as well as the critical role that choline plays in health maintenance throughout the lifespan. Food scientists and the food and dietary supplement industries should consider working collectively with government agencies to discuss strategies to help offset the percentage of the population that does not meet the AI. Revision of the dietary reference intakes for choline should include replacement of the AI with an estimated average requirement and a recommended dietary allowance, so that more accurate population estimates of inadequate intakes may be calculated.},

Choline is widely distributed in foods; good sources include eggs, meats, cruciferous vegetables and legumes. The DRI for choline is expressed as Adequate Intake (AI).Methods: The USDA data base for choline values and USDA Standard Reference, Release 19 were used to complete choline values in foods listed in USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2.0. Choline intakes were estimated for all sources in NHANES survey data for 2003–2004. Distributions of usual intakes of total choline for population groups were estimated using PC SIDE 1.02 (Iowa State University) for the 2-day sample (n= 7581).Results: Mean choline usual intakes exceed the AI for young children. For older children, men, women and pregnant women, mean usual intakes are far below the AI; 10\% or less had usual intakes above the AI.Conclusions: Increased consumption of foods that are good sources of choline is needed to improve diets of groups with inadequate choline intakes.(Partial support: the Egg Nutrition Center).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Choline is an essential nutrient and plays a critical role in brain development, cell signaling, nerve impulse transmission, and lipid transport and metabolism. This analysis aimed to assess usual intakes of choline and compare them with the dietary reference intakes for U.S. residents aged ≥ 2 years.
METHODS: The National Cancer Institute method was used to assess usual intakes of choline from foods according to data for participants in the 2009-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; n = 16,809).
RESULTS: Suboptimal intakes of choline are prevalent across many life-stage subpopulations in the United States. Only 10.8 ± 0.6\% of 2009-2012 NHANES participants aged ≥ 2 years (15.6 ± 0.8\% of males and 6.1 ± 0.6\% of females) achieved the adequate intake (AI) for choline. Children aged 2-3 years were the most likely to exceed the AI (62.9 ± 3.1\%), followed by children aged 4-8 years (45.4 ± 1.6\%) and children aged 9-13 years (9.0 ± 1.0\%), compared to adolescents aged 14-18 years (1.8 ± 0.4\%) and adults aged ≥ 19 years (6.6 ± 0.5\%). When comparing by age and gender, males consumed significantly more choline than females for all age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that there is a need to increase awareness among health professionals and consumers regarding potential suboptimal intakes of choline in the United States, as well as the critical role that choline plays in health maintenance throughout the lifespan. Food scientists and the food and dietary supplement industries should consider working collectively with government agencies to discuss strategies to help offset the percentage of the population that does not meet the AI. Revision of the dietary reference intakes for choline should include replacement of the AI with an estimated average requirement and a recommended dietary allowance, so that more accurate population estimates of inadequate intakes may be calculated.},

	abstract = {Choline is needed for the maintenance of the structural integrity and signaling functions of cell membranes, for neurotransmission, and for transport of lipids and as a source of methyl groups. Choline can be made de novo in the body, but some individuals must also obtain choline in the diet to prevent deficiency symptoms. A number of environmental and genetic factors influence dietary requirements for choline, and average intakes in the population vary widely. Therefore, certain individuals may be at greater risk of choline deficiency. Choline is critical during fetal development, particularly during the development of the brain, where it can influence neural tube closure and lifelong memory and learning functions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although therapeutic intervention for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) at an early stage is important owing to the progressive nature of the disease, diagnosis using noninvasive methods remains difficult. We previously demonstrated NASH specific impairment of choline metabolism and the use of fasting plasma free choline (fCh) levels for NASH diagnosis. Here, we investigated the utility of an oral choline tolerance test (OCTT), based on disordered choline metabolism, as a novel noninvasive method for NASH diagnosis.
METHODS: Sixty-five patients with biopsy proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 17 healthy controls were enrolled. Blood samples were obtained from all subjects five times during the OCTT (before and 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after oral loading with 260 mg choline).
RESULTS: Four-hour fCh levels after oral loading choline were markedly increased in NASH patients, compared with non-NASH subjects. For detecting NASH, compared with non-NASH subjects, the area under the curve for 4-h fCh levels was 0.829 on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The cut-off level for NASH diagnosis was ≥0.16 mg/dL, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 80.1, 82.6, 78.4, and 84.4 \%, respectively. Moreover, 4-h fCh levels were significantly associated with the disease activity based on NAFLD activity score in patients with NAFLD.
CONCLUSIONS: Four-hour fCh levels obtained by an OCTT reflect a NASH specific disorder of choline metabolism, suggesting that the OCTT is a novel and useful noninvasive method for diagnosing NASH at an early stage with sufficient accuracy for clinical practice.},
