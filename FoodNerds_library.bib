	abstract = {SCOPE: The present study aimed to characterize and evaluate flavonoids effects on organic cation uptake in neuronal cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Uptake experiments were conducted using radiolabeled methyl-4-phenylpyridinuim ([(3) H]-MPP(+) ), in human neuronal dopaminergic cells, SH-SY5Y. Catechin did not alter [(3) H]-MPP(+) uptake, however its metabolite 4'-methyl-catechin decreased it by almost 50\%. Epicatechin and its methylated metabolites also decreased [(3) H]-MPP(+) uptake. Interestingly, the quercetin flavonol and its metabolite conjugated with glucuronic acid, as well as the flavanones naringenin and hesperitin, increased [(3) H]-MPP(+) uptake.
CONCLUSION: These results showed that different classes of flavonoids, as well as its metabolites, differently influence neuronal organic cation uptake. Several xeno- and endobiotics, including neurotransmitters, are organic cations. Specific food recommendations may be beneficial in pathological conditions where levels of neurotransmitters, as dopamine, are either increased or decreased.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the transmembrane transport of different flavonoids (flavan-3-ols, anthocyanins and flavonols) and some of their metabolites (methylated and conjugated with glucuronic acid) across hCMEC/D3 cells (a blood-brain barrier (BBB) model). Further metabolism of the tested compounds was assayed and their transport modulated in an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms behind this process. The transport across hCMEC/D3 cells was monitored in basolateral media at 1, 3 and 18 h by HPLC-DAD/MS. All the flavonoids and their metabolites were transported across hCMEC/D3 cells in a time-dependent manner. In general, the metabolites showed higher transport efficiency than the native flavonoid. No further biotransformation of the metabolites was found as consequence of cellular metabolism. Anthocyanins and their metabolites crossed this BBB cell model in a lipophilicity-dependent way. Quercetin transport was influenced by phosphatase modulators, suggesting a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation regulation mechanism. Overall, this work suggests that flavonoids are capable of crossing the BBB and reaching the central nervous system.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Limited data are available for evaluating the effects of oral carnitine supplementation on weight loss and metabolic profiles of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study was designed to determine the effects of oral carnitine supplementation on weight loss, and glycaemic and lipid profiles in women with PCOS.
DESIGN, PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 60 overweight patients diagnosed with PCOS were randomized to receive either 250 mg carnitine supplements (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) for 12 weeks. Fasting blood samples were obtained at the beginning and the end of the study to quantify parameters of glucose homoeostasis and lipid concentrations.
RESULTS: At the end of the 12 weeks, taking carnitine supplements resulted in a significant reduction in weight (-2·7 ± 1·5 vs +0·1 ± 1·8 kg, P {\textless} 0·001), BMI (-1·1 ± 0·6 vs +0·1 ± 0·7 kg/m(2) , P {\textless} 0·001), waist circumference (WC) (-2·0 ± 1·3 vs -0·3 ± 2·0 cm, P {\textless} 0·001) and hip circumference (HC) (-2·5 ± 1·5 vs -0·3 ± 1·8 cm, P {\textless} 0·001) compared with placebo. In addition, compared with placebo, carnitine administration in women with PCOS led to a significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (-0·38 ± 0·36 vs +0·11 ± 0·97 mmol/l, P = 0·01), serum insulin levels (-14·39 ± 25·80 vs +3·01 ± 37·25 pmol/l, P = 0·04), homoeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (-0·61 ± 1·03 vs +0·11 ± 1·43, P = 0·04) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (-3·64 ± 7·00 vs -0·59 ± 3·20 μmol/l, P = 0·03).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 12 weeks of carnitine administration in PCOS women resulted in reductions in weight, BMI, WC and HC, and beneficial effects on glycaemic control; however, it did not affect lipid profiles or free testosterone.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jep.2015.12.004},
	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Fructus Schisandrae is traditionally used as a liver-toning Chinese herb. Recent studies suggested Fructus Schisandrae could prevent high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis as well as improving anti-oxidative status within the liver, which is a proposed mechanism against statin-induced liver toxicity.
AIM: The aim of the present study was to determine if the combination use of Atorvastatin (AS) and Fructus Schisandrae aqueous extract (FSE) could (a) exert potent therapeutic effects not only on high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia, but also on hepatomegaly (enlarge of liver size) and hepatic steatosis (fatty liver); and (b) reduce side effects caused by intake of statin alone including increased incidence of elevated liver enzymes and liver toxicity in Sprague Dawley rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 5 groups of Sprague Dawley rats that were given the following treatment for 8 weeks: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii) High-fat diet (contains 21\% fat and 0.15\% cholesterol); (iii) High-fat diet (contains 21\% fat and 0.15\% cholesterol)+0.3\% Atorvastatin; (iv) High-fat diet (contains 21\% fat and 0.15\% cholesterol)+0.45\% FSE; (v) High-fat diet (contains 21\% fat and 0.15\% cholesterol)+0.3\% Atorvastatin+0.45\% FSE. After 8 weeks of treatment, body weight, adipose tissue and liver mass were measured, and liver and plasma lipid levels were determined to evaluate to effect of FSE with or without AS treatment on diet-induced obesity, hyperlipidemia and hepatic steatosis. Liver enzyme activities, anti-oxidative status and membrane permeability transition were also assessed to determine if FSE could reduce the side effects induced by AS.
RESULTS: From the results, FSE treatment alone resulted in significant inhibitory effect on diet-induced increase in: (a) body weight; (b) fat pad mass (epididymal, perirenal and inguinal fat); (c) liver weight; (d) total liver lipid; (e) liver triglyceride and cholesterol levels; and (f) plasma lipid levels, suggesting FSE has a potential preventive beneficial effect on weight control and lipid metabolism in Sprague Dawley rats with diet-induced obesity. However, FSE supplementation exerted no further beneficial effect on diet-induced metabolic syndrome when it is combined with AS treatment, compared with rats given AS-treatment alone. At the dose of 0.45\%, dietary FSE supplementation resulted in: (a) reduced liver enzymes (ALT and AST) levels; (b) reduced macrophage infiltration (CD68); (c) improved liver glutathione levels (anti-oxidative status); (d) reduced liver reactive oxidative species; (e) a trend to reduce calcium-induced membrane permeability transition within the liver. Most importantly, these improvements induced by FSE treatment were not only observed in the livers of rats given high-fat-diet, but also in high-fat-fed rats with atorvastatin-induced hepatotoxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggested FSE has a potential beneficial effect on weight control and lipid metabolism in Sprague Dawley rats with diet-induced obesity, and the combination use of FSE with AS could significantly prevent liver toxicity and anti-oxidative status induced by AS alone.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jep.2015.12.007},
	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tea infused with the seed of Cassia obtusifolia has been traditionally used as an herbal remedy for liver, eye, and acute inflammatory diseases. Recent pharmacological reports have indicated that Cassiae semen has neuroprotective effects, attributable to its anti-inflammatory actions, in ischemic stroke and Parkinson's disease models.
AIM OF THE STUDY: Previously, the ethanol extract of C. obtusifolia seeds (COE) was reported to have memory enhancing properties. However, the effects of COE in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) model are currently unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect(s) of COE on aberrant synaptic plasticity and memory impairment induced by amyloid β (Aβ), a key toxic component found in the AD brain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the effect of COE on Aβ-induced aberrant synaptic plasticity, we used acute mouse hippocampal slices and delivered theta burst stimulation to induce long-term potentiation (LTP). Western blots were used to detect Aβ- and/or COE-induced changes in signaling proteins. The novel object location recognition test was conducted to determine the effect of COE on Aβ-induced recognition memory impairment.
RESULTS: COE was found to ameliorate Aβ-induced LTP impairment in the acute hippocampal slices. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), a key molecule in LTP impairment, was activated by Aβ. However, this process was inhibited by COE via Akt signaling. Moreover, COE was found to attenuate Aβ-induced microglia, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase (COX) activation. In the in vivo studies performed, COE ameliorated the Aβ-induced object recognition memory impairment.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that COE exhibits neuroprotective activities against Aβ-induced brain disorders.},

Inhibition of microglia activation and reduction of major neurotoxic cytokines have been becoming a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. L-3-n-Butylphthalide (L-NBP) has shown the potent neuroprotective effects in stroke and Alzheimer's disease animal models. The present study investigated the immune modulatory effects of L-NBP on pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglia activation in brain tissue induced by systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment in C57BL/6 mice. Our results showed that systemic LPS treatment induced microglia activation in the brain. L-NBP treatment significantly suppressed the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), interlukin-1β (IL-1β), interlukin-6 (IL-6), and interlukin-10 (IL-10) in LPS-treated mice. At the meantime, L-NBP treatment decreased the morphological activation of microglia. In addition, the phosphorylation level of JNK MAP kinase-signaling pathway was also inhibited by L-NBP in LPS-treated mice. Furthermore, L-NBP upregulated the expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1, a key element in the anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress. These results suggested that L-NBP might be a promising candidate in delaying and reversing the progress of neurodegenerative diseases by inhibiting microglia activation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dark chocolate (DC) is abundant in flavanols which have been reported to increase the bioavailability and bioactivity of nitric oxide (NO). Increasing NO bioavailability has often demonstrated reduced oxygen cost and performance enhancement during submaximal exercise.
METHODS: Nine moderately-trained male participants volunteered to undertake baseline (BL) measurements that comprised a cycle V̇O(2max) test followed by cycling at 80\% of their established gas exchange threshold (GET) for 20-min and then immediately followed by a two-minute time-trial (TT). Using a randomised crossover design participants performed two further trials, two weeks apart, with either 40 g of DC or white chocolate (WC) being consumed daily. Oxygen consumption, RER, heart rate and blood lactate (BLa) were measured during each trial.
RESULTS: DC consumption increased GET and TT performance compared to both BL and WC (P {\textless} 0.05). DC consumption increased V̇O(2max) by 6\% compared to BL (P {\textless} 0.05), but did not reach statistical significance compared to WC. There were no differences in the moderate-intensity cycling for V̇O₂, RER, BLa and heart rate between conditions, although, V̇O₂ and RER exhibited consistently lower trends following DC consumption compared to BL and WC, these did not reach statistical significance.
CONCLUSION: Chronic supplementation with DC resulted in a higher GET and enhanced TT performance. Consequently, ingestion of DC reduced the oxygen cost of moderate intensity exercise and may be an effective ergogenic aid for short-duration moderate intensity exercise.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies reveal associations between intestinal ganglioside content and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since a low level of ganglioside is associated with higher production of proinflammatory signals in the intestine, it is important to determine safety and bioavailability of dietary ganglioside for application as a potential therapeutic agent.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy volunteers (HVs; n = 18) completed an 8-week supplementation study to demonstrate safety and bioavailabity of ganglioside consumption. HVs were randomized to consume a milk fat fraction containing 43 mg/d ganglioside or placebo, and patients with IBD (n = 5) consumed ganglioside supplement in a small pilot study. Plasma gangliosides were characterized using reverse-phase liquid chromatography-QQQ mass spectrometry. Intestinal permeability was assessed by oral lactulose/mannitol, and quality of life was assessed by quality of life in the IBD questionnaire.
RESULTS: There were no adverse events associated with dietary ganglioside intake. Ganglioside consumption increased ( P {\textless} .05) plasma content of total GD3 by 35\% over 8 weeks. HVs consuming ganglioside exhibited a 19\% decrease in intestinal permeability ( P = .04). Consumption of ganglioside was associated with a 39\% increase ( P {\textless} .01) in emotional health and a 36\% improvement ( P {\textless} .02) in systemic symptoms in patients with IBD.
CONCLUSION: Impaired intestinal integrity characteristic of IBD results in increased permeability to bacterial antigens and decreased nutrient absorption. Intestinal integrity may be improved by dietary treatment with specific species of ganglioside. Ganglioside is a safe, bioavailable dietary compound that can be consumed to potentially improve quality of life in patients with IBD and treat other disorders involving altered ganglioside metabolism.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circulating neopterin and the ratio of kynurenine to tryptophan (KYN/TRP) concentrations are biomarkers of immune activation that have been linked to cardiovascular and total mortality. Several in vitro studies indicated that tea flavonoids and other antioxidants can modulate tryptophan breakdown rates and neopterin production in immune cells. We aimed to assess the effects of regular black tea consumption on tryptophan and neopterin metabolisms in vivo.
METHODS: Participants were healthy individuals, with no major illnesses and having normal to mildly elevated systolic blood pressure. They were randomly assigned to consume 3 cups/day of either powdered black tea solids (tea; n = 45) or a flavonoid-free caffeine-matched beverage (control; n = 49). Serum concentrations of tryptophan, kynurenine and neopterin were assessed at baseline and again at 3 and 6 months after daily ingestion of the respective beverage.
RESULTS: Regular consumption of tea over 6 months, compared to control, did not significantly alter neopterin (p = 0.13) or tryptophan (p = 0.85) concentrations, but did result in significantly higher kynurenine (p = 0.016) and KYN/TRP (p = 0.012). Relative to the control group, in the tea group kynurenine and KYN/TRP increased during the treatment period by 0.28 μmol/L (95\% CI: - 0.04, 0.60) and 3.2 μmol/mmol (95\% CI: - 1.6, 8.0), respectively at 3 months, and by 0.48 μmol/L (95\% CI: 0.16, 0.80) and 7.5 μmol/mmol (95\% CI: 2.5, 12.5), respectively at 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased circulation of kynurenine and KYN/TRP following regular black tea consumption may indicate enhanced tryptophan breakdown, possibly due to immune activation-induced tryptophan degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The influence of black tea consumption on biomarkers of immune system activation could relate to its general health benefits. Data suggests that the net effect strongly depends on the individual immune state, being stimulatory in healthy individuals, while acting more immune dampening in situations with an inflammatory background.},

The open-label, two period, sequential study was conducted in 12 healthy human volunteers. A single dose of RSV 500 mg was administered once daily for 10 days during treatment phase. A single dose of CHZ 250 mg was administered during control and after treatment phases under fasting conditions. The blood samples were collected after CHZ dosing at predetermined time intervals and analyzed by HPLC. RSV pretreatment significantly enhanced the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC) and half life (T1/2) and significantly decreased elimination rate constant (Kel), apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of CHZ as compared to that of control. In addition, RSV pretreatment significantly decreased the metabolite to parent (6-OHCHZ/CHZ) ratios of Cmax, AUC and T1/2 and significantly increased the Kel ratio of 6-OHCHZ/CHZ, which indicated the reduced formation of CHZ to 6-OHCHZ. The results suggest that the altered CYP2E1 enzyme activity and pharmacokinetics of CHZ might be attributed to RSV mediated inhibition of CYP2E1 enzyme. Thus, there is a potential pharmacokinetic interaction between RSV and CHZ. The inhibition of CYP2E1 by RSV may provide a novel approach for minimizing the hepatotoxicity of ethanol.},

	abstract = {SCOPE: Increased consumption of fish oils rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is associated with improved cardiometabolic health and inflammatory status; however, age-related responses remain poorly described.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a placebo-controlled study, healthy young and older men consumed five fish oil capsules daily, providing 2.0 g/d EPA and 1.0g/d DHA, for three months. Both young and older men experienced a ∼30\% reduction in blood triglycerides with fish oil supplementation. A significant group × time interaction was observed for DHA, with young men experiencing a ∼twofold increase in DHA in serum and RBCs, while older men showed negligible increases. Other fatty acids were differentially regulated between young and older men, most notably osbond acid and several saturates. Small changes were observed in serum oxylipins, with both groups of men responding similarly: 5-HETE was reduced, while PGF2α and 17-HDoHE were increased. Changes in oxylipins occurred independent of changes in whole blood expression of key genes regulating oxylipin production.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that both young and older men experience the triglyceride-lowering benefits associated with fish oil supplements, but show differential responses in blood fatty acids. Additionally, fish oil promotes an improved oxylipin profile in both groups of men.},

Here we show that regular nutrient provision stabilizes exponential growth of E. coli, with the stationary phase occurring 20 min after nutrient supply accompanied by bacterial proteome changes, suggesting involvement of bacterial proteins in host satiety. Indeed, intestinal infusions of E. coli stationary phase proteins increased plasma PYY and their intraperitoneal injections suppressed acutely food intake and activated c-Fos in hypothalamic POMC neurons, while their repeated administrations reduced meal size. ClpB, a bacterial protein mimetic of α-MSH, was upregulated in the E. coli stationary phase, was detected in plasma proportional to ClpB DNA in feces, and stimulated firing rate of hypothalamic POMC neurons. Thus, these data show that bacterial proteins produced after nutrient-induced E. coli growth may signal meal termination. Furthermore, continuous exposure to E. coli proteins may influence long-term meal pattern.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hemodialysis (HD) per se entails vascular dysfunction in patients with ESRD. Endothelial dysfunction is a key step in atherosclerosis and is characterized by impaired flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Interventional studies have shown that cocoa flavanol (CF)-rich supplements improve vascular function. Aim of this study was to investigate the effect of flavanol-rich bioactive food ingredients on acute and chronic HD-induced vascular dysfunction in ESRD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, \& MEASUREMENTS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from 2012 to 2013. Fifty-seven participants were enrolled, ingested CF-rich beverages (900 mg CF per study day), and were compared with those ingesting CF-free placebo. This included (1) a baseline cross-over acute study to determine safety and efficacy of CF and (2) a subsequent chronic parallel group study with a 30-day follow-up period to study effects of CF on HD-mediated vascular dysfunction entailing (3) an acute substudy during HD in flavanol-naive patients and (4) an acute on chronic study during HD. Primary and secondary outcome measures included changes in FMD and hemodynamics.
RESULTS: CF ingestion was well tolerated. Acute ingestion improved FMD by 53\% (3.2±0.6\% to 4.8±0.9\% versus placebo, 3.2±0.7\% to 3.3±0.8\%; P{\textless}0.001), with no effects on BP or heart rate. A 30-day ingestion of CF led to an increase in baseline FMD by 18\% (3.4±0.9\% to 3.9±0.8\% versus placebo, 3.5±0.7\% to 3.5±0.7\%; P{\textless}0.001), with reduced diastolic BP (73±12 to 69±11 mmHg versus placebo, 70±11 to 73±13 mmHg; P=0.03) and increased heart rate (70±12 to 74±13 bpm versus placebo, 75±15 to 74±13 bpm; P=0.01). No effects were observed for placebo. Acute ingestion of CF during HD alleviated HD-induced vascular dysfunction (3.4±0.9\% to 2.7±0.6\% versus placebo, 3.5±0.7\% to 2.0±0.6\%; P{\textless}0.001). This effect was sustained throughout the study (acute on chronic, 3.9±0.9\% to 3.0±0.7\% versus placebo, 3.5±0.7\% to 2.2±0.6; P=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Dietary CF ingestion mitigates acute HD-induced and chronic endothelial dysfunction in patients with ESRD and thus, improves vascular function in this high-risk population. Larger clinical trials are warranted to test whether this translates into an improved cardiovascular prognosis in patients with ESRD.},

	abstract = {Reduced dietary protein intake and intermittent fasting (IF) are both linked to healthy longevity in rodents, and are effective in inhibiting cancer growth. The molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of chronic protein restriction (PR) and IF are unclear, but may be mediated in part by a down-regulation of the IGF/mTOR pathway. In this study we compared the effects of PR and IF on tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model of breast cancer. We also investigated the effects of PR and IF on the mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, inhibition of which extends lifespan in model organisms including mice. The mTOR protein kinase is found in two distinct complexes, of which mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is responsive to acute treatment with amino acids in cell culture and in vivo. We found that both PR and IF inhibit tumor growth and mTORC1 phosphorylation in tumor xenografts. In somatic tissues, we found that PR, but not IF, selectively inhibits the activity of the amino acid sensitive mTORC1, while the activity of the second mTOR complex, mTORC2, was relatively unaffected by PR. In contrast, IF resulted in increased S6 phosphorylation in multiple metabolic tissues. Our work represents the first finding that PR may reduce mTORC1 activity in tumors and multiple somatic tissues, and suggest that PR may represent a highly translatable option for the treatment not only of cancer, but also other age-related diseases.},

A structural analog of choline, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB), is shown to non-lethally inhibit TMA formation from cultured microbes, to inhibit distinct microbial TMA lyases, and to both inhibit TMA production from physiologic polymicrobial cultures (e.g., intestinal contents, human feces) and reduce TMAO levels in mice fed a high-choline or L-carnitine diet. DMB inhibited choline diet-enhanced endogenous macrophage foam cell formation and atherosclerotic lesion development in apolipoprotein e−/− mice without alterations in circulating cholesterol levels. The present studies suggest that targeting gut microbial production of TMA specifically and non-lethal microbial inhibitors in general may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases.},

We assessed whether consuming niacin-bound chromium (NBC) alone or in a formula containing other so-called "insulin sensitizers" would overcome various manifestations of aging and extend life span in Zucker Fatty Rats (ZFR). We compared many metabolic parameters of ZFR fed NBC alone (n=12) or NBC in a unique formula (n=10) to a control group (n=10). In addition to NBC, the formula contained Allium sativum, Momordica charantia, Trigonella foenum-graecum and Gymnema sylvestre. The formula group received roughly 1/2 as much NBC daily as the NBC group. At week 44, all rats still lived, and no abnormalities in blood count (CBC), renal, or liver functions were found. In the two treatment groups compared to control, circulating glucose levels were significantly lower, with a trend toward lower HbA1C. Relatively elevated cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations occurred in the formula group. Compared to control, the NBC group had increased average lifespan (21.8\%), median lifespan (14.1\%), 30th percentile survival (19.6\%), and maximum lifespan (22\%). Despite similar beneficial effects on the glucose and blood pressure systems, a difference in aging was also found when the NBC group was compared to the formula group. When all rats in the other two groups had died, four in the NBC group continued to live at least a month longer. We attribute lack of a similar aging effect in the formula group to either lower dosing of NBC and/or that various ingredients in the formula counteracted the antiaging effect(s) of NBC.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phosphorus status is inversely correlated with body weight; however, the effect of phosphorus supplementation on body weight in a controlled design has not been studied.
METHODS: This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 63 adults aged 18-45 years with a body mass index (BMI) of ⩾25 kg m(-2) and normal kidney function at the American University of Beirut. Participants were randomly assigned to the placebo or phosphorus group where daily placebo or phosphorus supplements were ingested with three main meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) for a period of 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were changes in anthropometric measures, blood metabolites (including lipid profile, glucose and insulin) and subjective appetite scores. The trial is registered with Clinical Trial.gov, NCT02329990.
RESULTS: Body weight was significantly lower in the phosphorus group when compared with the placebo group (-0.65 kg (95\% confidence interval (CI) -1.69 to 0.40) vs 1.13 kg (95\% CI 0.19 to 2.06), P=0.01). Similarly, BMI and waist circumference were significantly lower in the phosphorus group when compared with the placebo group (-0.24 kg m(-2) (95\% CI -0.59 to 0.12) vs 0.42 kg m(-2) (95\% CI 0.05 to 0.78), P=0.01; -3.62 cm (95\% CI-4.90 to -2.33) vs 0.38 cm ( 95\% CI-0.44 to 1.20), P{\textless}0.001; respectively). Several parameters of subjective appetite scores were decreased in the phosphorus-supplemented group.
CONCLUSIONS: Phosphorus supplementation for 12 weeks significantly decreases body weight, BMI, waist circumference and subjective appetite scores. These findings support a promising role of the mineral phosphorus in the prevention and management of obesity, especially abdominal adiposity. The exact mechanisms of action and longer-term effects still need to be elucidated.},

Conjugates of p-coumaric acid have been extensively studied in recent years due to their bioactivities. In this review, the occurrence, bioavailability and bioaccessibility of p-coumaric acid and its conjugates with mono-, oligo- and polysaccharides, alkyl alcohols, organic acids, amine and lignin are discussed. Their biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-cancer, antimicrobial, antivirus, anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet aggregation, anxiolytic, antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-arthritis activities, and their mitigatory effects against diabetes, obesity, hyperlipaemia and gout are compared. Cumulative evidence from multiple studies indicates that conjugation of p-coumaric acid greatly strengthens its biological activities; however, the high biological activity but low absorption of its conjugates remains a puzzle.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Middle-aged C57Bl/6J mice fed for 6 months with extra-virgin olive oil rich in phenols (H-EVOO, phenol dose/day: 6 mg/kg) showed cognitive and motor improvement compared to controls fed the same olive oil deprived of phenolics (L-EVOO). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether these behavioral modifications were associated with changes in gene and miRNA expression in the brain.
METHODS: Two brain areas involved in cognitive and motor processes were chosen: cortex and cerebellum. Gene and miRNA profiling were analyzed by microarray and correlated with performance in behavioral tests.
RESULTS: After 6 months, most of the gene expression changes were restricted to the cerebral cortex. The genes modulated by aging were mainly down-regulated, and the treatment with H-EVOO was associated with a significant up-regulation of genes compared to L-EVOO. Among those, we found genes previously associated with synaptic plasticity and with motor and cognitive behavior, such as Notch1, BMPs, NGFR, GLP1R and CRTC3. The agrin pathway was also significantly modulated. miRNAs were mostly up-regulated in old L-EVOO animals compared to young. However, H-EVOO-fed mice cortex displayed miRNA expression profiles similar to those observed in young mice. Sixty-three miRNAs, out of 1203 analyzed, were significantly down-regulated compared to the L-EVOO group; among them, we found miRNAs whose predicted target genes were up-regulated by the treatment, such as mir-484, mir-27, mir-137, mir-30, mir-34 and mir-124.
CONCLUSIONS: We are among the first to report that a dietary intervention starting from middle age with food rich in phenols can modulate at the central level the expression of genes and miRNAs involved in neuronal function and synaptic plasticity, along with cognitive, motor and emotional behavior.},

Sulforaphane is difficult to deliver in an enriched and stable form for purposes of direct human consumption. We have focused upon evaluating the bioavailability of sulforaphane, either by direct administration of glucoraphanin (a glucosinolate, or Î²-thioglucoside-N-hydroxysulfate), or by co-administering glucoraphanin and the enzyme myrosinase to catalyze its conversion to sulforaphane at economic, reproducible and sustainable yields. We show that following administration of glucoraphanin in a commercially prepared dietary supplement to a small number of human volunteers, the volunteers had equivalent output of sulforaphane metabolites in their urine to that which they produced when given an equimolar dose of glucoraphanin in a simple boiled and lyophilized extract of broccoli sprouts. Furthermore, when either broccoli sprouts or seeds are administered directly to subjects without prior extraction and consequent inactivation of endogenous myrosinase, regardless of the delivery matrix or dose, the sulforaphane in those preparations is 3- to 4-fold more bioavailable than sulforaphane from glucoraphanin delivered without active plant myrosinase. These data expand upon earlier reports of inter- and intra-individual variability, when glucoraphanin was delivered in either teas, juices, or gelatin capsules, and they confirm that a variety of delivery matrices may be equally suitable for glucoraphanin supplementation (e.g. fruit juices, water, or various types of capsules and tablets).},

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether Fisetin was capable of enhancing cytotoxicity of Cisplatin in Cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells, and explore the possible signaling pathways involved. Cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells, A549-CR, was established by repeated subculturing of A549 cells with increasing Cisplatin. Proliferation ability was assessed by MTT analysis and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The results showed that Fisetin effectively increased sensitivity of A549-CR cells to Cisplatin, possibly mediated by inhibiting aberrant activation of MAPK signaling pathways.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Indoles, including indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and its derivatives, are the products of glucosinolate hydrolysis catalyzed by the enzyme myrosinase. Under acidic conditions, I3C polymerizes into 3, 3- diindolylmethane (DIM), [2-(indol-3-ylmethyl)-indol-3-yl]indol-3-ylmethane (LTr1), 1-(3-hydroxymethyl)- indolyl-3-indolylmethane (HI-IM) and indolo[3,2b]carbazole (ICZ). Recently, I3C and its dimer DIM have shown pleiotropic protective effects on chronic liver injuries, including viral hepatitis, hepatic steatosis, hepatic cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and so on.
METHODS: We reviewed the published papers about the pharmacokinetics of I3C and its derivatives in vitro and in vivo, and summarized their multiple protective roles in the processes of chronic liver diseases.
RESULTS: Indoles not only regulate transcriptional factors and their respective signaling pathways, but also relieve oxidative stress and inhibit the synthesis of DNA to influence the activation, proliferation and apoptosis of target cells. Moreover, indoles modulate the enzymes that are relevant to hepatitis viral replication, lipogenesis, and the metabolism of ethanol and some hepatotoxic substances to protect the liver. Currently, the immunomodulatory biofunction of indoles contributes to improving non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In addition, indoles also function as the inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to reduce microbial-induced liver injures.
CONCLUSION: Indoles, especially I3C and DIM as phytochemicals, exert anti-fibrosis, anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, immunomodulatory, detoxification and anti-inflammation effects on hepatic protection through pleiotropic mechanism.},

However, translational clinical trials evaluating the ability of BRB phytochemicals to impact molecular biomarkers in the oral mucosa remain limited. The present phase 0 study addresses a fundamental question for oral cancer food-based prevention: Do BRB phytochemicals successfully reach the targeted oral tissues and reduce proinflammatory and antiapoptotic gene expression profiles? Patients with biopsy-confirmed oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) administered oral troches containing freeze-dried BRB powder from the time of enrollment to the date of curative intent surgery (13.9 Â± 1.27 days). Transcriptional biomarkers were evaluated in patient-matched OSCCs and noninvolved high at-risk mucosa (HARM) for BRB-associated changes. Significant expression differences between baseline OSCC and HARM tissues were confirmed using a panel of genes commonly deregulated during oral carcinogenesis. Following BRB troche administration, the expression of prosurvival genes (AURKA, BIRC5, EGFR) and proinflammatory genes (NFKB1, PTGS2) were significantly reduced. There were no BRB-associated grade 3-4 toxicities or adverse events, and 79.2\% (N = 30) of patients successfully completed the study with high levels of compliance (97.2\%). The BRB phytochemicals cyanidin-3-rutinoside and cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside were detected in all OSCC tissues analyzed, demonstrating that bioactive components were successfully reaching targeted OSCC tissues. We confirmed that hallmark antiapoptotic and proinflammatory molecular biomarkers were overexpressed in OSCCs and that their gene expression was significantly reduced following BRB troche administration. As these molecular biomarkers are fundamental to oral carcinogenesis and are modifiable, they may represent emerging biomarkers of molecular efficacy for BRB-mediated oral cancer chemoprevention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: New therapies are being explored as therapeutic options for men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (BRPC) who wish to defer androgen deprivation therapy. MPX is pulverized muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia) skin that contains ellagic acid, quercetin, and resveratrol and demonstrates preclinical activity against prostate cancer cells in vitro.
METHODS: In the phase I portion of this phase I/II study, non-metastatic BRPC patients were assigned to increasing doses of MPX (Muscadine Naturals. Inc., Clemmons, NC) in cohorts of two patients, with six patients at the highest dose, using a modified continual reassessment method. Initial dose selection was based on preclinical data showing the equivalent of 500 to 4,000 mg of MPX to be safe in mouse models. The primary endpoint was the recommended phase II dosing regimen.
RESULTS: The cohort (n = 14, 71\% Caucasian, 29\% black) had a median follow-up of 19.2 (6.2-29.7) months, median age of 61 years, and median Gleason score of 7. Four patients had possibly related gastrointestinal symptoms, including grade 1 flatulence, grade 1 soft stools, and grade 1 eructation. No other related adverse events were reported and one patient reported improvement of chronic constipation. Six of 14 patients came off study for disease progression (five metastatic, one rising PSA) after exposure for a median of 15 months. One patient came off for myasthenia gravis that was unrelated to treatment. Seven patients remain on study. The lack of dose-limiting toxicities led to the selection of 4,000 mg/d as the highest dose for further study. Median within-patient PSADT increased by 5.3 months (non-significant, P = 0.17). No patients experienced a maintained decline in serum PSA from baseline.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that 4,000 mg of MPX is safe, and exploratory review of a lengthening in PSADT of a median of 5.3 months supports further exploration of MPX. Both low-dose (500 mg) and high-dose (4,000 mg) MPX are being further investigated in a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-evaluating phase II trial.},

METHODS: In a randomized, single-blind, diet-controlled crossover study, 12 healthy subjects (six men and six women) aged 21-33 years were administered a single oral supra-nutritional dose of approximately 163 mg quercetin derived from onion skin extract powder (containing 95.3 \% of total flavonoids as quercetin aglycone) or quercetin dihydrate (134 mg quercetin aglycone equivalent). Blood samples were collected before and during a 24-h period after quercetin administration. The concentrations of quercetin and its two monomethylated derivatives, isorhamnetin (3'-O-methyl quercetin), and tamarixetin (4'-O-methyl quercetin), were measured using HPLC with fluorescence detection after plasma enzymatic treatment.
RESULTS: The systemic availability, determined by comparing the plasma concentration-time curves of quercetin, was 4.8 times higher, and the maximum plasma concentration (C max) was 5.4 times higher after ingestion of the onion skin extract than after ingestion of pure quercetin dihydrate. By contrast, t max did not differ significantly between the two formulations. The C max values for isorhamnetin and tamarixetin were 3.8 and 4.4 times higher, respectively, after administration of onion skin extract than after pure quercetin dihydrate. The plasma kinetics of quercetin were not significantly different in men and women.
CONCLUSION: Quercetin aglycone derived from onion skin extract powder is significantly more bioavailable than that from quercetin dihydrate powder filled hard capsules.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated the protective effects of cocoa consumption, due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Acute exercise induces oxidative stress and causes muscular damage during training. This study was designed to examine the effect of cocoa consumption on the markers of muscle damage, oxidative stress and physical fitness in professional soccer players.
METHODS: Fifteen players (15-18 years old) were included in the study. Biochemical parameters, markers of muscle damage and oxidative stress, and physical performance were evaluated before and after cocoa consumption. Biochemical parameters determined the healthy metabolic status of the study group; biomarkers of muscle and oxidative damage were measured in blood to establish muscle and redox status.
RESULTS: However, high levels of biomarkers of muscle damage were detected. Interestingly, cocoa consumption decreased the muscle damage biomarkers of CK and LDH by 39.4\% and 23.03\%, respectively. The redox status was modified by a decrease in oxidative damage (carbonyl groups, 26.31\%; thiol groups, 27.52\%; MDA, 32.42\%) and an increase in total antioxidant capacity (15.98\%) and GSH-Px activity (26.37\%). In addition, we observed an increase in physical performance by 4\% in the Cooper Test.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a short period of cocoa consumption could be useful in maintaining a good physical fitness, due to the favourable effects on muscle and redox status in athletes during exhaustive exercise.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of hydrogen-1 nuclei ((1)H NMR S) to analyze the metabolic profile of reflex tears from patients with dry eye disorders.
METHODS: We performed a prospective case-control study involving 90 participants: 55 patients diagnosed with dry eye syndrome (DESG) and 35 healthy subjects (control group, CG). From the DESG, two subgroups were formed: mild DES (n=22) and moderate DES (n=33). Participants were prescribed an oral nutraceutic supplementation containing antioxidants and essential polyunsaturated fatty acids to be taken as three capsules per day for 3 months. Reflex tears (20-30 µl) were collected from the tear meniscus of both eyes of each subject with a microglass pipette. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were acquired with a standard one-dimensional pulse sequence with water suppression; 256 free induction decays were collected into 64,000 data points with 14 ppm spectral width.
RESULTS: Basal tears showed a differential metabolomic profile between groups. Almost 50 metabolites were identified by H cholesterol, N-acetylglucosamine, glutamate, amino-n-butyrate, choline, glucose, and formate were detected before supplementation and choline/acetylcholine after supplementation. The metabolic profile of the tears was statistically different between groups, as well as before and after supplementation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that DES induces changes in the tear metabolic profile that can be modified with appropriate oral supplementation with antioxidants and essential polyunsaturated fatty acids.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Age-associated declines in muscle mass and function are major risk factors for an impaired ability to carry out activities of daily living, falls, prolonged recovery time after hospitalization, and mortality in older adults. New strategies that can slow the age-related loss of muscle mass and function are needed to help older adults maintain adequate performance status to reduce these risks and maintain independence.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the efficacy of fish oil-derived n-3 (Ï‰-3) PUFA therapy to slow the age-associated loss of muscle mass and function.
DESIGN: Sixty healthy 60-85-y-old men and women were randomly assigned to receive n-3 PUFA (n = 40) or corn oil (n = 20) therapy for 6 mo. Thigh muscle volume, handgrip strength, one-repetition maximum (1-RM) lower- and upper-body strength, and average power during isokinetic leg exercises were evaluated before and after treatment.
RESULTS: Forty-four subjects completed the study [29 subjects (73\%) in the n-3 PUFA group; 15 subjects (75\%) in the control group]. Compared with the control group, 6 mo of n-3 PUFA therapy increased thigh muscle volume (3.6\%; 95\% CI: 0.2\%, 7.0\%), handgrip strength (2.3 kg; 95\% CI: 0.8, 3.7 kg), and 1-RM muscle strength (4.0\%; 95\% CI: 0.8\%, 7.3\%) (all P {\textless} 0.05) and tended to increase average isokinetic power (5.6\%; 95\% CI: -0.6\%, 11.7\%; P = 0.075).
CONCLUSION: Fish oil-derived n-3 PUFA therapy slows the normal decline in muscle mass and function in older adults and should be considered a therapeutic approach for preventing sarcopenia and maintaining physical independence in older adults.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is evidence that renal transplant recipients have accelerated atherosclerosis that is manifest by increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The high incidence of atherosclerosis is, in part, related to increased arterial stiffness, vascular dysfunction, elevated oxidative stress, and inflammation associated with immunosuppressive therapy. The carotenoid astaxanthin has shown potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the effects of oral astaxanthin on arterial stiffness, oxidative stress, and inflammation in renal transplant recipients.
DESIGN: This trial used a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design in which 61 patients received either 12 mg astaxanthin/d or an identical placebo orally for 1 y. Primary outcomes were 1) arterial stiffness measured by aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), 2) oxidative stress assessed by total plasma F2-isoprostanes, and 3) inflammation assessed by plasma pentraxin-3. Secondary outcomes included vascular function, carotid artery intima-media thickness, augmentation index, central blood pressure, subendocardial viability ratio, and additional measures of oxidative stress and inflammation. Patients underwent assessments at baseline and at 6 and 12 mo.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight participants completed the study. There were no significant between-group differences in the changes in any of the primary outcome measures (PWV changed by +9.5\% and +6.0\%, F2-isoprostanes changed by -3.0\% and -9.7\%, and pentraxin-3 changed by +50.6\% and -11.0\% in the placebo and astaxanthin groups, respectively). There were no significant between-group differences in secondary outcome measures. Larger-than-expected variability decreased the power of the study and increased the possibility of a type 2 statistical error.
CONCLUSION: Astaxanthin (12 mg/d for 12 mo) had no effect on arterial stiffness, oxidative stress, or inflammation in renal transplant recipients. This trial was registered at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (http://www.anzctr.org.au/) as ACTRN12608000159358.},

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two dietary groups (n = 6 in each group): a high-cholesterol diet containing 0.5\% cholesterol and 0.15\% sodium cholate, and a high-cholesterol diet with 5\% (w/w) taurine. The experimental diets were given for 2 weeks. Taurine supplementation reduced the serum and hepatic cholesterol levels by 37\% and 32\%, respectively. Faecal excretion of bile acids was significantly increased in taurine-treated rats, compared with untreated rats. Biliary bile acid concentrations were also increased by taurine. Taurine supplementation increased taurine-conjugated bile acids by 61\% and decreased glycine-conjugated bile acids by 53\%, resulting in a significant decrease in the glycine/taurine (G/T) ratio. Among the taurine-conjugated bile acids, cholic acid and deoxycholic acid were significantly increased. In the liver, taurine supplementation increased the mRNA expression and enzymatic activity of hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis, by three- and two-fold, respectively. Taurine also decreased the enzymatic activity of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). These observations suggest that taurine supplementation increases the synthesis and excretion of taurine-conjugated bile acids and stimulates the catabolism of cholesterol to bile acid by elevating the expression and activity of CYP7A1. This may reduce cholesterol esterification and lipoprotein assembly for very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, leading to reductions in the serum and hepatic cholesterol levels.},

	abstract = {Silymarin, a characterized extract of the seeds of milk thistle (Silybum marianum), suppresses cellular inflammation. To define how this occurs, transcriptional profiling, metabolomics, and signaling studies were performed in human liver and T cell lines. Cellular stress and metabolic pathways were modulated within 4 h of silymarin treatment: activation of Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF-4) and adenosine monophosphate protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, the latter being associated with induction of DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4). Metabolomics analyses revealed silymarin suppression of glycolytic, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and amino acid metabolism. Anti-inflammatory effects arose with prolonged (i.e., 24 h) silymarin exposure, with suppression of multiple pro-inflammatory mRNAs and signaling pathways including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and forkhead box O (FOXO). Studies with murine knock out cells revealed that silymarin inhibition of both mTOR and NF-κB was partially AMPK dependent, whereas silymarin inhibition of mTOR required DDIT4. Other natural products induced similar stress responses, which correlated with their ability to suppress inflammation. Thus, natural products activate stress and repair responses that culminate in an anti-inflammatory cellular phenotype. Natural products like silymarin may be useful as tools to define how metabolic, stress, and repair pathways regulate cellular inflammation.},

The present study was performed to investigate the protective effects of an ethanolic extract of F. mume on the inflammatory response and cholinergic dysfunction in a model of CCH induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAo) in Wistar rats. Rats were assigned to three treatment groups: sham plus vehicle, BCCAo plus vehicle, and BCCAo plus F. mume extract (200â€‰mg/kg). F. mume was administered by oral gavage from days 21 to 42 following BCCAo. Glial cell numbers were measured in the white matter and hippocampus. The hippocampal expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, angiotensin-II (Ang-II), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) were also evaluated. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) levels in the hippocampus and basal forebrain were examined. Rats with BCCAo showed an increase in the number of glial cells and levels of proinflammatory cytokines, Ang-II, RAGE, and MAPKs, all of which were significantly attenuated by F. mume treatment. F. mume administration also restored ChAT expression in the basal forebrain and hippocampus following chronic BCCAo. These results suggest that F. mume is a potentially valuable drug or nutraceutical for the treatment of VaD.},

The primary aim of this study was to assess whether dietary glutamic acid intake was associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in community-dwelling adults. A secondary aim was to evaluate whether the association could be modified by the body mass index (BMI).
METHODS: This study was embedded in the Rotterdam study, which included a prospective cohort from 1990 onward that consisted of 5362 subjects who were 55 years old or older and were free of CRC at the baseline. Glutamic acid was calculated as a percentage of the total protein intake with a validated food frequency questionnaire at the baseline. Incident cases of CRC were pathology-based.
RESULTS: During follow-up, 242 subjects developed CRC. Baseline dietary glutamic acid intake was significantly associated with a lower risk of developing CRC (hazard ratio [HR] per percent increase in glutamic acid of protein, 0.78; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-0.99). After stratification for BMI, the risk reduction for CRC by dietary glutamic acid was 42\% for participants with a BMI â‰¤ 25 kg/m(2) (HR per percent increase in glutamic acid of protein, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.40-0.85), whereas no association was found in participants with a BMI {\textgreater} 25 kg/m(2) (HR per percent increase in glutamic acid of protein, 0.97; 95\% CI, 0.73-1.31).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that baseline dietary glutamic acid intake is associated with a lower risk of developing CRC, but this association may be mainly present in nonoverweight subjects.},

Lately, the attention has been brought to vegetables with high nitrate content with evidence that this might represent a source of vasoprotective nitric oxide. We hypothesized that short-term consumption of spinach, a vegetable having high dietary nitrate content, can affect the arterial waveform indicative of arterial stiffness, as well as central and peripheral blood pressure (BP). Using a placebo-controlled, crossover design, 27 healthy participants were randomly assigned to receive either a high-nitrate (spinach; 845 mg nitrate/day) or low-nitrate soup (asparagus; 0.6 mg nitrate/day) for 7 days with a 1-week washout period. On days 1 and 7, profiles of augmentation index, central, and brachial BP were obtained over 180 min post-consumption in 4 fasted visits. A postprandial reduction in augmentation index was observed at 180 min on high-nitrate compared to low-nitrate intervention (-6.54 ± 9.7\% vs. -0.82 ± 8.0\%, p = 0.01) on Day 1, and from baseline on Day 7 (-6.93 ± 8.7\%, p {\textless} 0.001; high vs. low: -2.28 ± 12.5\%, p = 0.35), suggesting that the nitrate intervention is not associated with the development of tolerance for at least 7 days of continued supplementation.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: It has been shown that lutein and zeaxanthin accumulate in the macula where they enhance contrast sensitivity and may reduce the risk of progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Furthermore, omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) might further reduce this risk. However, controversy exists regarding whether PUFA may reduce the bioavailability of lutein.
METHODS: This was a prospective 12-month, randomized, open label study evaluating the effect of supplementation with lutein, other antioxidants, and minerals on contrast sensitivity (CS) and macular pigment optical density (MPOD) in patients with age-related maculopathy. A total of 79 patients were randomized to either lutein (10 mg) and antioxidant supplement or lutein and antioxidant supplement in combination with PUFA. Patients received supplementation for a period of 6 months and were followed for a total of 12 months.
RESULTS: Serum lutein and zeaxanthin increased significantly by the first follow-up visit at 1 month, and remained elevated throughout the intervention period of 6 months in the lutein-only group but not in the lutein+PUFA group. Macular pigment optical density and CS increased significantly in the lutein-only group (P {\textless} 0.005) but not in the lutein+PUFA group (P = 0.059) compared to baseline. Best-corrected visual acuity remained unchanged during the entire study period in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Addition of PUFA may reduce the bioavailability of lutein and therefore lessen the beneficial effect on macular pigment and CS. This needs to be considered when prescribing lutein supplements to patients with low lutein levels. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00563979.).},

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine whether leucine, a stimulator of translation initiation and skeletal muscle protein synthesis (MPS), can protect skeletal muscle health during bed rest.
DESIGN: We used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess changes in skeletal MPS, cellular signaling, body composition, and skeletal muscle function in middle-aged adults (n = 19; age ± SEM: 52 ± 1 y) in response to leucine supplementation (LEU group: 0.06 g ∙ kg(-1) ∙ meal(-1)) or an alanine control (CON group) during 14 d of bed rest.
RESULTS: Bed rest decreased postabsorptive MPS by 30\% ± 9\% (CON group) and by 10\% ± 10\% (LEU group) (main effect for time, P {\textless} 0.05), but no differences between groups with respect to pre-post changes (group × time interactions) were detected for MPS or cell signaling. Leucine protected knee extensor peak torque (CON compared with LEU group: -15\% ± 2\% and -7\% ± 3\%; group × time interaction, P {\textless} 0.05) and endurance (CON compared with LEU: -14\% ± 3\% and -2\% ± 4\%; group × time interaction, P {\textless} 0.05), prevented an increase in body fat percentage (group × time interaction, P {\textless} 0.05), and reduced whole-body lean mass loss after 7 d (CON compared with LEU: -1.5 ± 0.3 and -0.8 ± 0.3 kg; group × time interaction, P {\textless} 0.05) but not 14 d (CON compared with LEU: -1.5 ± 0.3 and -1.0 ± 0.3 kg) of bed rest.

	abstract = {With increasingly serious eye exposure to light stresses, such as light-emitting diodes, computers, and widescreen mobile phones, efficient natural compounds for preventing visible light-induced retinal damages are becoming compelling needs in the modern society. Fucoxanthin, as the main light absorption system in marine algae, may possess an outstanding bioactivity in vision protection because of its filtration of blue light and excellent antioxidative activity. In this work, both in vitro and in vivo simulated visible light-induced retinal damage models were employed. The in vitro results revealed that fucoxanthin exhibited better bioactivities than lutein, zeaxanthin, and blueberry anthocyanins in inhibiting overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor, resisting senescence, improving phagocytic function, and clearing intracellular reactive oxygen species in retinal pigment epithelium cells. The in vivo experiment also confirmed the superiority of fucoxanthin than lutein in protecting retina against photoinduced damage. This excellent bioactivity may be attributed to its unique structural features, including allenic, epoxide, and acetyl groups. Fucoxanthin is expected to be an important ocular nutrient in the future.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the nutritional supplements Pycnogenol® and Centella asiatica (CA) on atherosclerosis progression in low-risk, asymptomatic subjects with carotid or femoral stenosing plaques.
METHODS: The study included subjects aged 45-60 with stenosing atherosclerotic plaques (50-60\%) in at least one carotid or common femoral bifurcation. Subjects were allocated into 3 groups. In Group 1 (controls), management was based on education, exercise, diet and lifestyle changes. This same management plan was used in the other two groups: Group 2 used Pycnogenol® (100 mg/day), while Group 3 used Pycnogenol® 100 mg/day plus CA (100 mg/day). The follow-up lasted 4 years. Plaque progression was assessed using the ultrasonic arterial score based on arterial wall morphology, considering plaque characteristics and the number of subjects that had cardiovascular events. Oxidative stress was also measured.
RESULTS: Of the 413 individuals that were admitted, 391 individuals completed 4 years. Group distribution was comparable. The rate of progression of ultrasound arterial score was significantly lower in the two supplement groups (P{\textless}0.05) in comparison with controls suggesting a beneficial effect of Pycnogenol® with a significant difference in favor of the combination (P{\textless}0.05). There was a reduction in plaques progression in the supplement groups with the best effects obtained by the combination, considering maximum plaque thickness and length and echogenicity (grey scale median) (P{\textless}0.05). Plaques became generally dense (more echogenic) achieving a mixed echogenicity. The occurrence of anginal events was less than 3\% in the two supplement groups (in comparison with 6.25\% in controls) (P{\textless}0.05) with the best results obtained by the combination (P{\textless}0.05). The occurrence in myocardial infarctions was significantly lower for the combination (P{\textless}0.05). Minor transient ischemic attacks were also less frequent with the supplements with the best results observed with the combination (P{\textless}0.05). Events in controls - requiring hospital admission - were globally seen in 16.4\% of subjects (minor events) in comparison with 8.9\% of subjects using Pycnogenol® and only 3.3\% of patients using the combination. At 4 years, oxidative stress in the supplement groups was lower than in controls (P{\textless}0.05, with no significant difference between groups 2 and 3).
CONCLUSIONS: Pycnogenol® and the combination of Pycnogenol® plus CA reduce the progression of arterial plaques and the progression to clinical stages. The reduction in plaques and clinical progression was associated with a reduction in oxidative stress. The results justify a larger study to define the efficacy of the combination of Pycnogenol® plus CA as a prophylaxis in preclinical atherosclerosis.},

The proliferation of cancer cells was examined by using the Cell Counting Kit-8. The clonogenic growth potential was determined by clonogenic assay. Cell cycle distribution was evaluated by flow cytometry using propidium iodide staining. Western blot analysis was applied to explore the expression patterns of molecules associated with apoptotic cell death and cell cycle checkpoint. We noted that Theracurmin® and curcumin exhibited similar anticancer effects in both androgen-dependent and -independent human prostate cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These agents reduced cell viability and clonogenic growth potential by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle disturbance in human prostate cancer cells. Theracurmin® and curcumin also exerted marked anticancer effects on human bladder cancer cells, even in cisplatin-resistant T24R2 cells, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, Theracurmin® and curcumin treatment decreased cell viability and clonogenicity via induction of apoptotic cell death and cell cycle dysregulation in human bladder cancer cells. In conclusion, our study suggests that Theracurmin® has potential as an anticancer agent in complementary and alternative medicine for these urological cancers.},

	abstract = {Methylglyoxal (MGO)-induced carbonyl stress and pro-inflammatory responses have been suggested to contribute to endothelial dysfunction. Curcumin (Cur), a polyphenolic compound from Curcuma longa L., may protect endothelial cells against carbonyl stress-induced damage by trapping dicarbonyl compounds such as MGO. However, Cur-MGO adducts have not been studied in depth to date and it remains to be known whether Cur-MGO adducts are able to attenuate endothelial damage by trapping MGO. In the present study, 1,2-diaminobenzene was reacted with MGO to ensure the reliability of the reaction system. Cur was demonstrated to trap MGO at a 1:1 ratio to form adducts 1, 2 and 3 within 720 min. The structures of these adducts were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The kinetic curves of Cur (10(-7), 10(-6) and 10(-5) M) were measured from 0-168 h by fluorescent intensity. Cur significantly inhibited the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The differences in oxidative damage and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines following MGO + HSA or Cur-MGO treatment were investigated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Exposure of HUVECs to the Cur-MGO reaction adducts significantly reduced the intracellular ROS levels and improved cell viability compared with MGO alone. Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the expression levels of transforming growth factor-Î²1 and intercellular adhesion molecule(-1) following treatment with Cur-MGO adducts compared with MGO alone. These results provide further evidence that the trapping of MGO by Cur inhibits the formation of AGEs. The current study indicates that the protective effect of Cur on carbonyl stress and pro-inflammatory responses in endothelial damage occurs via the trapping of MGO.},

Before and after RE treatment, the study evaluated fasting serum levels of plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), inter-cellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), fibrinogen, high-sensitivity capsular reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor-necrosis factor α (TNF-α), the lipid profile and ED, characterized as flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in the brachial artery of {\textless} 4.5\%, estimated by ultrasound measurements. After 21 days, any side effects were registered, the mean FMD increased nonsignificantly (6.51 ± 5.96\% vs 7.78 ± 4.56\%, p = 0.546) and ED decreased significantly (66.6\% vs 16.6\%, p = 0.040). Among the serum markers, only the mean PAI-1 level decreased significantly (4.25 ± 1.46 U/mL vs 3.0 ± 0.61 U/mL, p = 0.012) after 21-day RE supplementation.

	abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that depression is accompanied by dysregulation of neuroimmune system. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural compound with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. The present study aims to investigate the effects of SFN on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors as well as potential neuroimmune mechanisms in mice. Repeated SFN administration (10mg/kg, i.p.) significantly decreased the immobility time in the forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), and latency time to feeding in the novelty suppressed feeding test (NSF), and increased the time in the central zone in the open field test (OPT). Using the chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm, we confirmed that repeated SFN (10mg/kg, i.p.) administration significantly increased sucrose preference in the sucrose preference test (SPT), and immobility time in the FST and TST of mice subjected to CMS. Also, SFN treatment significantly reversed anxiety-like behaviors (assessed by the OPT and NSF) of chronically stressed mice. Finally, ELISA analysis showed that SFN administration blocked the increase in the serum levels of corticosterone (CORT), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in chronically stressed mice. In summary, these findings demonstrated that SFN has antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like activities in stressed mice model of depression, which likely occurs by inhibiting the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and inflammatory response to stress. These data support further exploration for developing SFN as a novel agent to treat depression and anxiety disorders.},

METHODS: Male wistar rats age 4 and 18 months were randomized into control and experimental groups. A single daily dose of 50 mg/kg of olive leaf extract was administered orally by gavage to each rat for 6 months. The control group received only distilled water. All rats were sacrificed 2 hours after the last gavage and their midbrains were separated for Malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant enzyme activitiy analysis. TUNEL assay and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were used for evaluation of the number of neurons in the Substantia Nigra.
RESULTS: The level of Catalase, Glutathione Peroxidase and Superoxide Dismutase enzyme activity were significantly increased in experimental young and old groups compared to their control groups. However the level of Superoxide Dismutase enzyme activity was significantly increased in experimental old group when compared to control group (P{\textless} 0.05), the level of Superoxide Dismutase enzyme activity was not significantly changed in young groups. MDA level was decreased significantly in experimental young and old rats compared to their control groups. Histological analysis demonstrated that the number of neurons in Substantia Nigra of experimental old group was more than the control group (P{\textless}0.05). The number of apoptotic cells was significantly decreased in experimental old group compared to the corresponding control group (P{\textless}0.05). In IHC and TUNEL assay, no change was observed in the number of neurons between experimental and control young groups.
CONCLUSION: Long term treatment with olive leaf extract increases antioxidant enzyme activity and protects the neurons in Substantia Nigra against oxidative stress.},

Uridine (100 μM) was found to increase the percentage of neurite-bearing cells of differentiating neuroblastoma (N2a) cells by 43.1 ± 0.5\%, which was 1.8-fold higher than NGF (50 ng/mL)-treated cells. Uridine which was present in P. giganteus (1.80 ± 0.03 g/100g mushroom extract) increased the phosphorylation of extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERKs) and protein kinase B (Akt). Further, phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was also increased. MEK/ERK and PI3K-Akt-mTOR further induced phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and expression of growth associated protein 43 (GAP43); all of which promoted neurite outgrowth of N2a cells. This study demonstrated that P. giganteus may enhance neurite outgrowth and one of the key bioactive molecules responsible for neurite outgrowth is uridine.},

We repeatedly screened to find an effective food to treat obesity and discovered that rosehip extract shows potent anti-obesity effects. Investigations in mice have demonstrated that rosehip extract inhibits body weight gain and decreases visceral fat. Thus, the present study examined the effect of rosehip extract on human body fat in preobese subjects.
METHODS: We conducted a 12-week, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 32 subjects who had a body mass index of â‰¥25 but {\textless}30. The subjects were assigned to two random groups, and they received one tablet of placebo or rosehip that contained 100 mg of rosehip extract once each day for 12 weeks with no dietary intervention. Abdominal fat area and body fat percent were measured as primary outcomes. The other outcomes were body weight and body mass index.
RESULTS: Abdominal total fat area, abdominal visceral fat area, body weight, and body mass index decreased significantly in the rosehip group at week 12 compared with their baseline levels (P{\textless}0.01) after receiving the rosehip tablet intake, and the decreases in these parameters were significantly higher when compared with those in the placebo group. Additionally, body fat percent tended to decrease compared with the placebo group and their baseline level. Moreover, the abdominal subcutaneous fat area was significantly lower in the rosehip group than in the placebo group at week 12 after the initiation of intake (P{\textless}0.05). In addition, there were no abnormalities, subjective symptoms, and findings that may indicate clinical problems during the study period.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that rosehip extract may be a good candidate food material for preventing obesity.},

	abstract = {Mediterranean diet includes a relatively high fat consumption mostly from monounsaturated fatty acids mainly provided by olive oil, the principal source of culinary and dressing fat. The beneficial effects of olive oil have been widely studied and could be due to its phytochemicals, which have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties. Lubricin is a chondroprotective glycoprotein and it serves as a critical boundary lubricant between opposing cartilage surfaces. A joint injury causes an initial flare of cytokines, which decreases lubricin expression and predisposes to cartilage degeneration such as osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of extra-virgin olive oil diet and physical activity on inflammation and expression of lubricin in articular cartilage of rats after injury. In this study we used histomorphometric, histological, immunocytochemical, immunohistochemical, western blot and biochemical analysis for lubricin and interleukin-1 evaluations in the cartilage and in the synovial fluid. We report the beneficial effect of physical activity (treadmill training) and extra-virgin olive oil supplementation, on the articular cartilage. The effects of anterior cruciate ligament transection decrease drastically the expression of lubricin and increase the expression of interleukin-1 in rats, while after physical activity and extra-virgin olive oil supplemented diet, the values return to a normal level compared to the control group. With our results we can confirm the importance of the physical activity in conjunction with extra-virgin olive oil diet in medical therapy to prevent osteoarthritis disease in order to preserve the articular cartilage and then the entire joint.},

High-concentration glucose was administered into chicken eggs and resulted in increased plasma and brain tissue glucose, and suppressed expression of glucose transporters (GLUTs). The rate of NTD positively correlated with hyperglycemia. Furthermore, abnormally increased O-GlcNAcylation, a nutritionally responsive modification, of the key neural tube marker Pax3 protein led to the loss of this protein. This loss was not observed in a folate-deficiency NTD induced by methotrexate. Carnosine, an endogenous dipeptide, showed significant recovery effects on neural tube development. In contrast, folic acid, a well-known periconceptional agent, surprisingly showed relatively minimal effect. Higher expression levels of the Pax3 protein were found in the carnosine-treated groups, while lower expression levels were found in folic acid groups. Furthermore, the abnormal O-GlcNAcylation of the Pax3 protein was restored by carnosine. These results suggest new insights into using endogenous nutrients for the protection of embryonic neurodevelopment affected by diabetes gestation. The abnormal excessive O-GlcNAcylation of Pax3 may be responsible for the neural tube defects associated with hyperglycemia.},

	abstract = {Aging is a major factor involved in neurological impairments, decreased anti-oxidant activities, and enhanced neuroinflammation. D-galactose (D-gal) has been considered an artificial aging model which induces oxidative stress and inflammatory response resulting in memory and synaptic dysfunction. Dietary supplementation exerts valuable effects against oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Polyphenolic flavonoids, such as anthocyanins, have been reported as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant agents against various neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, our group reported anthocyanin neuroprotection of the developing rat brain against ethanol-induced oxidative stress and neurodegenaration and ethanol-induced neuronal apoptosis via GABAB1 receptor intracellular signaling in prenatal rat hippocampus. Here, we examined the protective effect of anthocyanin neuroprotection against D-gal-induced oxidative and inflammatory response in the hippocampus and cortex regions and explore the potential mechanism of its action. Our results indicated that anthocyanins treatment significantly improved behavioral performance of D-gal-treated rats in Morris water maze and Y-maze tests. One of the potential mechanisms of this action was decreased expression of the receptor for advance glycation end product, reduced level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation as well as markers of the Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the results also indicated that anthocyanins inhibited activated astrocytes and neuroinflammation via suppression of various inflammatory markers including p-NF- K B, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) in the hippocampus and cortex regions of D-gal-treated rats brain. Moreover, anthocyanins abrogated neuroapoptosis via C-jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) suppression and improved deregulated synaptic proteins including synaptophysin, synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP)-23, SNAP-25, and phosphorylated CREB. This data suggests that anthocyanins could be a safe and promising anti-oxidant and anti-neuroinflammatory agent for age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of lingonberry extraction on mice cognitive impairment caused by chronic stress.
METHODS: Kunming mice were randomly divided into six groups, which were control group, stress model group, the fluoxetine group (dose of 4.4 mg 路 kg(-1) 路 d(-1)), lingonberry extraction low, medium and high dose group (respectively 50, 100 and 200 mg 路 kg(-1) 路 d(-1)). All groups were given chronic uncertainty stress but the control group, and were intragastric administration for 18 days. Then the cognition of the mice was tested by using water maze, the contents of the SOD, GSH-Px, MDA and the activity of the neurotransmitters such as noradreline (NE), serotonin (5-HT), glucocorticoids (GC), acetylcholinesterase (AchE) were measured by using kit.
RESULTS: Lingonberry extraction improved the cognition and memory of the mice induced by chronic uncertainty stress, increased the content of the SOD and GSH-Px in mice brain, and decreased the content of oxidative damage markers MDA. Lingonberry extraction could also inhibit the increase of GC, inhibit the activity of AchE in blood serum, elevated the content of 5-HT and NE in mice blood serum and brain.
CONCLUSION: Lingonberry extraction improved the cognition and memory of the mice induced by chronic uncertainty stress. The possible mechanism was that lingonberry enhanced the antioxidative ability of tissue and improved the disorder of neurotransmitter levels caused by chronic stress.},

Beneficial actions of the activated Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway in stroke, such as improving neurological function, promoting neurogenesis, anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and pro-angiogenic effects, have been noted, but relatively little is known about the role of Shh signaling in resveratrol-reduced cerebral ischemic injury after stroke. The present study tests whether the Shh pathway mediates resveratrol to decrease cerebral ischemic injury and improve neurological function after stroke. We observed that resveratrol pretreatment significantly improved neurological function, decreased infarct volume, enhanced vitality, and reduced apoptosis of neurons in vivo and vitro after stroke. Meanwhile, expression levels of Shh, Ptc-1, Smo, and Gli-1 mRNAs were significantly upregulated and Gli-1 was relocated to the nucleus. Intriguingly, in vivo and in vitro inhibition of the Shh signaling pathway with cyclopamine, a Smo inhibitor, completely reversed the above effects of resveratrol. These results suggest that decreased cerebral ischemic injury and improved neurological function by resveratrol may be mediated by the Shh signaling pathway.},

The aim of this study was to investigate BRB-caused metabolite changes using the Apc(Min/+) mouse as a model of human colorectal cancer. Wild-type (WT) mice were fed control diet, and Apc(Min/+) mice were fed either control diet or control diet supplemented with 5\% BRBs for 8 weeks. Colonic and intestinal polyp size and number were measured. A non-targeted metabolomic analysis was conducted on colonic mucosa, liver and fecal specimens. Eight weeks of BRB treatment significantly decreased intestinal and colonic polyp number and size in Apc(Min/+) mice. The apc gene mutation significantly changed 52 metabolites in colonic mucosa associated with increased amino acid and decreased lipid metabolites, as well as 39 liver and 8 fecal metabolites. BRBs significantly reversed 23 apc-regulated metabolites, including 13 colonic mucosa, 8 liver and 2 fecal metabolites that were involved in amino acid, glutathione, lipid and nucleotide metabolism. Of these, changes in eight metabolites were linearly correlated with decreased colonic polyp number and size in BRB-treated Apc(Min/+) mice. Elevated levels of putrescine and linolenate in Apc(Min/+) mice were significantly decreased by BRBs. Ornithine decarboxylase expression, the key enzyme in putrescine generation, was fully suppressed by BRBs. These results suggest that BRBs produced beneficial effects against colonic adenoma development in Apc(Min/+) mice and modulated multiple metabolic pathways. The metabolite changes produced by BRBs might potentially reflect the BRB-mediated chemopreventive effects in colorectal cancer patients.},

The degree of cellulite was evaluated before starting the treatment and after 3 and 6 months of intake. In addition, skin waviness, dermal density, and the length of subcutaneous borderline were assessed. BCP treatment led to a statistically significant decrease in the degree of cellulite and a reduced skin waviness on thighs (P {\textless} 0.05) in normal weight women. Moreover, dermal density was significantly improved (P {\textless} 0.05) compared to placebo. The subcutaneous borderline showed a significant shortening after BCP intake compared to the beginning of the study, indicating cellulite improvement, but the data failed to reach statistical significance compared to placebo. The efficacy of BCP treatment was also confirmed in overweight women, although the impact was less pronounced in comparison with women of normal body weight. The results of the study demonstrated that a regular ingestion of BCP over a period of 6 months led to a clear improvement of the skin appearance in women suffering from moderate cellulite. Based on the current data, it can be concluded that a long-term therapy with orally administered BCP leads to an improvement of cellulite and has a positive impact on skin health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Skin is constantly exposed to pro-oxidant environmental stress from several sources, including air pollutants, ultraviolet solar light, and chemical oxidants. Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in age-related skin disorders. Dietary bioactive antioxidant compounds, such as polyphenols, have beneficial effects on skin health. The advantage of a nutritional administration route is that blood delivers nutraceutical bioactive compounds continuously to all skin compartments, ie, the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the topical and systemic effects of a dietary supplement containing resveratrol and procyanidin on age-related alterations to the skin, the skin antioxidant pool, and systemic oxidative stress levels.
METHODS: An instrumental study was performed in 50 subjects (25 treated with supplements and 25 with placebo) to identify clinical features induced by chronoaging or photoaging. Product efficacy was evaluated after 60 days of treatment in terms of in vivo and in situ skin hydration, elasticity, and skin roughness levels, systemic oxidative stress levels by plasmatic derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites and oxyadsorbent tests, and extent of the skin antioxidant pool.
RESULTS: After 60 days of treatment, values for systemic oxidative stress, plasmatic antioxidant capacity, and skin antioxidant power had increased significantly. Additionally, skin moisturization and elasticity had improved, while skin roughness and depth of wrinkles had diminished. Intensity of age spots had significantly decreased, as evidenced by improvement in the individual typological angle.
CONCLUSION: Nutraceutical and pharmacological intervention with a supplement characterized by a specific blend of resveratrol and procyanidin may be a promising strategy to support treatments for the reduction of skin wrinkling, as well as reducing systemic and skin oxidative stress.},

The inhibitory effect of vitamin D3 on α-glucosidase as well as its mechanism of action was investigated in this work. The results showed that vitamin D3 exhibited stronger inhibition on α-glucosidase than acarbose with the IC50 value of 1.28 × 10(-4) mol L(-1), and the inhibition was a mixed-type mechanism through a multiphase kinetic process. The inhibition constant was determined to be (5.66 ± 0.03) × 10(-5) mol L(-1). Vitamin D3 interacted with α-glucosidase by hydrophobic interactions, and molecular docking further verified that the inhibitor inserted into the active site pocket of α-glucosidase and interacted with the amino residues, which induced the rearrangement and conformational changes of α-glucosidase, and might move to cover the active pocket, hindering the binding of the substrate leading to the inhibition of the enzyme activity. Moreover, it was found that vitamin D3 combined with vitamin B1 or vitamin B2 exhibited significant synergistic effects on inhibition of α-glucosidase. This study has provided new insights into the role of vitamin D3 in inhibiting α-glucosidase catalysis and offered useful information on the dietary recommendation of vitamin D3 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ultrafiltration (UF) failure mostly contributes to technical failure in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, and one of its responsible factors is peritoneal angiogenesis. Resveratrol has been proposed to have an angiogenesis-ameliorating effect on tumor patients. We hypothesize trans-resveratrol has beneficial effects on angiogenesis-related markers in PD patients.
METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, and double-blind trial, 72 patients were randomly assigned to 12-week treatment of low-dose or high-dose (150 or 450 mg/d) trans-resveratrol or a placebo. Visits were scheduled at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment. Clinical indices including 24-hour UF volume, UF rate, 24-hour urine volume, residual renal function, and dialysis adequacy (kt/v) were measured. Angiogenesis markers including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fetal liver kinase-1 (Flk-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), tyrosine kinase 2 (Tie-2), and thrombospondin-1 (Tsp-1) in peritoneal effluent were also assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Finally, 64 out of 72 patients were analyzed, 18 in the high-dose group, 22 in the low-dose group, and 24 in the placebo group. Over the 12-week period, patients in the high-dose group [mean change from baseline (95\% CI): 171.4 (141.3-201.5) (mL), p = 0.003 (Net UF); 11.3(10.5-12.1) (mL/h), p = 0.02 (UF rate)] or the low-dose group [mean change from baseline (95\% CI: 98.1 (49.5-146.7) (mL), p = 0.007 (Net UF); 6.5 (4.4-8.6) (mL/h), p = 0.04 (UF rate)] versus the placebo group had a significantly greater improvement in mean net UF volume and UF rate. The appearance rates of VEGF, Flk-1, and Ang-2 were more significantly reduced (appearance rates of Tie-2 and Tsp-1 increased) in the high-dose group versus the placebo group, but not in the low-dose group.
CONCLUSION: Supplementation with trans-resveratrol is beneficial to improve ultrafiltration in PD patients, and high-dose supplementation may improve ultrafiltration by ameliorating angiogenesis induced by conventional lactate-buffered PD solutions.},

In this study, two different species of açaí pulp extracts, naturally grown in two distinct regions of the Amazon, namely, Euterpe oleracea Mart. (habitat: Brazilian floodplains of the Amazon) and Euterpe precatoria Mart. (habitat: Bolivian Amazon), were studied for their effects on brain health and cognition.
METHODS: Neurochemical analyses were performed in critical brain regions associated with memory and cognition of 19-month-old açaí-fed rats, in whom the cognitive benefits of açaí had been established.
RESULTS: Results indicated significant reductions (P{\textless} 0.05) in prooxidant NADPH-oxidoreductase-2 (NOX2) and proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB in açaí-fed rats. Measurement of Nrf2 expression, a transcription factor for antioxidant enzymes, and a possible link between oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and autophagy mechanisms, indicated significant overexpression (P{\textless}0.005) in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of the açaí-fed rats. Furthermore, significant activation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes GST and SOD were also observed in the açaí-fed animals when compared to control. Analysis of autophagy markers such as p62, phospho-mTOR, beclin1 and MAP1B-LC3 revealed differential expression in frontal cortex and hippocampus, mostly indicating an upregulation in the açaí-fed rats.
DISCUSSION: In general, results were more profound for EP than EO in hippocampus as well as frontal cortex. Therefore, an açaí-enriched diet could possibly modulate Nrf2, which is known to modulate the intracellular redox status, thereby regulating the ubiquitin-proteosomal pathway, ultimately affecting cognitive function in the aging brain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Each year in the United States, nearly 50,000 prostate cancer patients exhibit a rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, which can indicate disease recurrence. For patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, we evaluated the effects of white button mushroom (WBM) powder on serum PSA levels and determined the tolerability and biological activity of WBM.
METHODS: Patients with continuously rising PSA levels were enrolled in the study. Dose escalation was conducted in cohorts of 6; this ensured that no more than 1 patient per cohort experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The primary objective was to evaluate treatment feasibility and associated toxicity. The secondary objectives were to determine WBM's effect on serum PSA/androgen levels; myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs); and cytokine levels.
RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were treated; no DLTs were encountered. The overall PSA response rate was 11\%. Two patients receiving 8 and 14 g/d demonstrated complete response (CR): their PSA declined to undetectable levels that continued for 49 and 30 months. Two patients who received 8 and 12 g/d experienced partial response (PR). After 3 months of therapy, 13 (36\%) patients experienced some PSA decrease below baseline. Patients with CR and PR demonstrated higher levels of baseline interleukin-15 than nonresponders; for this group, we observed therapy-associated declines in MDSCs.
CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with WBM appears to both impact PSA levels and modulate the biology of biochemically recurrent prostate cancer by decreasing immunosuppressive factors.},

	abstract = {Several studies have reported that lactic acid bacteria may increase the production of free fatty acids by lipolysis of milk fat, though no studies have been found in the literature showing the effect of kefir grains on the composition of fatty acids in milk. In this study the influence of kefir grains from different origins [Rio de Janeiro (AR), Viçosa (AV) e Lavras (AD)], different time of storage, and different fat content on the fatty acid content of cow milk after fermentation was investigated. Fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography. Values were considered significantly different when p{\textless}0.05. The highest palmitic acid content, which is antimutagenic compost, was seen in AV grain (36.6g/100g fatty acids), which may have contributed to increasing the antimutagenic potential in fermented milk. Higher monounsaturated fatty acid (25.8 g/100g fatty acids) and lower saturated fatty acid (72.7 g/100g fatty acids) contents were observed in AV, when compared to other grains, due to higher Δ9-desaturase activity (0.31) that improves the nutritional quality of lipids. Higher oleic acid (25.0 g/100g fatty acids) and monounsaturated fatty acid (28.2g/100g fatty acids) and lower saturated fatty acid (67.2g/100g fatty acids) contents were found in stored kefir relatively to fermented kefir leading to possible increase of antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic potential and improvement of nutritional quality of lipids in storage milk. Only high-lipidic matrix displayed increase polyunsaturated fatty acids after fermentation. These findings open up new areas of study related to optimizing desaturase activity during fermentation in order to obtaining a fermented product with higher nutritional lipid quality.},

	abstract = {Several studies have investigated the effects of fish oil (FO) on infant growth, but little is known about the effects of FO and sex on insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), the main regulator of growth in childhood. We explored whether FO v. sunflower oil (SO) supplementation from 9 to 18 months of age affected IGF-1 and its binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and whether the potential effects were sex specific. Danish infants (n 115) were randomly allocated to 5 ml/d FO (1·2 g/d n-3 long-chain PUFA (n-3 LCPUFA)) or SO. We measured growth, IGF-1, IGFBP-3 and erythrocyte EPA, a biomarker of n-3 LCPUFA intake and status, at 9 and 18 months. Erythrocyte EPA increased strongly with FO compared with SO (P{\textless}0·001). There were no effects of FO compared with SO on IGF-1 in the total population, but a sex × group interaction (P=0·02). Baseline-adjusted IGF-1 at 18 months was 11·1 µg/l (95\% CI 0·4, 21·8; P=0·04) higher after FO compared with SO supplementation among boys only. The sex × group interaction was borderline significant in the model of IGFBP-3 (P=0·09), with lower IGFBP-3 with FO compared with SO among girls only (P=0·03). The results were supported by sex-specific dose-response associations between changes in erythrocyte EPA and changes in IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 (both P{\textless}0·03). Moreover, IGF-1 was sex specifically associated with BMI and length. In conclusion, FO compared with SO resulted in higher IGF-1 among boys and lower IGFBP-3 among girls.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) is known for improving vascular function. However, there has been no study evaluating its effects on 24-h systolic and diastolic blood pressure in prehypertensive patients. The aim of this study was to examine those effects.
METHODS: Patients with prehypertension (N = 45) were prospectively randomized into a moderate-dose black raspberry group (n = 15, 1500 mg/d), a high-dose black raspberry group (n = 15, 2500 mg/d), or a placebo group (n = 15) during an 8-wk follow-up period. Raspberries were consumed in the form of a dried powder extract that was fashioned into capsules. The capsules contained 187.5 and 312.5 mg of raspberry powder, which was equivalent to 1500 and 2500 mg raspberries. Ambulatory 24-h blood pressure (BP); central BP; pulse-wave velocity; abdominal visceral fat; serum renin; angiotensin-converting enzyme; and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were measured at baseline and at 8-wk follow-up.
RESULTS: High-dose black raspberry significantly reduced 24-h systolic blood pressure (SBP; 3.3 ± 10 mm Hg versus -6.7 ± 11.8 mm Hg; P {\textless} 0.05) and nighttime SBP (5.4 ± 10.6 mm Hg versus -4.5 ± 11.3 mm Hg; P {\textless} 0.05) compared with controls during the 8-wk follow-up. Black raspberry powder did not produce any significant changes in most of the parameters other than BP.
CONCLUSION: The use of black raspberry significantly lowered 24-h BP in prehypertensive patients during the 8-wk follow-up. Black raspberry used as a dietary supplement could be beneficial in reducing SBP in prehypertensive patients.},

These changes may predispose older adults to chronic disease and functional impairment; ultimately resulting in a decrease in the quality of life. Research has suggested that long chain omega-3 fatty acids, found predominantly in fatty fish, may assist in reducing these changes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of fish oil (FO) supplementation in a cohort of healthy, community-dwelling older females on 1) metabolic rate and substrate oxidation at rest and during exercise; 2) resting blood pressure and resting and exercise heart rates; 3) body composition; 4) strength and physical function, and; 5) blood measures of insulin, glucose, c-reactive protein, and triglycerides. Twenty-four females (66 Â± 1 yr) were recruited and randomly assigned to receive either 3g/d of EPA and DHA or a placebo (PL, olive oil) for 12 wk. Exercise measurements were taken before and after 12 wk of supplementation and resting metabolic measures were made before and at 6 and 12 wk of supplementation. The results demonstrated that FO supplementation significantly increased resting metabolic rate by 14\%, energy expenditure during exercise by 10\%, and the rate of fat oxidation during rest by 19\% and during exercise by 27\%. In addition, FO consumption lowered triglyceride levels by 29\% and increased lean mass by 4\% and functional capacity by 7\%, while no changes occurred in the PL group. In conclusion, FO may be a strategy to improve age-related physical and metabolic changes in healthy older females. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01734538.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liquorice ingestion often elevates blood pressure, but the detailed haemodynamic alterations are unknown. We studied haemodynamic changes induced by liquorice consumption in 20 subjects versus 30 controls with average blood pressures of 120/68 and 116/64 mmHg, respectively.
METHODS: Haemodynamic variables were measured in supine position before and after two weeks of liquorice consumption (daily glycyrrhizin dose 290-370 mg) with tonometric recording of radial blood pressure, pulse wave analysis, and whole-body impedance cardiography. Thirty age-matched healthy subjects maintaining their normal diet were studied as controls.
RESULTS: Two weeks of liquorice ingestion elevated peripheral and central systolic and diastolic blood pressure (by 7/4 and 8/4 mmHg, 95\% confidence intervals [CI] 2-11/1-8 and 3-13/1-8, respectively, P{\textless}0.05), and increased extracellular volume by 0.5 litres (P{\textless}0.05 versus controls). Also augmentation index adjusted to heart rate 75/min (from 7\% to 11\%, 95\% CI for change 0.3-7.5, P{\textless}0.05) and aortic pulse pressure (by 4 mmHg, 95\% CI 1-7, P{\textless}0.05) were elevated indicating increased wave reflection from the periphery. In contrast, peripheral (-3/-0.3 mmHg) and central blood pressure (-2/-0.5 mmHg), aortic pulse pressure (-1 mmHg), and augmentation index adjusted to heart rate 75/min (from 9\% to 7\%) decreased numerically but not statistically significantly without changes in extracellular volume in the control group. Heart rate, systemic vascular resistance, cardiac output, and pulse wave velocity did not differ between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Two weeks of daily liquorice consumption increased extracellular volume, amplified pressure wave reflection from the periphery, and elevated central systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: S-Allylcysteine (SAC) is a key component of aged garlic extract, one of many garlic products. However, information on its pharmacokinetics has been scant except for data from a few animal studies.
OBJECTIVE: We designed this study to determine the overall pharmacokinetics of SAC in rats.
METHODS: After oral or intravenous administration of SAC to rats at a dose of 5 mg/kg, the plasma concentration-time profile of SAC and its metabolites, as well as the amounts excreted in bile and urine, were analyzed by using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: After oral administration, SAC was well absorbed with a bioavailability of 98\%. Two major metabolites of SAC, N-acetyl-S-allylcysteine (NAc-SAC) and N-acetyl-S-allylcysteine sulfoxide (NAc-SACS), were detected in plasma, but their concentrations were markedly lower than those of SAC. SAC was metabolized to a limited extent, but most of the orally absorbed SAC was excreted into urine in the form of its N-acetylated metabolites. The amounts of SAC, NAc-SAC, and NAc-SACS excreted in urine over 24 h were 2.9\%, 80\%, and 11\% of the orally administered SAC, respectively. The very low renal clearance (0.016 L ⋅ h(-1) ⋅ kg(-1)) of SAC indicated that it undergoes extensive renal reabsorption. These results collectively suggested that SAC was ultimately metabolized to NAc-SAC and NAc-SACS through the cycles of urinary excretion, renal reabsorption, and systemic recirculation.
CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetics of SAC in rats were characterized by high oral absorption, limited metabolism, and extensive renal reabsorption, all of which potentially contribute to its high and relatively long-lasting plasma concentrations.},

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether AGE reduces coronary plaque volume measured by cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS).
METHODS: Fifty-five patients with MetS (mean ± SD age: 58.7 ± 6.7 y; 71\% men) were prospectively assigned to consume 2400 mg AGE/d (27 patients) or placebo (28 patients) orally. Both groups underwent CCTA at baseline and follow-up 354 ± 41 d apart. Coronary plaque volume, including total plaque volume (TPV), dense calcium (DC), NCP, and low-attenuation plaque (LAP), were measured based upon predefined intensity cutoff values. Multivariable linear regression analysis, adjusted for age, gender, number of risk factors, hyperlipidemia medications, history of coronary artery disease, scan interval time, and baseline \%TPV, was performed to examine whether AGE affected each plaque change.
RESULTS: The \%LAP change was significantly reduced in the AGE group compared with the placebo group (-1.5\% ± 2.3\% compared with 0.2\% ± 2.0\%, P = 0.0049). In contrast, no difference was observed in \%TPV change (0.3\% ± 3.3\% compared with 1.6\% ± 3.0\%, P = 0.13), \%NCP change (0.2\% ± 3.3\% compared with 1.4\% ± 2.9\%, P = 0.14), and \%DC change (0.2\% ± 1.4\%, compared with 0.2\% ± 1.7\%, P = 0.99). Multivariable linear regression analysis found a beneficial effect of AGE on \%LAP regression (β: -1.61; 95\% CI: -2.79, -0.43; P = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the \%LAP change was significantly greater in the AGE group than in the placebo group. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether AGE has the ability to stabilize vulnerable plaque and decrease adverse cardiovascular events.

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to determine the potential effect of supplementation with a novel, hydrolyzed chicken sternal cartilage extract-called BioCell Collagen-on biomarkers and functional indices of recovery from intense exercise.
DESIGN: The research team designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.
SETTING: The study was conducted at the Center for Applied Health Sciences in Stow, OH, USA.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 8 healthy, recreationally active individuals, with a mean age of 29.3 y.
INTERVENTION: Participants ingested either 3 g of a novel, hydrolyzed chicken sternal cartilage extract called BioCell Collagen ("supplement") or 3 g of a placebo daily for 6 wk prior to challenge with an upper-body, muscle-damaging resistance exercise (UBC) on day 43 and a rechallenge on day 46 to assess functional recovery.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary endpoints were levels of 3 blood biomarkers-creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP)- and scores on a clinical pain scale and a perceived recovery scale (PRS).
RESULTS: The extract attenuated the post-UBC increase in serum markers for muscle tissue damage: CK, LDH, and CRP. For the intervention group vs the placebo group, the mean changes were as follows: (1) an increase in CK of 20 U/L vs 4726 U/L, respectively; (2) a decrease in LDH of 3.5 U/L vs an increase of 82.9 U/L, respectively; and (3) an increase in CRP of 0.07 mg/L vs an increase of 0.7 mg/L, respectively. The performance decrement in bench press repetitions to failure was 57.9\% on day 43 and 57.8\% on day 46 for the intervention group vs 72.2\% on day 43 and 65\% on day 46 for the placebo group. The overall trend for the performance decrement, together with the results for the PRS, suggested that a more robust muscular recovery and adaptive response occurred with use of the extract. The supplement was well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: The study's preliminary data are promising with regard to the beneficial effects of the extract on connective tissue protection and recovery in those engaged in routine resistance training and cardiovascular exercise. A larger study is warranted to confirm and refine these findings.},

UV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause the up-regulation of metalloproteinase (MMPs) and the degradation of dermal collagen and elastic fibers. Garlic and its components have been reported to exert antioxidative effects. The present study investigated the protective effect of garlic on UV-induced photoaging and MMPs regulation in hairless mice. Garlic was supplemented in the diet, and Skh-1 hairless mice were exposed to UV irradiation five days/week for eight weeks. Mice were divided into four groups; Non-UV, UV-irradiated control, UV+1\% garlic powder diet group, and UV+2\% garlic powder diet group. Chronic UV irradiation induced rough wrinkling of the skin with hyperkeratosis, and administration of garlic diminished the coarse wrinkle formation. UV-induced dorsal skin and epidermal thickness were also ameliorated by garlic supplementation. ROS generation, skin and serum malondialdehyde levels were significantly increased by UV exposure and were ameliorated by garlic administration although the effects were not dose-dependent. Antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in skin tissues were markedly reduced by UV irradiation and garlic treatment increased these enzyme activities. UV-induced MMP-1 and MMP-2 protein levels were suppressed by garlic administration. Furthermore, garlic supplementation prevented the UV-induced increase of MMP-1 mRNA expression and the UV-induced decrease of procollagen mRNA expression. These results suggest that garlic may be effective for preventing skin photoaging accelerated by UV irradiation through the antioxidative system and MMP regulation.},

	abstract = {AIM/HYPOTHESIS: Skeletal muscle insulin resistance and oxidative stress are characteristic metabolic disturbances in people with type 2 diabetes. Studies in insulin resistant rodents show an improvement in skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and oxidative stress following antioxidant supplementation. We therefore investigated the potential ameliorative effects of antioxidant ascorbic acid (AA) supplementation on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and oxidative stress in people with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: Participants with stable glucose control commenced a randomized cross-over study involving four months of AA (2 × 500 mg/day) or placebo supplementation. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using a hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic clamp coupled with infusion of 6,6-D2 glucose. Muscle biopsies were measured for AA concentration and oxidative stress markers that included basal measures (2',7'-dichlorofluorescin [DCFH] oxidation, ratio of reduced-to-oxidized glutathione [GSH/GSSG] and F2-Isoprostanes) and insulin-stimulated measures (DCFH oxidation). Antioxidant concentrations, citrate synthase activity and protein abundances of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2), total Akt and phosphorylated Akt (ser473) were also measured in muscle samples.
RESULTS: AA supplementation significantly increased insulin-mediated glucose disposal (delta rate of glucose disappearance; ∆Rd) (p=0.009), peripheral insulin-sensitivity index (p=0.046), skeletal muscle AA concentration (p=0.017) and muscle SVCT2 protein expression (p=0.008); but significantly decreased skeletal muscle DCFH oxidation during hyperinsulinaemia (p=0.007) when compared with placebo. Total superoxide dismutase activity was also lower following AA supplementation when compared with placebo (p=0.006). Basal oxidative stress markers, citrate synthase activity, endogenous glucose production, HbA1C and muscle Akt expression were not significantly altered by AA supplementation.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In summary, oral AA supplementation ameliorates skeletal muscle oxidative stress during hyperinsulinaemia and improves insulin-mediated glucose disposal in people with type 2 diabetes. Findings implicate AA supplementation as a potentially inexpensive, convenient, and effective adjunct therapy in the treatment of insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol found in the skin of red grapes, is reported to have anti-inflammatory properties including protective effects against aging. Consequently, Resveratrol is a common nutritional supplement and additive in non-prescription lotions and creams marketed as anti-aging products. Studies in mice and with mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) have indicated anti-allergic effects of Resveratrol. However, the effects of Resveratrol on human primary mast cells have not been reported.
METHODS: Human mast cells were isolated and purified from normal skin tissue of different donors. The effect of Resveratrol on IgE-dependent release of allergic inflammatory mediators was determined using various immunoassays, Western blotting, and quantitative real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Resveratrol at low concentrations (≤10 μM) inhibited PGD2 biosynthesis but not degranulation. Accordingly, COX-2 expression was inhibited but phosphorylation of Syk, Akt, p38, and p42/44 (ERKs) remained intact. Surprisingly, TNF production was significantly enhanced with Resveratrol. At a high concentration (100 μM), Resveratrol significantly inhibited all parameters analyzed except Syk phosphorylation.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we show that Resveratrol at low concentrations exerts its anti-inflammatory properties by preferentially targeting the arachidonic acid pathway. We also demonstrate a previously unrecognized pro-inflammatory effect of Resveratrol--the enhancement of TNF production from human mature mast cells following IgE-dependent activation.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that Resveratrol as a therapeutic agent could inhibit PGD2-mediated inflammation but would be ineffective against histamine-mediated allergic reactions. However, Resveratrol could potentially exacerbate or promote allergic inflammation by enhancing IgE-dependent TNF production from mast cells in human skin.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that diet-induced fractalkine (FKN) stimulates neuroinflammation in animal models of obesity, yet how it occurs is unclear. This study investigated the role of FKN and it receptor, CX3CR1, in fructose-induced neuroinflammation, and examined curcumin's beneficial effect. Fructose feeding was found to induce hippocampal microglia activation with neuroinflammation through the activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) signaling, resulting in the reduction of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of mice. Serum FKN levels, as well as hypothalamic FKN and CX3CR1 gene expression, were significantly increased in fructose-fed mice with hypothalamic microglia activation. Hippocampal gene expression of FKN and CX3CR1 was also up-regulated at 14d and normalized at 56d in mice fed with fructose, which were consistent with the change of GFAP. Furthermore, immunostaining showed that GFAP and FKN expression was increased in cornu amonis 1, but decreased in DG in fructose-fed mice. In vitro studies showed that GFAP and FKN expression was stimulated in astrocytes, and suppressed in mixed glial cells exposed to 48h-fructose, with the continual increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, increased FKN and CX3CR1 may cause a cross-talk between activated glial cells and neurons, playing an important role in the development of neuroinflammation in fructose-fed mice. Curcumin protected against neuronal damage in hippocampal DG of fructose-fed mice by inhibiting microglia activation and suppressed FKN/CX3CR1 up-regulation in the neuronal network. These results suggest a new therapeutic approach to protect against neuronal damage associated with dietary obesity-associated neuroinflammation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent randomized controlled trials have suggested that dietary nitrate (NO3(-)), found in beetroot and other vegetables, and inorganic NO3(-) salts decrease metabolic rate under resting and exercise conditions.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was therefore to determine from a systematic review and meta-analysis whether dietary NO3(-) supplementation significantly reduces metabolic rate, expressed as oxygen uptake (VO2), under resting and exercise conditions in healthy humans and those with cardiorespiratory diseases.
DESIGN: A systematic article search was performed on electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) from February to March 2015. The inclusion criteria included 1) randomized controlled trials; 2) studies reporting the effect of NO3(-) on VO2 under resting and/or exercise conditions; 3) comparison between dietary NO3(-) supplementation and placebo. Random-effects models were used to calculate the pooled effect size.
RESULTS: Twenty nine randomized placebo-controlled trials were included in the systematic review, and 26 of which were included in the meta-analysis. Dietary NO3(-) supplementation significantly decreases VO2 during submaximal intensity exercise [-0.26 (95\% IC: -0.38, -0.15), p {\textless} 0.01], but not in the sub-analysis of subjects with chronic diseases [-0.09 (95\% IC: -0.50, 0.32), p = 0.67]. When data were separately analyzed by submaximal intensity domains, NO3(-) supplementation reduces VO2 during moderate [-0.29 (95\% IC: -0.48,-0.10), p {\textless} 0.01] and heavy [-0.33 (95\% IC: -0.54,-0.12), p {\textless} 0.01] intensity exercise. When the studies with the largest effects were excluded from the meta-analysis, there is a trend for a VO2 decrease under resting condition in dietary NO3(-) supplementation [-0.28 (95\% IC: -0.62, 0.05), p = 0.10].
CONCLUSION: Dietary NO3(-) supplementation decreases VO2 during exercise performed in the moderate and heavy intensity domains in healthy subjects. The present meta-analysis did not show any significant effect of dietary NO3(-) supplementation on metabolic rate in subjects with chronic diseases, despite enhanced exercise tolerance.},

Plant-derived dietary fibre (non-digestible polysaccharides) and/or flavonoids may mediate the observed protective effects particularly through their interaction with the gut microbiota. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of fruit and vegetable (F\&V) intake on gut microbiota, with an emphasis on the role of flavonoids, and further to explore relationships between microbiota and factors associated with CVD risk. In the study, a parallel design with 3 study groups, participants in the two intervention groups representing high-flavonoid (HF) and low flavonoid (LF) intakes were asked to increase their daily F\&V intake by 2, 4 and 6 portions for a duration of 6 weeks each, while a third (control) group continued with their habitual diet. Faecal samples were collected at baseline and after each dose from 122 subjects. Faecal bacteria enumeration was performed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Correlations of dietary components, flavonoid intake and markers of CVD with bacterial numbers were also performed. A significant dose X treatment interaction was only found for Clostidium leptum-Ruminococcus bromii/flavefaciens with a significant increase after intake of 6 additional portions in the LF group. Correlation analysis of the data from all 122 subjects independent from dietary intervention indicated an inhibitory role of F\&V intake, flavonoid content and sugars against the growth of potentially pathogenic clostridia. Additionally, we observed associations between certain bacterial populations and CVD risk factors including plasma TNF-Î±, plasma lipids and BMI/waist circumference.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is considerable evidence that hypertension may increase the levels of cytokines via endothelial stimulation and may stimulate inflammatory reactions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral coenzyme Q10 supplementation on pro-inflammatory factors and adiponectin in mildly hypertensive patients.
METHODS: This 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out during 2012 - 2013 in Yazd. Sixty mildly hypertensive patients were randomly divided into two groups: placebo (PG, n = 30) and coenzyme Q10 (QG, n = 30). The QG was given 1 capsule containing 100 mg Q10 per day. The PG was given 1 capsule of the same size and color as the Q10 capsules, but it contained 100 mg of lactose. Plasma pro-inflammatory factors (IL6, IL2, and TNF-α), adiponectin, and hs-CRP were determined before and after the intervention.
RESULTS: The mean enhancement in adiponectin of QG was significantly higher than PG (from 21.1 ± 14.5 to 24.2 ± 15.5 ng/ml, P = 0.04). Significant declines in the median of IL6 (from 23 to 16 pg/ml, P = 0.001) and in the mean of hs-CRP were also observed in QG after intervention (from 3.53 ± 3.36 to 2.62 ± 2.51 mg/L, P = 0.03). In the two groups, no significant statistical changes were seen in the median of TNF-α and IL2.
CONCLUSION: Daily supplementation of 100 mg coenzyme Q10 can be effective in decreasing some pro-inflammatory factors, such as IL6 and hs-CRP, and in increasing adiponectin.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some patients experience statin-induced side effects or prefer nutraceutical approaches for the treatment of dyslipidemia. This has led to a search for alternative therapeutic approaches for dyslipidemia management. In recent studies Citrus bergamia (known as Bergamot) juice was able to reduce serum levels of lipids. Such benefit may be attributed to high amounts of flavonoids contained in Bergamot fruit juice (neoeriocitrin, neohesperidin, naringin). The aim of the present study was to fully investigate the effects of a Bergamot extract on cardio-metabolic parameters, including plasma lipids, atherogenic lipoproteins and subclinical atherosclerosis.
METHODS: Eighty subjects (42 men and 38 women, mean age: 55 ± 13 years) with moderate hypercholesterolemia [e.g., with plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations between 160 and 190 mg/dl (between 4.1 and 4.9 mmol/l)] were included. A Bergamot-derived extract (Bergavit R(®)) was given at a fixed dose daily (150 mg of flavonoids, with 16\% of neoeriocitrin, 47\% of neohesperidin and 37\% of naringin) for 6 months. Lipoprotein subfractions were assessed by gel electrophoresis. With this methodology low density lipoprotein (LDL) subclasses are distributed as seven bands (LDL-1 and -2 as large LDL, and LDL-3 to -7 as atherogenic small, dense LDL). Subclinical atherosclerosis was assessed by carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) using B-mode ultrasound.
RESULTS: After 6 months, Bergavit R(®) reduced total cholesterol (from 6.6 ± 0.4 to 5.8 ± 1.1 mmol/l, p {\textless} 0.0001), triglycerides (from 1.8 ± 0.6 to 1.5 ± 0.9 mmol/l, p = 0.0020), and LDL-cholesterol (from 4.6 ± 0.2 to 3.7 ± 1.0 mmol/l, p {\textless} 0.0001), while HDL- cholesterol increased (from 1.3 ± 0.2 to 1.4 ± 0.4 mmol/l, p {\textless} 0.0007). In addition, a significant increase in LDL-1 (from 41.2 ± 0.2 to 49.6 ± 0.2\%, p {\textless} 0.0001) was accompanied by decreased small, dense LDL-3, -4, and 5 particles (from 14.5 ± 0.1 to 9.0 ± 0.1\% p {\textless} 0.0001; 3.2 ± 0.1 to 1.5 ± 0.1\% p = 0.0053; 0.3 ± 0.0\% to 0.1 ± 0.0\% p = 0.0133, respectively). cIMT also decreased from 1.2 ± 0.4 to 0.9 ± 0.1 mm (p {\textless} 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study investigating the effects of Bergamot flavonoids supplementation on cardio-metabolic risk in dyslipidemic subjects. Bergavit R(®) (Bergamot juice extract) supplementation significantly reduced plasma lipids and improved the lipoprotein profile. cIMT was also reduced significantly over a relatively short time frame of 6 months.},

We here examined the effect of a diet high in AGEs in the context of an irradiated diet on memory, insoluble Aβ42 , AGEs levels in hippocampus, on expression of the receptor for AGEs (RAGE), and on oxidative stress in the vasculature. We found that AD-like model mice on high-AGE diet due to irradiation had significantly poorer memory, higher hippocampal levels of insoluble Aβ42 and AGEs as well as higher levels of oxidative stress on vascular walls, compared to littermates fed an isocaloric diet. These differences were not due to weight gain. The data were further supported by the overexpression of RAGE, which binds to Aβ42 and regulates its transport across the blood-brain barrier, suggesting a mediating pathway. Because exposure to AGEs can be diminished, these insights provide an important simple noninvasive potential therapeutic strategy for alleviating a major lifestyle-linked disease epidemic.},

An increase in MAO activity is closely related to age, and this may induce neuronal degeneration in the brain due to oxidative stress. MAO (and particularly monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B)) participates in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide that are toxic to dopaminergic cells and their surroundings. Although the polyphenol-rich aqueous walnut extract (JSE; an extract of Juglandis Semen) has been shown to have various beneficial bioactivities, no study has been dedicated to see if JSE is capable to protect dopaminergic neurons against neurotoxic insults in models of PD. In the present study we investigated the neuroprotective potential of JSE against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP⁺)- or 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicities in primary mesencephalic cells and in a mouse model of PD. Here we show that JSE treatment suppressed ROS and nitric oxide productions triggered by MPP⁺ in primary mesencephalic cells. JSE also inhibited depletion of striatal DA and its metabolites in vivo that resulted in significant improvement in PD-like movement impairment. Altogether our results indicate that JSE has neuroprotective effects in PD models and may have potential for the prevention or treatment of PD.},

However, no rigorous clinical trial has validated whether this beneficial effect of taurine occurs in human hypertension or prehypertension, a key stage in the development of hypertension. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we assessed the effects of taurine intervention on BP and vascular function in prehypertension. We randomly assigned 120 eligible prehypertensive individuals to receive either taurine supplementation (1.6 g per day) or a placebo for 12 weeks. Taurine supplementation significantly decreased the clinic and 24-hour ambulatory BPs, especially in those with high-normal BP. Mean clinic systolic BP reduction for taurine/placebo was 7.2/2.6 mm Hg, and diastolic BP was 4.7/1.3 mm Hg. Mean ambulatory systolic BP reduction for taurine/placebo was 3.8/0.3 mm Hg, and diastolic BP was 3.5/0.6 mm Hg. In addition, taurine supplementation significantly improved endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation and increased plasma H2S and taurine concentrations. Furthermore, changes in BP were negatively correlated with both the plasma H2S and taurine levels in taurine-treated prehypertensive individuals. To further elucidate the hypotensive mechanism, experimental studies were performed both in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that taurine treatment upregulated the expression of hydrogen sulfide-synthesizing enzymes and reduced agonist-induced vascular reactivity through the inhibition of transient receptor potential channel subtype 3-mediated calcium influx in human and mouse mesenteric arteries. In conclusion, the antihypertensive effect of chronic taurine supplementation shows promise in the treatment of prehypertension through improvement of vascular function.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12937-016-0125-5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies reported an association between plasma phosphate concentrations and a higher risk for death and cardiovascular events in subjects free of chronic kidney diseases. The main aims of the present study were to determine the influence of a high phosphorus intake in combination with different calcium supplies on phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and iron metabolism as well as fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) concentrations within eight weeks of supplementation.
METHODS: Sixty-two healthy subjects completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel designed study. Supplements were monosodium phosphate and calcium carbonate. During the first two weeks, all groups consumed a placebo sherbet powder, and afterwards, for eight weeks, a sherbet powder according to the intervention group: P1000/Ca0 (1 g/d phosphorus), P1000/Ca500 (1 g/d phosphorus and 0.5 g/d calcium) and P1000/Ca1000 (1 g/d phosphorus and 1 g/d calcium). Dietary records, fasting blood samplings, urine and fecal collections took place.
RESULTS: Fasting plasma phosphate concentrations did not change after any intervention. After all interventions, renal excretions and fecal concentrations of phosphorus increased significantly after eight weeks. Renal calcium and magnesium excretion decreased significantly after eight weeks of P1000/Ca0 intervention compared to placebo. Plasma FGF23 concentrations were significantly higher after four weeks compared to eight weeks of all interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: The long-term study showed in healthy adults no influence of high phosphorus intakes on fasting plasma phosphate concentrations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that a combination of glucosyl hesperidin (G-hesperidin) plus caffeine reduces accumulation of body fat, whereas G-hesperidin or caffeine alone shows little effect on high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice. The aim of this study is to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of G-hesperidin plus caffeine on body fat and serum TG in healthy subjects with moderately high body mass index (BMI) and serum TG. Since we considered that there are individual differences in caffeine sensitivity, we conducted dose-finding study of caffeine combined with G-hesperidin.
METHODS: Seventy-five healthy subjects with moderately high BMI (24-30 kg/m(2)) and serum TG (100-250 mg/dl) were divided and assigned to 12-week intervention with daily intakes of 500 mg of G-hesperidin with or without 25, 50, or 75 mg of caffeine, or placebo in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design .
RESULTS: After intervention, decreases in abdominal fat area (AFA), especially subcutaneous fat area (SFA), were significantly greater in the G-hesperidin with 50-mg caffeine group (AFA:-8.4 ± 21.9 v.s. 16.3 ± 34.1 cm(2); p {\textless} 0.05, SFA: -9.3 ± 17.1 v.s. 11.2 ± 18.3 cm(2); p {\textless} 0.01) and in the G-hesperidin with 75-mg caffeine group (AFA:-17.0 ± 31.4 v.s. 16.3 ± 34.1 cm(2); p {\textless} 0.01, SFA: -12.4 ± 18.7 v.s. 11.2 ± 18.3 cm(2); p {\textless} 0.01) than in the placebo group. Fat-decreasing effects of G-hesperidin were enhanced dose-dependently by caffeine addition. BMI decreases were significantly greater in the G-hesperidin with 75-mg caffeine group than in the placebo group (-0.56 ± 0.74 v.s. -0.02 ± 0.58 kg/m(2); p {\textless} 0.05). G-hesperidin with/without caffeine had no effect on serum TG (p {\textgreater} 0.05 v.s. placebo).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggested that a combination of 500-mg G-hesperidin with 50- or 75-mg caffeine may be useful for the prevention or treatment of obesity.

	volume = {75},
	issn = {1097-0045},
	doi = {10.1002/pros.23006},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol with purported inhibitory effects on prostate growth and cancer development. A number of studies have demonstrated that resveratrol reduces prostate growth in animal models and reduces prostate cell growth in vitro. Based on these pre-clinical findings, interest in resveratrol is increasing in relation to the management of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. So far, no human trials have evaluated the effects of resveratrol on circulating androgens, prostate size, or biochemical markers of prostate size.
METHODS: In a randomized placebo controlled clinical study using two doses of resveratrol (150 mg or 1,000 mg resveratrol daily) for 4 months, we evaluated the effects on prostate size, prostate specific antigen (PSA) and sex steroid hormones in 66 middle-aged men suffering from the metabolic syndrome(MetS).
RESULTS: At baseline, prostate size and PSA were positively correlated (R = 0.34, P {\textless} 0.007) as was prostate size and age (R = 0.37, P {\textless} 0.003). Prostate size did not correlate with testosterone, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), or any other androgen precursor at baseline. The highest dose of resveratrol lowered the serum level of androstenedione 24\% (P = 0.052), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) 41\% (P {\textless} 0.01), and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEAS) 50\% (p{\textless}0.001), compared to the control group. However, prostate size and levels of PSA, testosterone, free testosterone and DHT remained unchanged.
CONCLUSION: In this population of middle-aged men suffering from MetS, high dose resveratrol (1,000 mg daily) administration for 4 months significantly lowered serum levels of the androgen precursors androstenedione, DHEA and DHEAS, whereas prostate size and circulating levels of PSA, testosterone, free testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone were unaffected. The present study suggests that resveratrol does not affect prostate volume in healthy middle-aged men as measured by PSA levels and CT acquired prostate volumes. Consequently, we find no support for the use of resveratrol in the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia.},

We determined the effects of 4 weeks of oral supplementation of quercetin on plasma uric acid, blood pressure and fasting glucose. This randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial recruited twenty-two healthy males (19-60 years) with baseline plasma uric acid concentration in the higher, but still considered healthy, range (339 (SD 51) µmol/l). The intervention included one tablet containing 500 mg quercetin daily for 4 weeks, compared with placebo, with a 4-week washout period between treatments. The primary outcome was change in concentrations of plasma uric acid after 2 and 4 weeks; secondary outcome measures were changes in fasting plasma glucose, 24-h urinary excretion of uric acid and resting blood pressure. After quercetin treatment, plasma uric acid concentrations were significantly lowered by -26·5 µmol/l (95\% CI, -7·6, -45·5; P=0·008), without affecting fasting glucose, urinary excretion of uric acid or blood pressure. Daily supplementation of 500 mg quercetin, containing the bioavailable amount of quercetin as present in approximately 100 g red onions, for 4 weeks, significantly reduces elevated plasma uric acid concentrations in healthy males.},

We found that green tea polyphenols protected against glutamate induced neurotoxicity in the cortical neurons as measured by MTT and TUNEL assays. Green tea polyphenols were then showed to inhibit the glutamate induced ROS release and SOD activity reduction in the neurons. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that green tea polyphenols restored the dysfunction of mitochondrial pro- or antiapoptotic proteins Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 caused by glutamate. Interestingly, the neuroprotective effect of green tea polyphenols was abrogated when the neurons were incubated with siBcl-2.

In the present study, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study to examine the effect of PQQ disodium salt (BioPQQ™) on cognitive functions was conducted with 41 elderly healthy subjects. Subjects were orally given 20 mg of BioPQQ™ per day or placebo, for 12 weeks. For cognitive functions, selective attention by the Stroop and reverse Stroop test, and visual-spatial cognitive function by the laptop tablet Touch M, were evaluated. In the Stroop test, the change of Stroop interference ratios (SIs) for the PQQ group was significantly smaller than for the placebo group. In the Touch M test, the stratification analyses dividing each group into two groups showed that only in the lower group of the PQQ group (initial score{\textless}70), did the score significantly increase. Measurements of physiological parameters indicated no abnormal blood or urinary adverse events, nor adverse internal or physical examination findings at any point in the study. The preliminary experiment using near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS) suggests that cerebral blood flow in the prefrontal cortex was increased by the administration of PQQ. The results suggest that PQQ can prevent reduction of brain function in aged persons, especially in attention and working memory.},

	abstract = {Erucic acid is a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid isolated from the seed of Raphanus sativus L. that is known to normalize the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in the brains of patients suffering from X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Here, we investigated whether erucic acid enhanced cognitive function or ameliorated scopolamine-induced memory impairment using the passive avoidance, Y-maze and Morris water maze tasks. Erucic acid (3mg/kg, p.o.) enhanced memory performance in normal naïve mice. In addition, erucic acid (3mg/kg, p.o.) ameliorated scopolamine-induced memory impairment, as assessed via the behavioral tasks. We then investigated the underlying mechanism of the memory-enhancing effect of erucic acid. The administration of erucic acid increased the phosphorylation levels of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and additional protein kinase B (Akt) in the hippocampus. These results suggest that erucic acid has an ameliorative effect in mice with scopolamine-induced memory deficits and that the effect of erucic acid is partially due to the activation of PI3K-PKCζ-ERK-CREB signaling as well as an increase in phosphorylated Akt in the hippocampus. Therefore, erucic acid may be a novel therapeutic agent for diseases associated with cognitive deficits, such as Alzheimer's disease.},

Therefore, the systemic absorption of EGCG was tested in healthy fasted humans. It was administered as capsules with water or with a light breakfast, or when incorporated within a strawberry sorbet. The results for plasma EGCG clearly revealed that taking EGCG capsules without food was better; the AUC was 2.7 and 3.9 times higher than when EGCG capsules were taken with a light breakfast (p = 0.044) or with EGCG imbedded in the strawberry sorbet (p = 0.019), respectively. This pattern was also observed for Cmax and Cav. Therefore, ingesting food at the same time as EGCG, whether it was imbedded or not in food, substantially inhibited the absorption of the catechin. As with some types of medications that are affected by food, it appears that EGCG should be taken without food in order to maximise its systemic absorption. Therefore, based on these findings, ingesting EGCG with water on an empty stomach is the most appropriate method for the oral delivery of EGCG in clinical trials where EGCG is to be investigated as a potential bioactive nutraceutical in humans.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if (poly)phenols alter cardiovascular risk factors, we assessed the potential of a high (poly)phenol beverage drink, rich in hydroxycinnamates and flavonoids, to modify vascular function in middle aged, overweight or obese subjects without medical co-morbidity in a randomized placebo controlled pilot study.
METHODS: Randomly assigned active 250 ml beverages containing 361 mg of (poly)phenols and 120 mg of vitamin C or placebo (no polyphenol/vitamin C) were taken twice daily for 4 weeks. Both beverages contained 40 kcals/250 ml. The primary end-points were pulse wave velocity (PWV) and cutaneous microvascular responses to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and acetyl choline (ACh) laser doppler iontophoresis. A range of established and novel plasma markers were also measured.
RESULTS: Twenty subjects received active beverage and 19 placebo; all completed the study. There was no difference in cutaneous vascular response to either SNP or ACh with mean group differences (logÎ” area under perfusion curve) of 0.30 (-0.65, 1.26) and 0.35 (-0.11, 0.81) respectively. Nor was there evidence of a change in log PWV with a mean group difference of 0.029 m/s (-0.042, 0.10). No significant differences were seen in plasma leptin, apolipoproteins, cystatin C, insulin, adiponectin, CRP, ICAM-1, E-Selectin or t-PA, but IL-6 increased in active versus placebo recipients (0.32 vs - 0.18 pg/ml; p=0.010).
CONCLUSION: There was no evidence for a short-term beneficial effect of (poly)phenol intervention on microcutaneous vascular response or pulse wave velocity, and no evidence for a benefit on established or novel risk factors in overweight or obese subjects. Our results do not support a short-term benefit of (poly)phenol supplementation on cardiometabolic risk.

METHODS AND RESULTS: CA and MA were added in the daily food of mice throughout the experiment. Sixty mice were randomly divided into two groups: a low-fat diet (LFD, n = 12) group and HFD (n = 48) group. Mice in the HFD group were supplied with a HFD for 8 wks to induce obesity. The HFD-fed mice were then divided into four subgroups for another 8-wk experiment. The subgroups included the control group, HFD plus Orlistat group, and HFD plus CA or MA group, with each group consisting of 12 mice. Consumption of CA and MA at 200 mg/kg food reduced bodyweight gain by 29.6 and 32.7\%, respectively, in HFD-fed C57BL/6 mice. CA and MA supplementation could effectively improve the lipid profiles, decrease serum glucose and leptin levels, reduce MDA production, increase SOD and GPX activities, and down-regulate the expression of the TNFα, IL-6, iNOS, and NF-кB genes.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, MA and CA can potentially alter bodyweight by alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation in diet-induced obesity.},

To this end, in a seven-month pilot study we investigated the effects of a calorie-restricted, semi-vegetarian diet and administration of vitamin D and other dietary supplements (fish oil, lipoic acid, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, resveratrol and multivitamin complex) in 33 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and 10 patients with primary-progressive multiple sclerosis. At 0/3/6 months, patients had neurological examination, filled questionnaires and underwent anthropometric measurements and biochemical analyses. Serum fatty acids and vitamin D levels were measured as markers of dietary compliance and nutritional efficacy of treatment, whereas serum gelatinase levels were analyzed as markers of inflammatory status. All patients had insufficient levels of vitamin D at baseline, but their values did not ameliorate following a weekly administration of 5000  IU, and rather decreased over time. Conversely, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids increased already after three months, even under dietary restriction only. Co-treatment with interferon-beta in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis was irrelevant to vitamin D levels. After six months nutritional treatment, no significant changes in neurological signs were observed in any group. However, serum levels of the activated isoforms of gelatinase matrix metalloproteinase-9 decreased by 59\% in primary-progressive multiple sclerosis and by 51\% in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients under nutritional intervention, including dietary supplements. This study indicates that a healthy nutritional intervention is well accepted by people with multiple sclerosis and may ameliorate their physical and inflammatory status.},

	abstract = {Vitamin E (α-tocopherol) is recognised as a key essential lipophilic antioxidant in humans protecting lipoproteins, PUFA, cellular and intra-cellular membranes from damage. The aim of this review was to evaluate the relevant published data about vitamin E requirements in relation to dietary PUFA intake. Evidence in animals and humans indicates a minimal basal requirement of 4-5 mg/d of RRR-α-tocopherol when the diet is very low in PUFA. The vitamin E requirement will increase with an increase in PUFA consumption and with the degree of unsaturation of the PUFA in the diet. The vitamin E requirement related to dietary linoleic acid, which is globally the major dietary PUFA in humans, was calculated to be 0·4-0·6 mg of RRR-α-tocopherol/g of linoleic acid. Animal studies show that for fatty acids with a higher degree of unsaturation, the vitamin E requirement increases almost linearly with the degree of unsaturation of the PUFA in the relative ratios of 0·3, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexaenoic fatty acids, respectively. Assuming a typical intake of dietary PUFA, a vitamin E requirement ranging from 12 to 20 mg of RRR-α-tocopherol/d can be calculated. A number of guidelines recommend to increase PUFA intake as they have well-established health benefits. It will be prudent to assure an adequate vitamin E intake to match the increased PUFA intake, especially as vitamin E intake is already below recommendations in many populations worldwide.},

In the present study the role of carnosine on aging-induced changes of [(3)H]-5-HT receptor binding in different brain regions in a rat model was studied. The results showed that during aging (18 and 24 months) the [(3)H]-5-HT receptor binding was reduced in hippocampus, hypothalamus and pons-medulla with a decrease in their both Bmax and KD but in cerebral cortex the [(3)H]-5-HT binding was increased with the increase of its only Bmax. The aging-induced changes in [(3)H]-5-HT receptor binding with carnosine (2.0 Î¼g/kg/day, intrathecally, for 21 consecutive days) attenuated in (a) 24-month-aged rats irrespective of the brain regions with the attenuation of its Bmax except hypothalamus where both Bmax and KD were significantly attenuated, (b) hippocampus and hypothalamus of 18-month-aged rats with the attenuation of its Bmax, and restored toward the [(3)H]-5-HT receptor binding that observed in 4-month-young rats. The decrease in pons-medullary [(3)H]-5-HT binding including its Bmax of 18-month-aged rats was promoted with carnosine without any significant change in its cerebral cortex. The [(3)H]-5-HT receptor binding with the same dosages of carnosine in 4-month-young rats (a) increased in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus with the increase in their only Bmax whereas (b) decreased in hypothalamus and pons-medulla with a decrease in their both Bmax and KD. These results suggest that carnosine treatment may (a) play a preventive role in aging-induced brain region-specific changes in serotonergic activity (b) not be worthy in 4-month-young rats in relation to the brain regional serotonergic activity.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.pharep.2015.02.009},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Kahweol is a diterpene present in the oil derived from coffee beans. Although several pharmacological activities of kahweol are already well described in the literature, no study was done in order to assess the analgesic activity of this substance. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the possible peripheral antinociceptive effect of kahweol. Considering that the opioid peptides have been implicated in peripheral antinociception induced by non-opioidergic compounds, the present study also evaluated the endogenous opioids involvement in this effect.
METHODS: The rat paw pressure test was used, and hyperalgesia was induced by intraplantar injection of prostaglandin E2 (2μg/paw). All drugs were administered subcutaneously in the hindpaws of male Wistar rats. The expression of β-endorphin was examined by immunohistochemistry in the skin tissue samples of the plantar surface of rat right hindpaws.
RESULTS: Intraplantar injection of kahweol (40 and 80μg) induced significant peripheral antinociception. The antinociceptive effect of kahweol was due to a local peripheral action because the higher dose (80μg/paw) did not produce any effect in the contralateral paw. The opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (50 and 100μg/paw) prevented action of kahweol (80μg/paw) and the aminopeptidases inhibitor bestatin (400μg/paw) potentiated the antinociceptive effect of kahweol (40μg/paw). Furthermore, kahweol treatment increased the intensity of β-endorphin immunoreactivity in the epithelium of rat paws.
CONCLUSIONS: The results discussed here provide evidence that kahweol treatment has peripheral antinociceptive effect and suggest that this effect is mediated by the release of endogenous opioids.},

Previous studies have shown peripheral antinociception induced by endogenous opioid peptides released by these diterpenes. Considering that the activation of the opioid system leads to a noradrenaline release, the aim of this study was to verify the participation of the noradrenergic system in the peripheral antinociception induced by cafestol and kahweol. Hyperalgesia was induced by an intraplantar injection of prostaglandin E2 (2 µg). Cafestol or kahweol (80 µg/paw) were administered locally into the right hindpaw alone, and after the agents α 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (5, 10 and 20 µg/paw), α 2 A-adrenoceptor antagonist BRL 44 408 (40 µg/paw), α 2B-adrenoceptor antagonist imiloxan (40 µg/paw), α 2 C-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine (10, 15 and 20 µg/paw), α 2D-adrenoceptor antagonist RX 821 002 (40 µg/paw), α 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.5, 1 and 2 µg/paw), or β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (150, 300 and 600 ng/paw), respectively. Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor reboxetine (30 µg/paw) was administered prior to cafestol or kahweol low dose (40 µg/paw) and guanetidine 3 days prior to the experiment (30 mg/kg, once a day), depleting the noradrenaline storage. Intraplantar injection of cafestol or kahweol (80 µg/paw) induced a peripheral antinociception against hyperalgesia induced by PGE2. This effect was reversed by intraplantar injections of yohimbine, rauwolscine, prazosin and propranolol. Reboxetine injection intensified the antinociceptive effect of cafestol or kahweol low-dose, and guanethidine reversed almost 70 \% of the cafestol or kahweol-induced peripheral antinociception. This study gives evidence that the noradrenergic system participates in cafestol and kahweol-induced peripheral antinociception with the release of endogenous noradrenaline.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Avocado pear (Persea americana Mill.) leaves and seeds are used in traditional medicine for the treatment/management of Alzheimer disease (AD); however, information on the mechanism of actions is limited. This study sought to investigate the effect of P. americana leaf and seed aqueous extracts on some enzymes linked with AD (acetylcholinesterase [AChE] and butyrylcholinesterase [BChE] activities) and their antioxidant potentials in vitro.
METHODS: The inhibitory effects of extracts on AChE and BChE activities and antioxidant potentials (inhibition of Fe2+- and sodium nitroprusside-induced thiobarbiturate reactive species [TBARS] production in rat brain homogenates, radicals [1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, hydroxyl, and nitric oxide] scavenging and iron [Fe] chelation abilities) were investigated. Phenolic content and phytochemical screening were carried out. Alkaloid profile was also determined using gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization detector (GC-FID).
RESULTS: The extracts inhibited AChE and BChE activities and prooxidant-induced TBARS production in a dose-dependent manner, with the seed extract having the highest inhibitory effect and the leaf extract exhibiting higher phenolic content and radical scavenging abilities, but lower Fe chelation ability compared with that of the seed. The phytochemical screening revealed the presence of saponins, alkaloids, and terpenoids in both extracts, whereas the total alkaloid profile was higher in the seed extract than in the leaf extract, as revealed by GC-FID.
CONCLUSIONS: The anti-cholinesterase and antioxidant activities of avocado leaf and seed could be linked to their phytoconstituents and might be the possible mechanisms underlying their use as a cheap and natural treatment/management of AD. However, these extracts should be further investigated in vivo.},

	abstract = {Although the composition of the gut microbiota is of interest, the functionality, or metabolic activity, of the gut microbiota is of equal importance: the gut microbiota can produce either harmful metabolites associated with human disease or beneficial metabolites that protect against disease. The purposes of this study were to determine the associations between dietary intake variables and fecal short and branched chain fatty acid (S/BCFA) concentrations; to determine the associations between dietary intake variables and inulin degradation, short and branched chain fatty acid (S/BCFA) production, and ammonia production during in vitro fecal fermentation of a highly fermentable substrate (inulin); and finally to compare results from the fermentation of inulin with those obtained in a previous report using a poorly fermentable substrate (whole wheat; Yang and Rose, Nutr. Res., 2014, 34, 749-759). Stool samples from eighteen individuals that had completed one-year dietary records were used in an in vitro fecal fermentation system with long-chain inulin as substrate. Few dietary intake variables were correlated with fecal S/BCFA concentrations; however, intakes of several plant-based foods, especially whole grain, dry beans, and certain vegetables that provided dietary fiber, plant protein, and B vitamins, were associated with acetate, propionate, butyrate, and total SCFA production during inulin fermentation. In contrast, intake of dairy and processed meats that provided cholesterol and little fiber, were associated with ammonia and BCFA production. Comparing results between inulin and whole wheat fermentations, significant correlations were only found for butyrate and BCFA, suggesting that regardless of the type of carbohydrate provided to the microbiota, long-term diet may have a pronounced effect on the propensity of the gut microbiota toward either beneficial metabolism (butyrate production) or detrimental metabolism (BCFA production). These results may help in the development of new dietary strategies to improve gut microbiota functionality to promote human health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence suggests a cardioprotective role of α-linolenic acid (ALA), a plant-derived ω-3 fatty acid. It is unclear whether ALA is beneficial in a background of high marine ω-3 fatty acids (long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) intake. In persons at high cardiovascular risk from Spain, a country in which fish consumption is customarily high, we investigated whether meeting the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids recommendation for dietary ALA (0.7\% of total energy) at baseline was related to all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. We also examined the effect of meeting the society's recommendation for long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (≥500 mg/day).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We longitudinally evaluated 7202 participants in the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) trial. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios. ALA intake correlated to walnut consumption (r=0.94). During a 5.9-y follow-up, 431 deaths occurred (104 cardiovascular disease, 55 coronary heart disease, 32 sudden cardiac death, 25 stroke). The hazard ratios for meeting ALA recommendation (n=1615, 22.4\%) were 0.72 (95\% CI 0.56-0.92) for all-cause mortality and 0.95 (95\% CI 0.58-1.57) for fatal cardiovascular disease. The hazard ratios for meeting the recommendation for long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n=5452, 75.7\%) were 0.84 (95\% CI 0.67-1.05) for all-cause mortality, 0.61 (95\% CI 0.39-0.96) for fatal cardiovascular disease, 0.54 (95\% CI 0.29-0.99) for fatal coronary heart disease, and 0.49 (95\% CI 0.22-1.01) for sudden cardiac death. The highest reduction in all-cause mortality occurred in participants meeting both recommendations (hazard ratio 0.63 [95\% CI 0.45-0.87]).
CONCLUSIONS: In participants without prior cardiovascular disease and high fish consumption, dietary ALA, supplied mainly by walnuts and olive oil, relates inversely to all-cause mortality, whereas protection from cardiac mortality is limited to fish-derived long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Prodigest® is the standardized combination of artichoke and ginger extracts. This combination was safe and effective in the treatment of functional dyspepsia. However, further evidence could be useful to shed new lights on the effect of Prodigest® on gastric motility. This pilot randomized study on healthy volunteers investigates the prokinetic activity of Prodigest®.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a randomized, cross-over study in healthy volunteers comparing Prodigest® versus placebo. Eleven healthy volunteers were enrolled. Each participant underwent two evaluations, at a 7-day interval. Ten minutes before the main meal, the baseline area of gastric volume was determined by ultrasonography. The subject was then given one Prodigest® or placebo capsule and, then consumed a standardized meal. One hour after the meal, the gastric volume was measured again. Two weeks after the second evaluation, three subjects repeated the above-mentioned procedures taking two capsules of Prodigest®.
RESULTS: The mean gastric area at baseline was 3.2 ± 0.5 cm(2); after the meal, this figure was 8.4 ± 0.7 cm(2) with Prodigest® and 11.0 ± 1.5 cm2 with placebo (p{\textless}0.001). The after-meal gastric area was significantly smaller, with a -24\% difference, following the combination of extracts, as compared with placebo (p{\textless}0.001). The effect of two capsules of Prodigest® seems to be more evident but due to the very small number of the patients sample further clinical data are necessary before confirming the dose-related effects.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that Prodigest®, a standardized extract of ginger and artichoke, significantly promotes gastric emptying in healthy volunteers without being associated with notable adverse effects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence of anticancer properties of garlic for different cancer sites has been reported previously in in vitro and in vivo experimental studies but there is limited epidemiologic evidence on the association between garlic and lung cancer.
METHODS: We examined the association between raw garlic consumption and lung cancer in a case-control study conducted between 2005 and 2007 in Taiyuan, China. Epidemiologic data was collected by face-to-face interviews from 399 incident lung cancer cases and 466 healthy controls. We used unconditional logistic regression models to estimate crude and adjusted ORs (aOR) and their 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Adjusted models controlled for age, sex, average annual household income 10 years ago, smoking, and indoor air pollution.
RESULTS: Compared with no intake, raw garlic intake was associated with lower risk of development of lung cancer with a dose-response pattern (aOR for {\textless}2 times/week = 0.56; 95\% CI, 0.39-0.81 and aOR for ≥2 times/week = 0.50; 95\% CI, 0.34-0.74; Ptrend = 0.0002). Exploratory analysis showed an additive interaction of raw garlic consumption with indoor air pollution and with any supplement use in association with lung cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest that raw garlic consumption is associated with reduced risk of lung cancer in a Chinese population.
IMPACT: This study contributes to the limited research in human population on the association between garlic and lung cancer and advocates further investigation into the use of garlic in chemoprevention of lung cancer. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(4); 624-33. ©2016 AACR.},

	abstract = {Enhancing antiviral host defense responses through nutritional supplementation would be an attractive strategy in the fight against influenza. Using inoculation with live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) as an infection model, we have recently shown that ingestion of sulforaphane-containing broccoli sprout homogenates (BSH) reduces markers of viral load in the nose. To investigate the systemic effects of short-term BSH supplementation in the context of LAIV-inoculation, we examined peripheral blood immune cell populations in non-smoking subjects from this study, with a particular focus on NK cells. We carried out a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study measuring the effects of BSH (N = 13) or placebo (alfalfa sprout homogenate, ASH; N = 16) on peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses to a standard nasal vaccine dose of LAIV in healthy volunteers. Blood was drawn prior to (day-1) and post (day2, day21) LAIV inoculation and analyzed for neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, T cells, NKT cells, and NK cells. In addition, NK cells were enriched, stimulated, and assessed for surface markers, intracellular markers, and cytotoxic potential by flow cytometry. Overall, LAIV significantly reduced NKT (day2 and day21) and T cell (day2) populations. LAIV decreased NK cell CD56 and CD158b expression, while significantly increasing CD16 expression and cytotoxic potential (on day2). BSH supplementation further increased LAIV-induced granzyme B production (day2) in NK cells compared to ASH and in the BSH group granzyme B levels appeared to be negatively associated with influenza RNA levels in nasal lavage fluid cells. We conclude that nasal influenza infection may induce complex changes in peripheral blood NK cell activation, and that BSH increases virus-induced peripheral blood NK cell granzyme B production, an effect that may be important for enhanced antiviral defense responses.

	abstract = {Exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a causative factor in skin photodamage and carcinogenesis, and an urgent need exists for improved molecular photoprotective strategies different from (or synergistic with) photon absorption. Recent studies suggest a photoprotective role of cutaneous gene expression orchestrated by the transcription factor NRF2 (nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2). Here we have explored the molecular mechanism underlying carotenoid-based systemic skin photoprotection in SKH-1 mice and provide genetic evidence that photoprotection achieved by the FDA-approved apocarotenoid and food additive bixin depends on NRF2 activation. Bixin activates NRF2 through the critical Cys-151 sensor residue in KEAP1, orchestrating a broad cytoprotective response in cultured human keratinocytes as revealed by antioxidant gene expression array analysis. Following dose optimization studies for cutaneous NRF2 activation by systemic administration of bixin, feasibility of bixin-based suppression of acute cutaneous photodamage from solar UV exposure was investigated in Nrf2(+/+) versus Nrf2(-/-) SKH-1 mice. Systemic administration of bixin suppressed skin photodamage, attenuating epidermal oxidative DNA damage and inflammatory responses in Nrf2(+/+) but not in Nrf2(-/-) mice, confirming the NRF2-dependence of bixin-based cytoprotection. Taken together, these data demonstrate feasibility of achieving NRF2-dependent cutaneous photoprotection by systemic administration of the apocarotenoid bixin, a natural food additive consumed worldwide.},

Sixty Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into six groups: normal group, exercise group, exercise and verbascoside (0.1mg/kg)-treated group, exercise and verbascoside (1mg/kg)-treated group, exercise and verbascoside (10mg/kg)-treated group, exercise and caffeine (10mg/kg)-treated group. In exercise groups, rats were put on treadmill and forced to run for 30min once a day for 6 consecutive days. On the 7th day of the experiment, the time to exhaustion in treadmill exercise was determined for the trained groups. Immediately after the determination of the exhaustion time, all rats were sacrificed. 5-HT concentrations were detected by HPLC analysis. TPH2 and 5-HT1B protein expression were measured by western blot analysis. We found that verbascoside could prolong the time to exhaustion in treadmill exercise and suppress the exercise-induced increase of 5-HT synthesis and TPH2 protein expression, and prevent the exercise-induced decrease of 5-HT1B protein expression in the caudate putamen. Verbascoside was found as effective as caffeine in these effects. Verbascoside at 10mg/kg improved endurance of exercised rats. The mechanism of verbascoside' s anti-fatigue activity might be related to the inhibition of the exercise-induced synthesis of 5-HT and TPH2 expression, and to the increase of the 5-HT1B expression in the caudate putamen of exercised rats.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coffee, a source of antioxidants, has controversial effects on cardiovascular health.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the bioavailability of chlorogenic acids (CGAs) in 2 coffees and the effects of their consumption on the plasma antioxidant capacity (AC), the serum lipid profile, and the vascular function in healthy adults.
METHODS: Thirty-eight men and 37 women with a mean ± SD age of 38.5 ± 9 y and body mass index of 24.1 ± 2.6 kg/m(2) were randomly assigned to 3 groups: a control group that did not consume coffee or a placebo and 2 groups that consumed 400 mL coffee/d for 8 wk containing a medium (MCCGA; 420 mg) or high (HCCGA; 780 mg) CGA content. Both were low in diterpenes (0.83 mg/d) and caffeine (193 mg/d). Plasma caffeic and ferulic acid concentrations were measured by GC, and the plasma AC was evaluated with use of the ferric-reducing antioxidant power method. The serum lipid profile, nitric oxide (NO) plasma metabolites, vascular endothelial function (flow-mediated dilation; FMD), and blood pressure (BP) were evaluated.
RESULTS: After coffee consumption (1 h and 8 wk), caffeic and ferulic acid concentrations increased in the coffee-drinking groups, although the values of the 2 groups were significantly different (P {\textless} 0.001); caffeic and ferulic acid concentrations were undetectable in the control group. At 1 h after consumption, the plasma AC in the control group was significantly lower than the baseline value (-2\%) and significantly increased in the MCCGA (6\%) and HCCGA (5\%) groups (P {\textless} 0.05). After 8 wk, no significant differences in the lipid, FMD, BP, or NO plasma metabolite values were observed between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Both coffees, which contained CGAs and were low in diterpenes and caffeine, provided bioavailable CGAs and had a positive acute effect on the plasma AC in healthy adults and no effect on blood lipids or vascular function. The group that did not drink coffee showed no improvement in serum lipid profile, FMD, BP, or NO plasma metabolites. This trial was registered at registroclinico.sld.cu as RPCEC00000168.},

	abstract = {Leptin is mainly secreted by white adipose tissue and regulates energy homeostasis by inhibiting food intake and stimulating energy expenditure through its action in neuronal circuits in the brain, particularly in the hypothalamus. However, hyperleptinemia coexists with the loss of responsiveness to leptin in common obese conditions. This phenomenon has been defined as leptin resistance and the restoration of leptin sensitivity is considered to be a useful strategy to treat obesity. This review summarizes the existing literature on potentially valuable nutrients and food components to reverse leptin resistance. Notably, several food compounds, such as teasaponins, resveratrol, celastrol, caffeine, and taurine among others, are able to restore the leptin signaling in neurons by overexpressing anorexigenic peptides (proopiomelanocortin) and/or repressing orexigenic peptides (neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide), thus decreasing food intake. Additionally, some nutrients, such as vitamins A and D, can improve leptin transport through the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, food components can improve leptin resistance by acting at different levels of the leptin pathway; moreover, some compounds are able to target more than one feature of leptin resistance. However, systematic studies are necessary to define the actual effectiveness of each compound.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: N(ε)-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) is one of the major advanced glycation end products in both diabetics and nondiabetics. CML depositions in the microvasculature have recently been linked to the aetiology of acute myocardial infarction and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease, possibly related to local enhancement of inflammation and oxidative processes. We hypothesized that CML deposition in the microvasculature of the heart and brain is age-induced and that it could be inhibited by a diet intervention with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative actions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ApoE(-/-) mice (n = 50) were fed a Western diet and were sacrificed after 40, 70 and 90 weeks. Part of these mice (n = 20) were fed a Western diet enriched with DHA from 40 weeks on. CML in cardiac and cerebral microvessels was quantified using immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Cardiac microvascular depositions of CML significantly increased with an immunohistochemical score of 11·85 [5·92-14·60] at 40 weeks, to 33·17 [17·60-47·15] at 70 weeks (P = 0·005). At the same time points, cerebral microvascular CML increased from 6·45; [4·78-7·30] to 12·99; [9·85-20·122] (P = 0·003). DHA decreased CML in the intramyocardial vasculature at both 70 and 90 weeks, significant at 70 weeks [33·17; (17·60-47·15) vs. 14·73; (4·44-28·16) P = 0·037]. No such effects were found in the brain.
CONCLUSIONS: Accumulation of N(ε)-(carboxymethyl)lysine in the cerebral and cardiac microvasculature is age-induced and is prevented by DHA in the intramyocardial vessels of ApoE(-/-) mice.},

Prunetin, a representative isoflavone, was recently found to affect cell signaling in cultured cells; however, in vivo effects remain elusive. In this study, the model organism Drosophila melanogaster was used to investigate the effects of prunetin in vivo with respect to lifespan, locomotion, body composition, metabolism, and gut health. Adult flies were chronically administered a prunetin-supplemented diet. Prunetin improved median survival by 3 d, and climbing activity increased by 54\% in males. In comparison with the females, male flies exhibited lower climbing activity, which was reversed by prunetin intake. Furthermore, prunetin-fed males exhibited increased expression of the longevity gene Sirtuin 1 (Sir2) (22\%), as well as elevated AMPK activation (51\%) and triglyceride levels (29\%), whereas glucose levels decreased (36\%). As females are long-lived compared with their male counterparts and exhibit higher triglyceride levels, prunetin apparently "feminizes" male flies via its estrogenicity. We conclude that the lifespan-prolonging effects of prunetin in the male fruit fly depend on changes in AMPK-regulated energy homeostasis via male "feminization." Collectively, we identified prunetin as a plant bioactive compound capable of improving health status and survival in male D. melanogaster.},

	abstract = {Articular cartilage has poor capability for repair following trauma or degenerative pathology due to avascular property, low cell density and migratory ability. Discovery of novel therapeutic approaches for articular cartilage repair remains a significant clinical need. Hypoxia is a hallmark for cartilage development and pathology. Hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1α) has been identified as a key mediator for chondrocytes to response to fluctuations of oxygen availability during cartilage development or repair. This suggests that HIF-1α may serve as a target for modulating chondrocyte functions. In this study, using phenotypic cellular screen assays, we identify that Icariin, an active flavonoid component from Herba Epimedii, activates HIF-1α expression in chondrocytes. We performed systemic in vitro and in vivo analysis to determine the roles of Icariin in regulation of chondrogenesis. Our results show that Icariin significantly increases hypoxia responsive element luciferase reporter activity, which is accompanied by increased accumulation and nuclear translocation of HIF-1α in murine chondrocytes. The phenotype is associated with inhibiting PHD activity through interaction between Icariin and iron ions. The upregulation of HIF-1α mRNA levels in chondrocytes persists during chondrogenic differentiation for 7 and 14 days. Icariin (10-6 M) increases the proliferation of chondrocytes or chondroprogenitors examined by MTT, BrdU incorporation or colony formation assays. Icariin enhances chondrogenic marker expression in a micromass culture including Sox9, collagen type 2 (Col2α1) and aggrecan as determined by real-time PCR and promotes extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis indicated by Alcian blue staining. ELISA assays show dramatically increased production of aggrecan and hydroxyproline in Icariin-treated cultures at day 14 of chondrogenic differentiation as compared with the controls. Meanwhile, the expression of chondrocyte catabolic marker genes including Mmp2, Mmp9, Mmp13, Adamts4 and Adamts5 was downregulated following Icariin treatment for 14 days. In a differentiation assay using bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) carrying HIF-1α floxed allele, the promotive effect of Icariin on chondrogenic differentiation is largely decreased following Cre recombinase-mediated deletion of HIF-1α in MSCs as indicated by Alcian blue staining for proteoglycan synthesis. In an alginate hydrogel 3D culture system, Icariin increases Safranin O positive (SO+) cartilage area. This phenotype is accompanied by upregulation of HIF-1α, increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive (PCNA+) cell numbers, SOX9+ chondrogenic cell numbers, and Col2 expression in the newly formed cartilage. Coincide with the micromass culture, Icariin treatment upregulates mRNA levels of Sox9, Col2α1, aggrecan and Col10α1 in the 3D cultures. We then generated alginate hydrogel 3D complexes incorporated with Icariin. The 3D complexes were transplanted in a mouse osteochondral defect model. ICRS II histological scoring at 6 and 12 weeks post-transplantation shows that 3D complexes incorporated with Icariin significantly enhance articular cartilage repair with higher scores particularly in selected parameters including SO+ cartilage area, subchondral bone and overall assessment than that of the controls. The results suggest that Icariin may inhibit PHD activity likely through competition for cellular iron ions and therefore it may serve as an HIF-1α activator to promote articular cartilage repair through regulating chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation and integration with subchondral bone formation.},

C+E) and of a combination of vit. C+E and gabapentin (100mg/kg/day, i.p.) on the mechanical and thermal thresholds of CCI rats. The vitamins, whether administered orally or i.p., attenuated the reductions in the mechanical and thermal thresholds induced by CCI. The antinociceptive effect was greater with a combination of vit. C+E than with each vitamin given alone. The SFI was also improved in vitamin-treated CCI rats. Co-administration of vit. C+E and gabapentin induced a greater antinociceptive effect than gabapentin alone. No significant change occurred in TAC and lipid hydroperoxide levels, but TAC increased (45\%) while lipid hydroperoxides decreased (38\%) in the sciatic nerve from vit. C+E-treated CCI rats. Thus, treatment with a combination of vit. C+E was more effective to treat CCI-induced neuropathic pain than vitamins alone, and the antinociceptive effect was greater with co-administration of vit. C+E and gabapentin than with gabapentin alone.},

	abstract = {Lysozyme is a bactericidal enzyme whose structure and functions change in diabetes. Chemical chaperones are small molecules including polyamines (e.g. spermine), amino acids (e.g. L-lysine) and polyols (e.g. glycerol). They can improve protein conformation in several stressful conditions such as glycation. In this study, the authors aimed to observe the effect of L-lysine as a chemical chaperone on structure and function of glycated lysozyme. In this study, in vitro and in vivo effects of L-lysine on lysozyme glycation were investigated. Lysozyme was incubated with glucose and/or L-lysine, followed by an investigation of its structure by electrophoresis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and circular dichroism spectroscopy and also assessment of its bactericidal activity against M. lysodeikticus. In the clinical trial, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were randomly divided into two groups of 25 (test and control). All patients received metformin and glibenclamide for a three months period. The test group was supplemented with 3 g/day of L-lysine. The quantity and activity of lysozyme and other parameters were then measured. Among the test group, L-lysine was found to reduce the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the sera of patients with T2DM and in vitro condition. This chemical chaperone reversed the alteration in lysozyme structure and function due to glycation and resulted in increased lysozyme activity. Structure and function of glycated lysozyme are significantly improved by l-lysine; therefore it can be considered an effective therapeutic supplementation in T2DM, decreasing the risk of infection in these patients.},

Therefore, we decided to determine the antidepressant-like effects of the standardized hydroalcoholic extract of Cocos nucifera husk fiber (HECN) as well as oxidative alterations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HC) and striatum (ST), and the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the HC of mice. The extract was characterized based on the content of total polyphenols as well as two phenol compounds-catechin and chlorogenic acid-by HPLC-PDA. Male animals were treated per os (p.o.) for 7 days with distilled water or HECN (50, 100 or 200 mg/kg), or intraperitoneally with vitamin E (Vit E 400 mg/kg). One hour after the last drug administration, the animals were submitted to the open field test, forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and, immediately after the behavioral tests, had their brain removed for neurochemical determinations. The results showed that HECN100 decreased the immobility time in the FST and TST presenting, thus demonstrating an antidepressant-like effect. The administration of HECN decreased malondialdehyde levels in all doses and brain areas studied with the exception of HECN50 in the HC. The administration of HECN also decreased nitrite levels in all doses and brain regions studied. HECN100 also increased the levels of BDNF in HC of mice. In conclusion, we demonstrated that HECN has antidepressant-like properties, probably based on its antioxidant and neurotrophic effects, and is thus relevant for the treatment of depression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal maternal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure leads to behavioral deficits such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia in the adult lives. LPS-exposure resulted in the production of cytokines and oxidative damage. On the contrary, astaxanthin is a carotenoid compound, showed neuroprotective properties via its antioxidant capacity. This study examines the effect of astaxanthin on the prenatal maternal LPS-induced postnatal behavioral deficit in mice.
RESULTS: We found that prenatal LPS-exposed mice showed extensive immobile phase in the tail suspension test, higher frequent head dipping in the hole-board test and greater hypolocomotion in the open field test. All these values were statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.05). In addition, a marked elevation of the level of lipid peroxidation, advanced protein oxidation product, nitric oxide, while a pronounced depletion of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione) were observed in the adult offspring mice that were prenatally exposed to LPS. To the contrary, 6-weeks long treatment with astaxanthin significantly improved all behavioral deficits (p {\textless} 0.05) and diminished prenatal LPS-induced oxidative stress markers in the brain and liver.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that prenatal maternal LPS-exposure leads to behavioral deficits in the adults, while astaxanthin ameliorates the behavioral deficits presumably via its antioxidant property.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Dietary intake of the natural omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been implicated in protecting patients with viral hepatitis B or C from developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Little is known about the effects of DHA on established solid tumors. Here we describe a low-density lipoprotein-based nanoparticle that acts as a transporter for unesterified DHA (LDL-DHA) and demonstrates selective cytotoxicity toward HCC cells. We investigated the ability of LDL-DHA to reduce growth of orthotopic hepatomas in rats.
METHODS: AxC-Irish (ACI) rats were given intrahepatic injections of rat hepatoma cells (H4IIE); 24 tumor-bearing rats (mean tumor diameter, ∼1 cm) were subject to a single hepatic artery injection of LDL nanoparticles (2 mg/kg) loaded with DHA (LDL-DHA), triolein (LDL-TO), or sham surgery controls. Tumor growth was measured by magnetic resonance imaging and other methods; tumor, liver, and serum samples were collected and assessed by histochemical, immunofluorescence, biochemical, and immunoblot analyses.
RESULTS: Three days after administration of LDL-TO or sham surgery, the control rats had large, highly vascularized tumors that contained proliferating cells. However, rats given LDL-DHA had smaller, pale tumors that were devoid of vascular supply and {\textgreater}80\% of the tumor tissue was necrotic. Four to 6 days after injection of LDL-DHA, the tumors were 3-fold smaller than those of control rats. The liver tissue that surrounded the tumors showed no histologic or biochemical evidence of injury. Injection of LDL-DHA into the hepatic artery of rats selectively deregulated redox reactions in tumor tissues by increasing levels of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, depleting and oxidizing glutathione and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and significantly down-regulating the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase-4. Remarkably, the redox balance in the surrounding liver was not disrupted.
CONCLUSION: LDL-DHA nanoparticle selectively kills hepatoma cells and reduces growth of orthotopic liver tumors in rats. It induces tumor-specific necrosis by selectively disrupting redox balance within the cancer cell.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Insulin resistance (IR) is a main pathophysiologic feature in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients which is triggered by elevated oxidative stress in these patients. Selenium, an essential micronutrient, is a major constituent of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase. Recently, decreased plasma selenium concentrations were reported in PCOS patients. So, the present study was carried out in order to assess whether selenium consumption can improve the metabolic response to insulin and reduce the insulin resistance in these women.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 53 PCOS patients (diagnosed by Rotterdam criteria), 18-42 years old, participated in this randomized, double-blind and placebo controlled trial for 12 weeks (selenium, n=26; placebo, n=27). The effects of daily administration of 200 μg selenium or placebo on serum glucose, total testosterone (tT), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and free androgen index (FAI) in fasting state were evaluated.
RESULTS: At the end of the study, insulin resistance was significantly increased in selenium recipients when compared with the placebo group (2.05 ± 0.39 when compared with 1.81 ± 0.25, p=0.017). Also, selenium supplementation resulted in marginally significant increase (p=0.056) in insulin level when compared with the placebo group. There were no statistically significant changes in other study endpoints, when comparing the two groups.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that selenium supplementation in PCOS patients may worsen insulin resistance in them. Until the results of larger studies become available, indiscriminate consumption of selenium supplements in PCOS patients will warrant caution.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary interventions as a means for atopy prevention attract great interest. Some studies in rural environments claimed an inverse association between consumption of farm-produced dairy products and the prevalence of allergic diseases, but current evidence is controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether consumption of farm-produced products is associated with a lower prevalence of asthma and allergy when compared with shop-purchased products.
METHODS: Cross sectional multi-centre study (PARSIFAL) including 14,893 children aged 5-13 years from five European countries (2823 from farm families and 4606 attending Steiner Schools as well as 5440 farm reference and 2024 Steiner reference children). A detailed questionnaire including a dietary component was completed and allergen-specific IgE was measured in serum.
RESULTS: Farm milk consumption ever in life showed a statistically significant inverse association with asthma: covariate adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.74 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.88], rhinoconjunctivitis: aOR 0.56 (0.43-0.73) and sensitization to pollen and the food mix fx5 (cut-off level of {\textgreater}or=3.5 kU/L): aOR 0.67 (0.47-0.96) and aOR 0.42 (0.19-0.92), respectively, and sensitization to horse dander: aOR 0.50 (95\% CI 0.28-0.87). The associations were observed in all four subpopulations and independent of farm-related co-exposures. Other farm-produced products were not independently related to any allergy-related health outcome.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that consumption of farm milk may offer protection against asthma and allergy. A deepened understanding of the relevant protective components of farm milk and a better insight into the biological mechanisms underlying this association are warranted as a basis for the development of a safe product for prevention.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether fat quality, in the context of meals with high- (HGI) or low-glycemic index (LGI), influences postprandial blood glucose (PPG) response in patients with type 1 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: According to a randomized crossover design, 13 patients with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump consumed two series (HGI or LGI) of meals with the same carbohydrate quantity while differing for amount and quality of fat: 1) low in fat ("low fat"), 2) high in saturated fat (butter), or 3) high in monounsaturated fat (extra-virgin olive oil) (EVOO). Premeal insulin doses were based on insulin-to-glycemic load ratios. Continuous glucose monitoring was performed and 6-h PPG evaluated.
RESULTS: PPG was significantly different between HGI and LGI meals (P = 0.005 for time × glycemic index interaction by repeated-measures analysis [RMA]), being significantly higher during the first 3 h after the HGI meals with a later tendency to an opposite pattern. In the context of HGI meals, PPG was significantly lower after EVOO than after low fat or butter (P {\textless} 0.0001 for time × meal interaction by RMA), with a marked difference in the 0- to 3-h glucose incremental area under the curve between EVOO (mean ± SD 198 ± 274 mmol/L × 180 min) and either low fat (416 ± 329) or butter (398 ± 355) (P {\textless} 0.05). No significant differences were observed in PPG between the three LGI meals.
CONCLUSIONS: Carbohydrate quality of a mixed meal influences shape and extent of PPG. Besides, using EVOO in a HGI meal attenuates the early postprandial glucose response observed when this meal is consumed with either low fat or butter. Therefore, an optimal prandial insulin administration would require considering, in addition to the quantity of carbohydrates, the quality of both carbohydrate and fat.},

	abstract = {SCOPE: Sorghum grain components may play a role in mechanisms that protect against development of obesity-related chronic diseases. We conducted a randomized, cross-over trial (40Â healthy subjects) using whole grain sorghum flaked biscuits to investigate mechanisms related to satiety.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects were tested on four occasions after a 12-h fast. At baseline, they consumed 50 grams of one of four treatment meals: white, red, or brown sorghum biscuits or a wheat control. Subjective satiety was measured at 8 time-points over four hours. In a subset of 20 subjects, plasma glucose, insulin, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide-tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), and ghrelin were measured. Subjects reported significantly lower subjective satiety ratings after consuming wheat compared to sorghum biscuits. Incremental area under the plasma concentration-time curve of postprandial GLP-1, GIP and in males, PYY, were significantly higher (p = 0.018, p = 0.031, p = 0.036, respectively) for sorghum breakfasts compared to wheat. Energy intake at a subsequent meal did not differ between treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Sorghum whole grain is a promising novel ingredient in foods targeting satiety as an adjunct for weight control. Evidence is now required from randomized controlled trials that aim to examine specific effects on health outcomes from a sorghum-enriched intervention diet.},

	abstract = {We report the case of a 48-year-old man who achieved a complete molecular remission 20 years after a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia while using epigallicatechin-3-gallate, an extract of green tea. The patient presented at age 28 with lymphocytosis, mild anemia, mild thrombocytopenia, and massive splenomegaly, for which a splenectomy was performed. He was then followed expectantly. Over the next two decades, he suffered two symptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia-related events. The first occurred twelve years after diagnosis (at age 40) when the patient developed fevers, night sweats, and moderate anemia. He was diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia secondary to chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The patient declined conventional therapy in favor of a diet, exercise, and supplement regimen, and recovered from the autoimmune hemolytic anemia though the underlying chronic lymphocytic leukemia remained evident. This is the first published case report of "spontaneous" recovery from secondary autoimmune hemolytic anemia in an adult.  Over the second decade following chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosis, serial bone marrow biopsies demonstrated increasing lymphocytosis, with minimal peripheral lymphocytosis. However, twenty years after diagnosis, peripheral lymphocytosis accelerated, with white blood cell counts rising to 55,000/µL. Because the patient continued to refuse conventional therapy, he was treated instead with a supplement regimen that included high doses of epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a green tea extract. Peripheral lymphocytosis resolved. More remarkably, a bone marrow examination, including flow cytometry, showed no evidence of a malignant clone. Two years later (at age 51), the peripheral blood and bone marrow were without molecular evidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or any malignancy. The patient remains well at age 52.},

We evaluated the likelihood of t-CA to influence metabolism by inhibition of P450 enzymes. IC50 values from recombinant enzymes indicated that an interaction is most probable for CYP2A6 (IC50 = 6.1 µM). t-CA was 10.5-fold more selective for human CYP2A6 than for CYP2E1; IC50 values for P450s 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 were 15.8-fold higher or more. t-CA is a type I ligand for CYP2A6 (KS = 14.9 µM). Inhibition of CYP2A6 by t-CA was metabolism-dependent; inhibition required NADPH and increased with time. Glutathione lessened the extent of inhibition modestly and statistically significantly. The carbon monoxide binding spectrum was dramatically diminished after exposure to NADPH and t-CA, suggesting degradation of the heme or CYP2A6 apoprotein. Using a static model and mechanism-based inhibition parameters (K(I) = 18.0 µM; k(inact) = 0.056 minute(-1)), changes in the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for nicotine and letrozole were predicted in the presence of t-CA (0.1 and 1 µM). The AUC fold-change ranged from 1.1 to 3.6. In summary, t-CA is a potential source of pharmacokinetic variability for CYP2A6 substrates due to metabolism-dependent inhibition, especially in scenarios when exposure to t-CA is elevated due to high dietary exposure, or when cinnamon is used as a treatment of specific disease states (e.g., diabetes).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Some studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of Spirulina maxima (Arthrospira maxima) consumption on glycemic, lipid, and blood pressure parameters. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Spirulina maxima on body weight, blood pressure, and endothelial function.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 40 patients with hypertension but lacking evidence of cardiovascular disease were enrolled to receive daily either 2.0 g Hawaiian spirulina or placebo for three months. Anthropometric parameters, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and stiffness index (SI) using digital plethysmography were measured before and after the intervention.
RESULTS: After three months, there was no change in body mass index (BMI) or weight in either the spirulina or the placebo group. However, a significant reduction in SBP and SI was observed. The patients in the spirulina group showed significant reductions in BMI (26.9 ± 3.1 vs. 25.0 ± 2.7 kg/m(2), p = 0.0032), weight (75.5 ± 11.8 vs. 70.5 ± 10.3 kg, p {\textless} 0.001), SBP (149 ± 7 vs. 143 ± 9 mmHg, p = 0.0023), and SI (7.2 ± 0.6 vs. 6.9 ± 0.7 m/s, p {\textless} 0.001). The tested parameters did not change in the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that three months of regular consumption of Spirulina maxima not only improves BMI and weight but also results in improvements in blood pressure and endothelial function spirulina in overweight patients with hypertension but lacking evidence of cardiovascular disease.},

In experiment 1, 50 rats were given PL (n = 22) or CR (n = 22) and a non-supplemented, non-inoculated group served as control CT (n = 6), for 40 days, and the survival rate and tumor mass were assessed. In experiment 2, 25 rats were given CR or PL for 15 days and sacrificed for biochemical analysis. Again, a non-supplemented, non-inoculated group served as control (CT; n = 6). Tumor and muscle creatine kinase (CK) activity and total creatine content, acidosis, inflammatory cytokines, and antioxidant capacity were assessed. Tumor growth was significantly reduced by approximately 30 \% in CR when compared with PL (p = 0.03), although the survival rate was not significantly different between CR and PL (p = 0.65). Tumor creatine content tended to be higher in CR than PL (p = 0.096). Tumor CK activity in the cytosolic fraction was higher in CR than PL (p {\textless} 0.0001). Blood pCO2 was higher in CT and CR than PL (p = 0.0007 and p = 0.004, respectively). HCO3 was augmented in CT compared to PL (p = 0.03) and CR (p = 0.001). Plasma IL-6 was lower and IL-10 level was higher in CR than PL (p = 0.03 and p = 0.0007, respectively) and TNF-alpha featured a tendency of decrease in CR compared to PL (p = 0.08). Additionally, total antioxidant capacity tended to be lower in CT than PL (p = 0.07). Creatine supplementation was able to slow tumor growth without affecting the overall survival rate, probably due to the re-establishment of the CK-creatine system in cancer cells, leading to attenuation in acidosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress. These findings support the role of creatine as a putative anti-cancer agent as well as help in expanding our knowledge on its potential mechanisms of action in malignancies.},

This work explored the effects of a commercially available beetroot supplement on metabolism, gene expression, and mitochondrial content in cultured myocytes. C2C12 myocytes were treated with various concentrations of the beetroot supplement for various durations. Glycolytic metabolism and oxidative metabolism were quantified via measurement of extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption, respectively. Metabolic gene expression was measured using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and mitochondrial content was assessed with flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Cells treated with beetroot exhibited significantly increased oxidative metabolism, concurrently with elevated metabolic gene expression including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha, nuclear respiratory factor 1, mitochondrial transcription factor A, and glucose transporter 4, leading to increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Our data show that treatment with a beetroot supplement increases basal oxidative metabolism. Our observations are also among the first to demonstrate that beetroot extract is an inducer of metabolic gene expression and mitochondrial biogenesis. These observations support the need for further investigation into the therapeutic and pharmacological effects of nitrate-containing supplements for health and athletic benefits.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Gabolysat PC60 is a fish protein hydrolysate with anxiolytic properties commonly used as a nutritional supplement.
OBJECTIVE: The diazepam-like effects of PC60 on stress responsiveness of the rat pituitary-adrenal system and on sympathoadrenal activity were studied.
METHODS: The activity of the pituitary-adrenal axis, measured by plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (B) of the sympathoadrenal complex, measured by circulating levels of noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A), and the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) content in the hippocampus and the hypothalamus were investigated in male rats which received daily, by an intragastric feeding tube, for 5 days running either diazepam (1 mg/kg) or PC60 (300 or 1,200 mg/kg). Controls received only solvent (carboxymethylcellulose 1\%). Six hours after the last force-feeding, the rats were subjected to 3 min ether inhalation or 30 min restraint and killed by decapitation 30 min after ether stress or at the end of restraint.
RESULTS: Baseline plasma levels of ACTH, B, NA and A were not affected by either diazepam or PC60. Both ether- and restraint-induced release of ACTH, but not B, were similarly and drastically reduced by diazepam and PC60 (1,200 mg/kg). Both diazepam and PC60 (1,200 mg/kg) deleted restraint-induced NA and A increases. Both treatments also reduced the ether-induced rise of A. Basal levels of GABA were significantly increased in both the hippocampus and the hypothalamus in PC60-treated rats and only in the hippocampus in diazepam-treated ones. In controls, ether inhalation as well as restraint increased GABA content of these two brain structures. In contrast, such stress procedures performed in PC60-treated rats reduced GABA content slightly in the hippocampus but significantly in the hypothalamus. In diazepam-treated rats, GABA content of the hypothalamus was unaffected by stresses but that of the hippocampus was slightly decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: Present data suggest diazepam-like effects of PC60 on stress responsiveness of the rat pituitary adrenal axis and the sympathoadrenal activity as well as GABA content of the hippocampus and the hypothalamus under resting and stress conditions. These effects of PC60 agree with anxiolytic properties of this nutritional supplement, previously reported in both rats and humans.},

De-pigmenting activity of RD was discovered and it was used as a brightening ingredient for the skin whitening cosmetics. Recently, cosmetics containing RD were withdrawn from the market because a number of consumers developed leukoderma, inflammation and erythema on their face, neck and hands. Here, we explored the mechanism underlying the toxicity of RD and RK against melanocytes using B16F10 murine melanoma cells and human primary epidermal melanocytes. Treatment with RD or RK resulted in the decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner which appeared from cell growth arrest. Consistently, ROS generation was significantly increased by RD or RK as determined by DCF-enhanced fluorescence. An antioxidant enzyme, glutathione peroxidase was depleted as well. In line with ROS generation, oxidative damages and the arrest of normal cell proliferation, GADD genes (Growth Arrest and DNA Damage) that include GADD45 and GADD153, were significantly up-regulated. Prevention of ROS generation with an anti-oxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly rescued RD and RK-suppressed melanocyte proliferation. Consistently, up-regulation of GADD45 and GADD153 was significantly attenuated by NAC, suggesting that increased ROS and the resultant growth arrest of melanocytes may contribute to RD and RK-induced leukoderma.},

Fasted mice treated with Ethanol 99.9\% (0.2 ml/animal, p.o.) received previously AEL (0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10 or 50 mg/kg, i.v.), saline (5 ml/kg; i.v.) or ranitidine (80 mg/kg, p.o.) in four experimental series, in which pharmacological tools (yohimbine, naloxone, L-NAME or indomethacin), were administered with the purpose of make clear possible molecular action mechanisms. Mice were euthanized 30 min after ethanol challenge to verify the stomach damages. Establishment of gastric oxidative stress, tissue hemoglobin (Hb) content and microscopic features (H\&amp;E) were taken in order to characterize the AEL gastro protective effect. AEL (1 mg/kg) was capable of protect mucosa against ethanol damages in presence of two (L-NAME and indomethacin) of four antagonists/inhibitors used. The AEL effect was reversed by naloxone and yohimbine, showing the involvement of opioids and Αlpha-2 adrenergic receptors on gastric protective effect of this lectin. Evaluation of microscopic features, oxidative stress, and Hb levels pointed the protective effects of AEL. This activity seems to be mediated by alpha-2 adrenergic and opioid receptors activation. Nitric oxide or prostaglandins were not involved. AEL simultaneously showed antioxidant effect that is probably implicated in its intricate defensive mechanism of action.},

Objective To compare the toxicity flavokawains A and B (FKA, FKB) and monitor the resulting transcriptional responses and cellular adaptation in the human hepatocyte cell line, HepG2. Materials and methods HepG2 were treated with 2-100 μM FKA or FKB for 24-48 h. Cellular viability was measured with calcein-AM and changes in signalling and gene expression were monitored by luciferase reporter assay, real-time PCR and Western blot of both total and nuclear protein extracts. To test for subsequent resistance to oxidative stress, cells were pretreated with 50 μM FKA, 10 μM FKB or 10 μM sulphoraphane (SFN) for 24 h, followed by 0.4-2.8 mM H2O2 for 48 h, and then viability was assessed. Results FKA (≤100 μM) was not toxic to HepG2, whereas FKB caused significant cell death (IC50=23.2 ± 0.8 μM). Both flavokawains activated Nrf2, increasing HMOX1 and GCLC expression and enhancing total glutathione levels over 2-fold (p {\textless} 0.05). FKA and FKB also activated HSF1, increasing HSPA1A and DNAJA4 expression. Also, flavokawain pretreatment mitigated cell death after a subsequent challenge with H2O2, with FKA being more effective than FKB, and similar to SFN. Conclusions Flavokawains promote an adaptive cellular response that protects hepatocytes against oxidative stress.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Daily consumption of Concord grape juice (CGJ) over 3-4 mo has been shown to improve memory function in adults with mild cognitive impairment and reduce blood pressure in hypertensive adults. These benefits likely result from the high concentration of polyphenols in CGJ. Increased stress can impair cognitive function and elevate blood pressure. Thus, we examined the potential beneficial effect of CGJ in individuals with somewhat stressful and demanding lifestyles.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the effects of the daily consumption of CGJ for 12 wk on cognitive function, driving performance, and blood pressure in healthy, middle-aged working mothers.
DESIGN: Twenty-five healthy mothers (aged 40-50 y) of preteen children who were employed for â‰¥30 h/wk consumed 12 ounces (355 mL) of either CGJ (containing 777 mg total polyphenols) or an energy-, taste-, and appearance-matched placebo daily for 12 wk according to a randomized crossover design with a 4-wk washout. Verbal and spatial memory, executive function, attention, blood pressure, and mood were assessed at baseline and at 6 and 12 wk. Immediately after the cognitive battery, a subsample of 17 women completed a driving performance assessment at the University of Leeds Driving Simulator. The 25-min driving task required participants to match the speed and direction of a lead vehicle.
RESULTS: Significant improvements in immediate spatial memory and driving performance were observed after CGJ relative to placebo. There was evidence of an enduring effect of CGJ such that participants who received CGJ in arm 1 maintained better performance in the placebo arm.
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive benefits associated with the long-term consumption of flavonoid-rich grape juice are not exclusive to adults with mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, these cognitive benefits are apparent in complex everyday tasks such as driving. Effects may persist beyond the cessation of flavonoid consumption, and future studies should carefully consider the length of washout within crossover designs.

Plasma HT instability and low concentrations have been major limitations for its quantification in clinical studies. Here, we describe a method to detect and quantify free HT in human plasma by using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The method encompasses different steps of sample preparation including plasma stabilization, protein precipitation, selective derivatization with benzylamine, and purification by solid-phase extraction. A high sensitivity (LOD, 0.3ng/mL), specificity and stability of HT is achieved following these procedures. The method was validated and its applicability was demonstrated by analyzing human plasma samples after olive oil intake. A pharmacokinetic comparison was performed measuring free HT plasma concentrations following the intake of 25mL of ordinary olive oil (nearly undetectable concentrations) versus an extra-virgin olive oil (Cmax=4.40ng/mL). To our knowledge, this is the first time that an analytical procedure for quantifying free HT in plasma after olive oil dietary doses has been reported. The present methodology opens the door to a better understanding of the relationship between HT plasma concentrations and its beneficial health effects.},

	abstract = {Although arctigenin (ARC) has been reported to have some pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, and antioxidant, there have been no reports on the anti-obesity effect of ARC. The aim of this study is to investigate whether ARC has an anti-obesity effect and mediates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. We investigated the anti-adipogenic effect of ARC using 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs). In high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice, whether ARC can inhibit weight gain was investigated. We found that ARC reduced weight gain, fat pad weight, and triglycerides in HFD-induced obese mice. ARC also inhibited the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα) in in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ARC induced the AMPK activation resulting in down-modulation of adipogenesis-related factors including PPARγ, C/EBPα, fatty acid synthase, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, and lipoprotein lipase. This study demonstrates that ARC can reduce key adipogenic factors by activating the AMPK in vitro and in vivo and suggests a therapeutic implication of ARC for obesity treatment. J. Cell.

	abstract = {Chemical modification of histones represents an important epigenetic mechanism critical for DNA metabolism including, transcription, replication and repair. A well-known example is maintenance of histone acetylation status by the opposing actions of histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase enzymes which add and remove acetyl groups on lysine residues on histone tails, respectively. Similarly, histone methyltransferase and histone demethylase enzymes are responsible for adding and removing methyl groups on histone tails, respectively. Further, there is accumulated evidence indicating a histone code where combinations of different chemical modifications on histone tails act in concert to regulate DNA metabolic events. Although numerous compounds have been developed to specifically alter the function of chromatin modifying enzymes (for example, histone deacetylase inhibitors are relatively well-investigated), we are only at the early stages of understanding the epigenetic effects of dietary compounds. Here we used in silico molecular modeling approaches combined with known experimental affinities for controls, to identify potential chromatin modifying compounds derived from Olea Europaea. Our findings indicate that various compounds derived from Olea Europaea have the ability to bind to the active site of different chromatin modifying enzymes, with an affinity analogous or higher than that for a known positive control. Further, we initiated the process of validating targets using in vitro binding and enzyme activity inhibition assays and provide initial findings of potential epigenetic effects in a clinical context. Overall, our findings can be considered as the first instalment of a comprehensive endeavour to catalogue and detail the epigenetic effects of compounds derived from Olea Europaea.},

Germination of legumes increases the plant levels of melatonin, making sprouts a suitable food source of this hormone. However, information on its bioavailability after consumption is lacking. We aimed to evaluate in rats the effect of kidney bean sprout intake on the plasma levels of melatonin and metabolically related compounds (serotonin, 6-sulfatoxymelatonin), total phenolic compounds and total antioxidant capacity. In addition, we compared the plasma bioavailability derived from kidney bean sprouts versus synthetic melatonin intake. Kidney beans were germinated for 6 days and an extract was prepared in water. Male young Sprague Dawley rats were used; blood and urine samples were obtained before and after 90 min of administration of kidney bean sprout extract via a gavage. The plasmatic melatonin levels increased after sprout ingestion (16\%, p {\textless} 0.05). This increment correlated with the urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin content, the principal biomarker of plasmatic melatonin levels (p {\textless} 0.01). Nevertheless, the phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity levels did not exhibit any significant variation. The comparison of the bioavailability between the melatonin contained in the kidney bean sprouts and in a synthetic solution evidenced slightly higher levels of plasmatic melatonin (17\%) in rats fed with the solution of synthetic melatonin. We conclude that kidney bean sprouts could be a good source of dietary melatonin and other bioactive compounds known to have health benefits.},

	abstract = {Context Oxidative stress is a common mechanism of liver injury. Carnosine is a dipeptide having strong antioxidant effects. Objectives We investigated the effects of carnosine on lead-induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress in rats. Materials and methods Animals received an aqueous solution of lead acetate (500 mg Pb/L in the drinking water) and/or daily oral gavage of carnosine (10 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. Rats were then weighed and used for the biochemical (commercial kits), molecular (standard chemical methods) and histological (microscopic) evaluations. Results Lead-induced oxidative stress in liver tissue was indicated by a significant increase in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) (8.25 ± 0.15 nmol/mg) as well as decrease in the level of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (1.72 ± 0.25 μmol/g) and total thiol (SH) groups) 1.9 ± 0.22 μmol/g). Carnosine treatment decreased MDA (4 ± 0.08 nmol/mg), whereas it increased the contents of total thiol (3.25 ± 0.04 μmol/g) and TAC (3.44 ± 0.32 μmol/g) in the lead group. Carnosine also prevented the decreased body weight (p {\textless} 0.001), albumin (p {\textless} 0.05) and total protein levels (p {\textless} 0.001) and increased liver weight (p {\textless} 0.05) and activates of hepatic enzymes (p's {\textless} 0.001) (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase) in the lead group. Furthermore, histopathological study showed that carnosine attenuates liver damage by decreasing necrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Conclusion Carnosine prevented lead-induced hepatotoxicity, indicated by molecular, biochemical and histopathological analyses through inhibiting lipid peroxidation and enhancing antioxidant defence systems. Therefore, carnosine makes a good candidate to protect against the deleterious effect of chronic lead intoxication.},

MAIN METHODS: Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. Apoptotic cell death was monitored by annexin V-FITC/PI double staining and by TUNEL assay. The formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), expression of antioxidant enzymes and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were determined by 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) assay, RT-PCR, and western blotting, respectively.
KEY FINDINGS: The ethyl acetate fractions from Cirsium setidens (CSEA) and Aster scaber (ASEA) showed neuroprotective effects in SK-N-SH cells. The phytochemicals were isolated from CSEA and ASEA and identified by spectral analyses, as Î²-sitosterol, Dau, Pec, Ast, or isoquercitrin. Pretreatment with Dau, Pec, or Ast showed protective effects against H2O2-induced cell death and inhibited ROS generation by oxidative stress. HO-1 mRNA and protein levels were increased by the presence of H2O2 and were further elevated by pretreatment with Dau and Ast. Dau pretreatment resulted in further increases of H2O2-induced enhancement in levels of CAT and SOD2. Pretreatment with Dau, Pec, and Ast inhibited phosphorylation of MAPK, such as extracellular protein regulated protein kinase, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase by H2O2.
SIGNIFICANCE: Dau exerts its neuroprotective effects by down regulation of MAPK pathways and upregulation of the HO-1, CAT and SOD2 antioxidant genes and is associated with reduced oxidative stress in SK-N-SH cells.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: An open, controlled, randomized, and crossover feeding trial with 40 healthy volunteers was carried out to analyze the metabolites in plasma and urine after the consumption of tomato and tomato sauces, with tomato sauce enriched with refined olive oil (ROOE) and without refined olive oil (oil-free: OF). Ten phenolics in plasma and 93 metabolites in urine were quantified. Processing tomatoes into sauce enhanced the bioavailability of flavanones, flavanols, and some hydroxycinnamic acids, as reflected by the increase in the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve. An increase in their plasma half-life was also observed, particularly after ingestion of ROOE, possibly favored by enterohepatic circulation. A wide variety of gut microbial metabolites was also detected, namely flavanones, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonols, hydroxyphenylpropanoic acids, hydroxyphenylacetic acids, and hydroxybenzoic acids.
CONCLUSIONS: Flavanones and flavonols in ROOE presented higher bioavailability, suggesting that the processing undergone by the raw tomato improved their absorption.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Normal aging results in cognitive decline and nutritional interventions have been suggested as potential approaches for mitigating these deficits. Here, we used rats to investigate the effects of short- and long-term dietary supplementation with the leucine metabolite β-hydroxy-β-methyl butyrate (HMB) on working memory and cognitive flexibility.
METHODS: Beginning ∼12 months of age, male and female Long-Evans rats were given twice daily access to sipper tubes containing calcium HMB (450 mg/kg) or vehicle (285 mg/kg calcium lactate) in a sucrose solution (20\% w/v). Supplementation continued for 1 or 7 months (middle- and old-age (OA) groups, respectively) before testing began. Working memory was assessed by requiring rats to respond on a previously sampled lever following various delays. Cognitive flexibility was assessed by training rats to earn food according to a visual strategy and then, once acquired, shifting to an egocentric response strategy.
RESULTS: Treatment with HMB improved working memory performance in middle-age (MA) males and OA rats of both sexes. In the cognitive flexibility task, there was a significant age-dependent deficit in acquisition of the visual strategy that was not apparent in OA males treated with HMB. Furthermore, HMB ameliorated an apparent deficit in visual strategy acquisition in MA females.
DISCUSSION: Together, these findings suggest that daily nutritional supplementation with HMB facilitates learning and improves working memory performance. As such, HMB supplementation may mitigate age-related cognitive deficits and may therefore be an effective tool to combat this undesirable feature of the aging process.},

Special attention was devoted to the single pass extraction of each compound as well as to the kinetics of uptake. The assay of the amines in the outflowing perfusate was done by means of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The single pass extraction of p-synephrine was higher than 90\% at a portal concentration of 10 μM. It declined with the concentration, but was still around 30\% at the concentration of 500 μM. At low concentrations (10-50 μM) the decreasing sequence of single pass extractions was p-synephrine {\textgreater} p-octopamine ≈ epinephrine {\textgreater} norepinephrine. Rates of uptake versus p-synephrine concentration resulted in a Michaelis-Menten type of relationship, with a KM value of 290.7 ± 32.1 μM and a Vmax of 0.762 ± 0.042 μmol min(-1) g(-1). The rates of uptake of p-octopamine did not present clear saturation and could be approximated by a linear relationship with a first order rate constant of 1.5 min(-1). The rapid hepatic transformation of p-synephrine and p-octopamine means that their concentration in the portal vein exceeds that in the systemic circulation during absorption. Their metabolic effects will, thus, be exerted predominantly in the liver.},

This study was carried out to evaluate the use of hazelnut as a therapy for memory impairment because in Iranian traditional medicine, it is recommended for those suffering from a particular type of dementia, with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: In this study, rats were fed with hazelnut kernel [(without skin) 800 mg/kg/day] during 1 week before stereotaxic surgery to 24 hours before behavioral testing (in general, for 16 consecutive days) and the effect of hazelnut eating on memory, anxiety, neuroinflammation and apoptosis was assessed in the amyloid beta-injected rat.
RESULTS: The results of this study showed that feeding with hazelnut improved memory, (which was examined by using Y-maze test and shuttle box apparatus), and reduced anxiety-related behavior, that was evaluated using elevated plus maze. Also, western blotting analysis of cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein, and caspase-3 showed that hazelnut has an ameliorating effect on the neuroinflammation and apoptosis caused by Aβ.
DISCUSSION: These ﬁndings suggest that hazelnut, as a dietary supplement, improves healthy aging and could be a beneficial diet for the treatment of AD.},

However, information about available food components remains widely unavailable. In the present study, we investigated the effects of dietary β-carotene on the quantity and quality of skeletal muscle under physiological conditions. Male ddY mice (8 wk old) were orally administered β-carotene (0.5 mg once daily) for 14 d. Dietary β-carotene had no influence on body weight, but increased the soleus muscle/body weight ratio. The cross-sectional area (CSA) in muscle fibers of the soleus muscle was increased, indicating that administration of β-carotene induces muscle hypertrophy. In the soleus muscle of the β-carotene-administered mice, twitch force tended to be increased (p=0.06) and tetanic force was significantly increased, whereas specific force (force per CSA) remained unchanged. Dietary β-carotene increased the mRNA level of insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf-1) as its splicing variant Igf-1ea, but had no influence on the liver Igf-1 mRNA level or serum IGF-1 level. β-Carotene promoted protein synthesis in the soleus muscle and reduced levels of ubiquitin conjugates, but had no influence on the mRNA levels of two atrogenes, Atrogin-1 and Murf1. On the other hand, β-carotene had no influence on the processing of the autophagy marker protein light chain 3. These results indicate that in mice, administration of β-carotene increases mass and induces functional hypertrophy in the soleus muscle, perhaps by promoting IGF-1-mediated protein synthesis and by reducing ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.},

Inositol prevented NTD in a genetic mouse model, and was well tolerated by women in a small study of NTD recurrence. In the present study, we report the Prevention of Neural Tube Defects by Inositol (PONTI) pilot study designed to gain further experience of inositol usage in human pregnancy as a preliminary trial to a future large-scale controlled trial to evaluate efficacy of inositol in NTD prevention. Study subjects were UK women with a previous NTD pregnancy who planned to become pregnant again. Of 117 women who made contact, ninety-nine proved eligible and forty-seven agreed to be randomised (double-blind) to peri-conceptional supplementation with inositol plus FA or placebo plus FA. In total, thirty-three randomised pregnancies produced one NTD recurrence in the placebo plus FA group (n 19) and no recurrences in the inositol plus FA group (n 14). Of fifty-two women who declined randomisation, the peri-conceptional supplementation regimen and outcomes of twenty-two further pregnancies were documented. Two NTD recurred, both in women who took only FA in their next pregnancy. No adverse pregnancy events were associated with inositol supplementation. The findings of the PONTI pilot study encourage a large-scale controlled trial of inositol for NTD prevention, but indicate the need for a careful study design in view of the unwillingness of many high-risk women to be randomised.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Release of radionuclides, such as 137Cs and 90Sr, into the atmosphere and the ocean presents an important problem because internal exposure to 137Cs and 90Sr could be very harmful to humans. Chlorella has been reported to be effective in enhancing the excretion of heavy metals; thus, we hypothesized that Chlorella could also enhance the elimination of 137Cs or 90Sr from the body. We evaluated the potential of Chlorella as a decorporation agent in vitro and in vivo, using 85Sr instead of 90Sr.
METHODS: In vitro experiments of adsorption of 137Cs and 85Sr to Chlorella were performed under wide pH conditions. The maximum sorption capacity of Chlorella to strontium was estimated using the Langmuir model. A 85Sr solution was orally administrated to mice pretreated with Chlorella. At 48 h after 85Sr administration, the biodistribution of radioactivity was determined.
RESULTS: In the in vitro experiments, although 85Sr barely adsorbed to Chlorella at low pH, the 85Sr adsorption ratio to Chlorella increased with increasing pH. The maximum sorption capacity of Chlorella to strontium was 9.06 mg / g. 137Cs barely adsorbed to Chlorella under any pH conditions. In the biodistribution experiments, bone accumulation of radioactivity after 85Sr administration was significantly decreased in the Chlorella pretreatment group compared with the non-treatment control group.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, these results indicated that Chlorella could inhibit the absorption of 90Sr into the blood and enhance the elimination of 90Sr from the body through adsorption in intestine. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism and the components of Chlorella needed for adsorption to strontium and could promote the development of more effective decorporation agents.},

This study aims to assess the different effects between oat (whole and bran) and beta-glucan extract intake on glycemic control and insulin sensitivity. PubMed, Embase, Medline, The Cochrane Library, CINAHL and Web of Science were searched up to February 2014. We included randomized controlled trials with interventions that lasted at least four weeks that compared oats and beta-glucan (extracted from oats or other sources) intake with a control. A total of 1351 articles were screened for eligibility, and relevant data were extracted from 18 studies (n = 1024). Oat product dose ranged from 20 g d(-1) to 136 g d(-1), and beta-glucan extract dose ranged from 3 g d(-1) to 10 g d(-1). Compared with the control, oat intake resulted in a greater decrease in fasting glucose and insulin of subjects (P {\textless} 0.05), but beta-glucan extract intake did not. Furthermore, oat intake resulted in a greater decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (P {\textless} 0.001, I(2) = 0\%) and fasting glucose (P {\textless} 0.001, I(2) = 68\%) after removing one study using a concentrate and a different design and fasting insulin of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (P {\textless} 0.001, I(2) = 0\%). The intake of oats and beta-glucan extracted from oats were effective in decreasing fasting glucose (P = 0.007, I(2) = 91\%) and fasting insulin of T2D (P {\textless} 0.001, I(2) = 0\%) and tented to lower HbA1c (P = 0.09, I(2) = 92\%). Higher consumption of whole oats and oat bran, but not oat or barley beta-glucan extracts, are associated with lower HbA1c, fasting glucose and fasting insulin of T2D, hyperlipidaemic and overweight subjects, especially people with T2D, which supports the need for clinical trials to evaluate the potential role of oats in approaching to the management of glycemic control and insulin sensitivity of diabetes or metabolic syndrome subjects.},

We previously demonstrated that Chlorella-derived multicomponent supplementation decreases arterial stiffness in young men. However, mechanisms underlying the reduction in arterial stiffness by Chlorella-derived supplementation and the effect in middle-aged and older individuals have remained unexplored. This study tested our hypothesis that Chlorella-derived supplementation improves arterial stiffness via an increase in nitric oxide (NO, a endothelium-derived relaxing factor) production in middle-aged and older individuals. Thirty-two subjects between 45 and 75 years of age assigned to placebo and Chlorella groups in a double-blinded manner and took respective tablets for 4 weeks. Before and after the supplementations, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV, an index of arterial stiffness) and plasma nitrite/nitrate (NOx, end product of NO) concentration were measured. There was no difference in baPWV between before and after the placebo intake, but baPWV decreased after the Chlorella supplementation. Changes in baPWV with the Chlorella supplementation were correlated with those in plasma NOx concentration. We concluded that Chlorella-derived multicomponent supplementation decreases arterial stiffness in middle-aged and older individuals. It may be associated with increase in NO production by vascular endothelium.},

Dried plum was most effective in reducing the expression of genes related to bone resorption (Nfe2l2, Rankl, Mcp1, Opg, TNF-α) and also preventing later cancellous bone decrements caused by irradiation with either photons or heavy ions.

The objectives of this study were therefore to determine the impact of β-glucan on the composition of gut microbiota in mildly hypercholesterolemic individuals and to identify if the altered microbiota are associated with bioactivity of β-glucan in improving risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Using a randomized, controlled crossover study design, individuals received for 5-week either a treatment breakfast containing 3 g high molecular weight (HMW), 3 g low molecular weight (LMW), 5 g LMW barley β-glucan, or wheat and rice. The American Heart Association (AHA) diet served as the background diet for all treatment groups. Phases were separated by 4-week washout periods. Fecal samples were collected at the end of each intervention phase and subjected to Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Results revealed that at the phylum level, supplementation of 3 g/d HMW β-glucan increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes abundances compared to control (P {\textless} 0.001). At the genus level, consumption of 3 g/d HMW β-glucan increased Bacteroides (P {\textless} 0.003), tended to increase Prevotella (P {\textless} 0.1) but decreased Dorea (P {\textless} 0.1), whereas diets containing 5 g LMW β-glucan and 3 g LMW β-glucan failed to alter the gut microbiota composition. Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Dorea composition correlated (P {\textless} 0.05) with shifts of CVD risk factors, including body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, as well as triglyceride levels. Our data suggest that consumption of HMW β-glucan favorably alters the composition of gut microbiota and this altered microbiota profile associates with a reduction of CVD risk markers. Together, our study suggests that β-glucan induced shifts in gut microbiota in a MW-dependent manner and that might be one of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the physiological benefits of β-glucan.},

Postmeal insulin concentrations (6 h) were significantly reduced after the 40-g FDS beverage compared to other beverages (p {\textless} 0.05). Postmeal 6 h glucose concentrations were not different, although mean insulin:glucose ratio was significantly different among beverages (p {\textless} 0.05). Pelargonidin-glucuronide was inversely associated with mean insulin concentrations after the 20 and 40 g FDS (p {\textless} 0.05). Oxidized low-density lipoprotein was reduced after 20 g FDS (p {\textless} 0.05) and IL-6 was not different among treatments. Strawberry intake reduced the insulin demand to manage postmeal glucose in obese individuals with IR, which was related to plasma anthocyanin/pelargonidin concentrations.
CONCLUSION: The data support a role of strawberries in improving insulin sensitivity in people with IR.},

	abstract = {SCOPE: Xanthohumol (XN) is a hop flavonoid found in beers and refreshment drinks. Results of in vitro and animal studies indicate that it causes beneficial health effects due to DNA protective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and phytoestrogenic properties. Aim of the present study was to find out if XN causes alterations of health-related parameters in humans.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of the flavonoid were investigated in a randomized crossover intervention trial (n = 22) in which the participants consumed a XN drink (12 mg XN/P/day). We monitored alterations of the DNA stability in single cell gel electrophoresis assays in lymphocytes and of several health-related biomarkers. A decrease of oxidatively damaged purines and protection toward reactive oxygen species induced DNA damage was found after the consumption of the beverage; also the excretion of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine and 8-oxo-guanosine in urine was reduced. The assumption that the flavonoid causes DNA protection was confirmed in a randomized follow-up study with pure XN (n = 10) with a parallel design. Other biochemical parameters reflecting the redox- and hormonal status and lipid- and glucose metabolism were not altered after the intervention.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data indicate that low doses of XN protect humans against oxidative DNA damage.},

For chronic restraint stress, rats were kept in the restrainers for 6â€‰h every day, for 21 consecutive days. The animals received systemic administrations of CAR daily for 21 days. To evaluate the changes of the oxidative stress parameters following restraint stress, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and catalase (CAT) activities were measured in the brain, liver, and kidney. In the stressed animals that received vehicle, the MDA level was significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.001) and the levels of GSH and antioxidant enzymes were significantly lower than the nonstressed animals (P {\textless} 0.001). CAR ameliorated the changes in the stressed animals as compared with the control group (P {\textless} 0.001). This study indicates that CAR can prevent restraint stress induced oxidative damage.},

	doi = {10.1038/bjc.2014.391},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Haploinsufficiency may contribute to the development of breast cancer among women with a BRCA1 mutation. Thus, interventions that enhance BRCA1 expression may represent avenues for prevention. Studies have shown that 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) can upregulate BRCA1 expression in breast cancer cells. This has yet to be demonstrated in vivo.
METHODS: We conducted a study to evaluate the ability of oral DIM to upregulate BRCA1 mRNA expression in white blood cells. A total of 18 women were enroled in the study, including 13 BRCA1 mutation carriers who received 300 mg per day of Rx Balance BioResponse DIM for 4-6 weeks (intervention group) and 5 BRCA1 mutation carriers who did not take DIM (control group). BRCA1 mRNA expression was assessed at baseline and at 4-6 weeks by real-time, quantitative PCR and the relative change in BRCA1 mRNA expression (that is, 2(-ΔΔCT)) was calculated.
RESULTS: The relative change in BRCA1 mRNA expression among women in the intervention group achieved borderline significance (P paired t-test=0.05). In the intervention group, BRCA1 mRNA expression increased in 10 of the participants, decreased in 2 and remained unchanged in 1 of the participants following DIM intervention (P sign test=0.02). On average, women in the intervention group experienced a 34\% increase in BRCA1 mRNA expression (range -24 to 194\%). There was no significant difference in the relative change in BRCA1 mRNA expression among women in the control group (P paired t-test=0.45).
CONCLUSIONS: Under the tested conditions, oral DIM was associated with an increase in BRCA1 mRNA expression in women with a BRCA1 mutation. The possibility of mitigating the effect of an inherited deleterious BRCA1 mutation by increasing the physiologic expression of the gene and normalising protein levels represents a clinically important paradigm shift in the prevention strategies available to these high-risk women. Future studies with a larger sample size and higher doses of DIM are warranted.},

	abstract = {Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS, OMIM 176670) is a rare multisystem childhood premature aging disorder linked to mutations in the LMNA gene. The most common HGPS mutation is found at position G608G within exon 11 of the LMNA gene. This mutation results in the deletion of 50 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal tail of prelamin A, and the truncated protein is called progerin. Progerin only undergoes a subset of the normal post-translational modifications and remains permanently farnesylated. Several attempts to rescue the normal cellular phenotype with farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) and other compounds have resulted in partial cellular recovery. Using proteomics, we report here that progerin induces changes in the composition of the HGPS nuclear proteome, including alterations to several components of the protein degradation pathways. Consequently, proteasome activity and autophagy are impaired in HGPS cells. To restore protein clearance in HGPS cells, we treated HGPS cultures with sulforaphane (SFN), an antioxidant derived from cruciferous vegetables. We determined that SFN stimulates proteasome activity and autophagy in normal and HGPS fibroblast cultures. Specifically, SFN enhances progerin clearance by autophagy and reverses the phenotypic changes that are the hallmarks of HGPS. Therefore, SFN is a promising therapeutic avenue for children with HGPS.},

However, during storage indole-3-carbinol slowly degraded to 0.68 μmol/100 g FW, while ascorbigen was relatively stable from Week 4 until Week 8 at 6.78 μmol/100 g FW. In contrast, the content of indole-3-acetonitrile decreased rapidly during fermentation from 3.6 to 0.14 μmol/100 g FW.

Recent studies suggest the flavonoid luteolin reduces neuroinflammation and improves learning and memory in aged mice. However, if dietary luteolin reduces microglia activity in the brain of senescent mice is not known. We hypothesized that feeding aged mice a diet with luteolin would reduce microglia activity. Adult (3-6 months) and aged (22-24 months) mice were fed American Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-93M or AIN-93M with luteolin (6 g/kg) for 4 weeks and injected intraperitoneally with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) before microglia were isolated and stained for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 for flow cytometry. In saline-treated mice fed control diet, aging increased the proportion of microglia that stained for MHC class II ({\textless}3\% for adults vs. 23\% for aged), IL-1β ({\textless}2\% for adults vs. 25\% for aged), and IL-6 ({\textless}2\% for adults vs. 25\% for aged), indicating an age-related increase in proinflammatory microglia. In saline-treated aged mice fed luteolin, the proportion of microglia that stained for MHC class II, IL-1β, and IL-6 was reduced by nearly half (to 12\%, 13\%, and 12\%, respectively). Interestingly, luteolin significantly reduced the proportion of microglia that stained for IL-1β and IL-6 in LPS-treated adult mice but not aged. Collectively, the results show that a diet supplemented with luteolin inhibited brain microglia activity during aging and activation by LPS in adults. Therefore, luteolin may inhibit neuroinflammation and improve cognition in the otherwise healthy aged by constraining brain microglia.},

	abstract = {Epigallo-catechin-3-gallate (EGCG), found in the leaves of Camellia sinensis (green tea), has antioxidant- and scavenger-functions and acts neuroprotectively. It has been publicized as anti-aging remedy but data on potential cellular mechanisms are scarce. Recent studies claimed that EGCG specifically promotes neural precursor cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of C57Bl/6 mice, without changes at the level of immature and mature new neurons. We here analyzed the effects of EGCG on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in male Balb/C mice and saw a different pattern. Two weeks of treatment with EGCG (0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10mg/kg) showed a dose-response curve that peaked at 2.5mg/kg of EGCG with significantly increased cell survival without affecting cell proliferation but decreasing apoptotic cells. Also, EGCG increased the population of doublecortin-(DCX)-expressing cells that comprises the late intermediate progenitor cells (type-2b and -3) as well as immature neurons. After EGCG treatment, the young DCX-positive neurons showed more elaborated dendritic trees. EGCG also significantly increased net neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus and increased the hippocampal levels of phospho-Akt. Ex vivo, EGCG exerted a direct effect on survival and neuronal differentiation of adult hippocampal precursor cells, which was absent, when PI3K, a protein upstream of Akt, was blocked. Our results thus support a pro-survival and a pro-neurogenic role of EGCG. In the context of the conflicting published results, however, potential genetic modifiers must be assumed. These might help to explain the overall variability of study results with EGCG. Our data do indicate, however, that natural compounds such as EGCG can in principle modulate brain plasticity.},

This study examined the effect of resveratrol (RSV) on endothelium-dependent contraction and cell signaling in the common carotid artery (CCA) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). Acetylcholine (Ach)-stimulated endothelium-dependent nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-mediated relaxation in precontracted SHR CCA was impaired (maximum 73 ± 6\% vs. 87 ± 5\% in WKY) (P {\textless} 0.05) by competitive COX-mediated contraction. Chronic (28-day) treatment in vivo (drinking water) with a ∼0.075 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1) RSV dose affected neither endothelium-dependent relaxation nor endothelium-dependent contraction and associated prostaglandin (PG) production evaluated in non-precontracted NOS-blocked CCA. In contrast, a chronic ∼7.5 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1) RSV dose improved endothelium-dependent relaxation (94 ± 6\%) and attenuated endothelium-dependent contraction (58 ± 4\% vs. 73 ± 5\% in No-RSV) and PG production (183 ± 43 vs. 519 ± 93 pg/ml) in SHR CCA, while U46619-stimulated TP receptor-mediated contraction was unaffected. In separate acute in vitro experiments, 20-μM RSV preincubation attenuated endothelium-dependent contraction (6 ± 4\% vs. 62 ± 2\% in No Drug) and PG production (121 ± 15 vs. 491 ± 93 pg/ml) and attenuated U46619-stimulated contraction (134 ± 5\% vs. 171 ± 4\%) in non-precontracted NOS-blocked SHR CCA. Compound C, a known AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, did not prevent the RSV attenuating effect on Ach- and U46619-stimulated contraction but did prevent the RSV attenuating effect on PG production (414 ± 58 pg/ml). These data demonstrate that RSV can attenuate endothelium-dependent contraction both by suppressing arterial wall PG production, which may be partially mediated by AMPK, and by TP receptor hyporesponsiveness, which does not appear to be mediated by AMPK.},

In this work we systematically evaluated the influence of treatment with different elicitors (sucrose, mannitol, NaCl, 1-aminocyclopropane-L-carboxylic acid, salicylic acid and methyl jasmonate) on the phytochemical composition of broccoli sprouts. The content of total and single glucosinolates, total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids, total anthocyanins, vitamin C and E and Î²-carotene was assessed. The exposure to different elicitors produced concentration- and elicitor-dependent specific changes in the content of all the phytochemicals considered. Sucrose, identified as the most effective elicitor by principal component analysis, induced a significant increase of total and specific glucosinolates, vitamin C, total anthocyanins and polyphenols.

In addition, we found that low level of DIM increased the expression of stemness factors and enhanced the pluripotency of gastric cancer cells. Low level of DIM promoted gastric cancer progression by inducing the PORCN-dependent secretion of Wnt4 and the activation of β-catenin signaling. Wnt4 knockdown reversed the effects of low level of DIM on gastric cancer cells. The results of in vivo studies showed that gastric cancer cells treated with low level of DIM (1 μM) grew faster and expressed higher level of Wnt4 than control cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that low level of DIM activates autocrine Wnt4 signaling to enhance the progression of gastric cancer, which may suggest an adverse aspect of DIM in cancer therapy.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that acute and chronic treatment with ethanol (EtOH), respectively, decelerated and accelerated the propagation of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in rats and that the antioxidant carotenoid astaxanthin counteracted these effects. Here, we investigated whether noncarotenoid antioxidants exert the same action by testing α-tocopherol in rats of various ages, with and without 5 to 10 days of EtOH abstinence.
METHODS: Male Wistar young adult (60 to 80 days old) and mature adult (150 to 180 days old) rats received per gavage acute (1 day) or chronic (21 days) treatment with 3 g/kg/d EtOH combined with acute (300 mg/kg) or chronic (85 mg/kg/d) treatment with α-tocopherol or vehicle-only treatment (olive oil and water for α-tocopherol and EtOH, respectively). CSD was recorded over 4 hours and the velocity of CSD propagation was calculated. On both ages, animals under chronic EtOH treatment were subjected to CSD recording immediately after EtOH treatment or after a 5- to 10-day period of EtOH abstinence.
RESULTS: In both age groups, acute and chronic EtOH exposure decelerated and accelerated CSD, respectively, versus the corresponding control groups. Addition of α-tocopherol counteracted the effects of EtOH on CSD, returning CSD velocities to levels in control groups (p {\textless} 0.05). Chronic α-tocopherol (85 mg/kg/d) did not alter CSD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data reinforce the counteracting role of antioxidants on brain processes involved in the action of EtOH on CSD and suggest that this role is not a particular property of carotenoids; furthermore, this general feature of antioxidants is not substantially influenced by age or by 5 to 10 days of EtOH abstinence.},

Although these nations have limited access to novel therapeutics, they do have access to foods that contain chemopreventive bioactive compounds such as anthocyanins, and as such, consumption of these foods can be encouraged to combat cancer. We and others have previously characterized the anti-colon cancer properties of dietary anthocyanins from different sources. Eugenia jambolana (Java plum) is a tropical medicinal fruit rich in anthocyanins, however, its anti-colon cancer properties are not well characterized. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that colon cancer stem cells (colon CSCs) promote resistance to chemotherapy, relapse of tumors and contribute to poor prognosis. The objectives of this study were to 1) characterize the anthocyanin profile of Java plum using HPLC-MS; and 2) determine the anti-proliferative (cell counting and MTT) and pro-apoptotic (TUNEL and caspase 3/7 glo assay) properties of Java plum fruit extract (JPE) using HCT-116 colon cancer cell line and colon CSCs (positive for CD 44, CD 133 and ALDH1b1 markers). HPLC-MS analysis showed that JPE contains a variety of anthocyanins including glucosides of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin and malvidin. JPE anthocyanins suppressed (p {\textless} 0.05) proliferation in HCT-116 cells and elevated (p {\textless} 0.05) apoptosis in both HCT-116 cells and colon CSCs. JPE also suppressed the stemness in colon CSCs as evaluated using colony formation assay. These results warrant further assessment of the anti-cancer activity of JPE, and its molecular mechanisms using pre-clinical models of colon cancer.},

Sulforaphane (SFN) increases the expression of DHT degrading enzymes, such as 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3α-HSDs), and, therefore, SFN treatment may improve AGA. To determine the effects of SFN on hair growth, we administered SFN (10 mg/kg BW, IP) or vehicle (DMSO) to ob/ob mice for six weeks and examined hair regeneration and the plasma levels of testosterone and DHT. We also tested the effects of SFN on the expression of two forms of 3α-HSD, aldo-keto reductase 1c21 and dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR family) member 9, both in vitro and in vivo. SNF significantly enhanced hair regeneration in ob/ob mice. The mice treated with SFN showed lower plasma levels of testosterone and DHT than those treated with vehicle. SFN increased the mRNA and protein levels of the two forms of 3α-HSD in the liver of the mice and in cultured murine hepatocyte Hepa1c1c7 cells. These results suggest that SFN treatment increases the amount of 3α-HSDs in the liver, accelerates the degradation of blood DHT, and subsequently blocks the suppression of hair growth by DHT.},

In this study, muscle satellite cells were isolated and purified by high-throughput pre-plating method (∼{\textgreater}60\%) from 10 days old mice skeletal muscles. Evaluation of paired-box 7 (Pax7) expressions then confirmed the purification. Treatment of the cells with UA showed that UA up-regulated SIRT1 (∼35 folds) and overexpressed PGC-1α (∼175 folds) gene significantly. Moreover, the number of muscle satellite cells, which accompanied by initiation of neomyogenesis in the animal skeletal muscles, was increased (∼3.4 times). We also evaluated UA-mediated changes in the cellular energy status in the skeletal muscles. The results revealed that in the UA-treated mice, ATP and ADP contents in the various skeletal muscle tissue types, including: Gastrocnemius (Gas), Tibialis Anterior (Tib) and Gluteus Maximus (Glu) have been significantly decreased (P≤0.001); 2.2, 3.2, 2 times for ATP, and 9.6, 35.7, 11.6 times for ADP, respectively; however to compensate this process mitochondrial biogenesis occurred (12.33\%±1.5 times). Furthermore, a rise in ATP/ADP ratio was observed 2.5, 4.5, 2.05 times for Gas, Tib and Glu muscles, respectively (P≤0.001). Alternatively, UA enhanced the expression of myoglobin (∼2 folds) in concert with remodeling of glycolytic muscle fibers to mainly fast IIA (∼30\%) and slow-twitch (∼4\%) types as well. Finally, our study indicated that UA indirectly mimicked beneficial effects of short-term calorie restriction and exercise (fast-oxidative) by directing the skeletal muscle composition toward oxidative metabolism.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of antinociceptive tolerance following repetitive administration of opioid analgesics significantly hinders their clinical use. Evidence has accumulated indicating that microglia within the spinal cord plays a critical role in morphine tolerance. The inhibitor of microglia is effective to attenuate the tolerance; however, the mechanism is not fully understood. Our present study investigated the effects and possible mechanism of a natural product procyanidins in improving morphine tolerance via its specific inhibition on NOD-like receptor protein3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in microglia.
METHODS: CD-1 mice were used for tail-flick test to evaluate the degree of pain. The microglial cell line BV-2 was used to investigate the effects and the mechanism of procyanidins. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced from BV-2 cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. Cell signaling was measured by western blot assay and immunofluorescence assay.
RESULTS: Co-administration of procyanidins with morphine potentiated its antinociception effect and attenuated the development of acute and chronic morphine tolerance. Procyanidins also inhibited morphine-induced increase of interleukin-1β and activation of NOD-like receptor protein3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Furthermore, procyanidins decreased the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, inhibited the translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and suppressed the level of reactive oxygen species in microglia.
CONCLUSIONS: Procyanidins suppresses morphine-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and inflammatory responses in microglia, and thus resulting in significant attenuation of morphine antinociceptive tolerance.},

We carried out a clinical trial to determine whether PEITC also inhibits the metabolic activation of NNK in smokers. Cigarette smokers were recruited and asked to smoke cigarettes containing deuterium labelled [pyridine-D4]NNK for an acclimation period of at least one week. Then subjects were randomly assigned to one of two arms: PEITC followed by placebo, or placebo followed by PEITC. During the one-week treatment period, each subject took PEITC (10 mg in 1 ml of olive oil, 4 times per day). There was a one week washout period between the PEITC and placebo periods. The NNK metabolic activation ratio: [pyridine-D4]hydroxy acid/total [pyridine-D4]NNAL was measured in urine samples to test the hypothesis that PEITC treatment modified NNK metabolism. Eighty-two smokers completed the study and were included in the analysis. Overall, the NNK metabolic activation ratio was reduced by 7.7\% with PEITC treatment (P = 0.023). The results of this trial, while modest in effect size, provide a basis for further investigation of PEITC as an inhibitor of lung carcinogenesis by NNK in smokers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The association between gluten and body weight is inconsistent. Previously, we showed that a gluten-free diet reduces weight gain without changing food intake in mice fed high-fat diets. In the present study, we investigated the effects of gluten intake on fat metabolism, thermogenesis and energy expenditure in mice fed a standard or high-fat diet.
METHODS: Mice were fed four different experimental diets during 8 weeks: a control-standard diet (CD), a CD added with 4.5\% of wheat gluten (CD-G), a high-fat diet (HFD) and a HFD added with 4.5\% of wheat gluten (HFD-G). After 8 weeks, the mice received (99m)Tc-radiolabeled gluten orally to study gluten absorption and biodistribution or they underwent indirect calorimetry. After killing, subcutaneous and brown adipose tissues (SAT and BAT) were collected to assess thermogenesis-related protein expression. Lipid metabolism was studied in adipocyte cultures from the four groups.
RESULTS: Despite having had the same energy intake, CD-G and HFD-G mice exhibited increased body weight and fat deposits compared with their respective controls. (99m)Tc-GLU or its peptides were detected in the blood, liver and visceral adipose tissue, suggesting that gluten can even reach extraintestinal organs. Uncoupling protein-1 expression was reduced in the BAT of HFD-G and in the SAT of CD-G and HFD-G mice. Indirect calorimetry showed lower oxygen volume consumption in CD-G and HFD-G groups compared with their controls. In HFD mice, daily energy expenditure was reduced with gluten intake. Gluten also reduced adiponectin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α and PPARγ and hormone-sensitive lipase in cultures of isolated adipocytes from HFD mice, whereas in the CD-G group, gluten intake increased interleukin-6 expression and tended to increase that of tumor necrosis factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Wheat gluten promotes weight gain in animals on both HFD and CD, partly by reducing the thermogenic capacity of adipose tissues.},

We conducted a randomised, double-blind, controlled, crossover trial to investigate the effects of a phenolic-rich olive leaf extract (OLE) on BP and a number of associated vascular and metabolic measures.
METHODS: A total of 60 pre-hypertensive [systolic blood pressure (SBP): 121-140 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure (DBP): 81-90 mmHg] males [mean age 45 (±SD 12.7 years, BMI 26.7 (±3.21) kg/m2] consumed either OLE (136 mg oleuropein; 6 mg hydroxytyrosol) or a polyphenol-free control daily for 6 weeks before switching to the alternate arm after a 4-week washout.
RESULTS: Daytime [-3.95 (±SD 11.48) mmHg, p = 0.027] and 24-h SBP [-3.33 (±SD 10.81) mmHg, p = 0.045] and daytime and 24-h DBP [-3.00 (±SD 8.54) mmHg, p = 0.025; -2.42 (±SD 7.61) mmHg, p = 0.039] were all significantly lower following OLE intake, relative to the control. Reductions in plasma total cholesterol [-0.32 (±SD 0.70) mmol/L, p = 0.002], LDL cholesterol [-0.19 (±SD 0.56) mmol/L, p = 0.017] and triglycerides [-0.18 (±SD 0.48), p = 0.008] were also induced by OLE compared to control, whilst a reduction in interleukin-8 [-0.63 (±SD 1.13) pg/ml; p = 0.026] was also detected. Other markers of inflammation, vascular function and glucose metabolism were not affected.
CONCLUSION: Our data support previous research, suggesting that OLE intake engenders hypotensive and lipid-lowering effects in vivo.},

	abstract = {Brassica vegetables are common components of the diet and have beneficial as well as potentially adverse health effects. Following enzymatic breakdown, some glucosinolates in brassica vegetables produce sulforaphane, phenethyl, and indolylic isothiocyanates that possess anticarcinogenic activity. In contrast, progoitrin and indolylic glucosinolates degrade to goitrin and thiocyanate, respectively, and may decrease thyroid hormone production. Radioiodine uptake to the thyroid is inhibited by 194 μmol of goitrin, but not by 77 μmol of goitrin. Collards, Brussels sprouts, and some Russian kale (Brassica napus) contain sufficient goitrin to potentially decrease iodine uptake by the thyroid. However, turnip tops, commercial broccoli, broccoli rabe, and kale belonging to Brassica oleracae contain less than 10 μmol of goitrin per 100-g serving and can be considered of minimal risk. Using sulforaphane plasma levels following glucoraphanin ingestion as a surrogate for thiocyanate plasma concentrations after indole glucosinolate ingestion, the maximum thiocyanate contribution from indole glucosinolate degradation is estimated to be 10 μM, which is significantly lower than background plasma thiocyanate concentrations (40-69 μM). Thiocyanate generated from consumption of indole glucosinolate can be assumed to have minimal adverse risks for thyroid health.},

Activation of CB2 receptors notably appeared devoid of psychotropic adverse effect of cannabinoids contrary to the CB1 receptors. In addition, it activates peroxisome proliferated activator receptors (PPARs) isoforms; PPAR-α \&-γ and inhibits pathways triggered by the activation of toll like receptor complex; CD14/TLR4/MD2, reduce immuneinflammatory processes and exhibit synergy with µ-opioid receptor dependent pathways. Additionally, it found as potent antagonist of homomeric nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7-nAChRs) and devoid of effects mediated by serotonergic and GABAergic receptors. It also modulates numerous molecular targets by altering their gene expression, signaling pathways or through direct interaction. Various pharmacological activities such as cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, gastroprotective, neuroprotective, nephroprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and immune-modulator have been reported in experimental studies. It has shown potent therapeutic promise in neuropathic pain, neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases.
CONCLUSION: The present review provides a comprehensive insight of pharmacological and therapeutic potential of BCP, its molecular mechanism and signaling pathways in different pathological conditions. The review also examines the possibility of its further development as a novel candidate for various pathologies considering the polypharmacological and multifaceted therapeutic properties potential along with favorable oral bioavailability, lipophilicity and physicochemical properties.},

	abstract = {Neuropathic pain can be considered as a form of chronic stress that may share common neuropathological mechanism between pain and stress-related depression and respond to similar treatment. Ferulic acid (FA) is a major active component of angelica sinensis and has been reported to exert antidepressant-like effects; however, it remains unknown whether FA ameliorate chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain and the involvement of descending monoaminergic system and opioid receptors. Chronic treatment with FA (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg) ameliorated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in von Frey hair and hot plate tasks, accompanied by increasing spinal noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) levels. Subsequent study suggested that treatment of CCI animals with 40 and 80 mg/kg FA also inhibited spinal MAO-A levels. FA's effects on mechanical allodynia or thermal hyperalgesiawas blocked by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) via pharmacological depletion of spinal noradrenaline or serotonin. Moreover, the anti-allodynic action of FA on mechanical stimuli was prevented by pre-treatment with beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551, or by the delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole. While the anti-hyperalgesia on thermal stimuli induced by FA was blocked by pre-treatment with 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635, or with the irreversible mu-opioid receptor antagonist beta-funaltrexamine. These results suggest that the effect of FA on neuropathic pain is potentially mediated via amelioration of the descending monoaminergic system that coupled with spinal beta2- and 5-HT1A receptors and the downstream delta- and mu-opioid receptors differentially.},

Evidence suggests that curcumin can ameliorate the learning and memory deficits of AD. To investigate the effects of curcumin on synapses, APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice (an AD model) were used, and the ultra-structures of synapses and synapse-associated proteins were observed. Six months after administration, few abnormal synapses were observed upon electron microscopy in the hippocampal CA1 areas of the APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice. The treatment of the mice with curcumin resulted in improvements in the quantity and structure of the synapses. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses revealed that the expressions of PSD95 and Shank1 were reduced in the hippocampal CA1 areas of the APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice, but curcumin treatment increased the expressions of these proteins. Our findings suggest that curcumin improved the structure and function of the synapses by regulating the synapse-related proteins PSD95 and Shank1.},

	volume = {20},
	issn = {2284-0729},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Curcumin is known to interrupt pro-inflammatory signalling and increases anti-oxidant protection, thus inhibiting the expression of inflammatory cytokines and the expression and function of inducible inflammatory enzymes. Together, these effects contribute to limit the onset and the progression of sarcopenia, due to the major role played by inflammation in the pathophysiology of this disease. This registry study evaluates the effects of Meriva® supplementation in otherwise healthy elderly subjects.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a registry, supplement study, conducted in healthy subjects {\textgreater} 65 years with apparent loss of strength and tiredness who freely decided to start one of the following interventions: (1) standard management (exercise, balanced diet including proteins) (n = 33); (2) standard management + Meriva® one tablet/day (n = 31); (3) standard management + Meriva® one tablet/day + other supplementation (n = 22). A number of functional and biochemical parameters were evaluated at baseline and after three months (hand grip, weight lifting, time/distance before feeling tired after cycling, walking and climbing stairs; general fitness, proteinuria, oxidative stress, Karnofsky scale; left ventricular ejection fraction).
RESULTS: Significant improvements in all parameters, with respect to baseline values, were observed in the two supplementation groups (p {\textless} 0.05 for all comparisons). On the other hand, no improvement was observed in the standard management-only group. At three months, inter-group comparison revealed a statistical advantage in all parameters for both supplementation groups compared with the standard management-only group (p {\textless} 0.05 for all comparisons).
CONCLUSIONS: Our registry study shows that the addition of Meriva® - either or not combined with other nutritional supplements - to standardized diet and exercise plan contributes to improve strength and physical performance in elderly subjects, potentially preventing the onset of sarcopenia.},

The present study explores the effects of relatively short- and long-term (7 and 31 weeks) oral HMB supplementation starting at 12 months of age in male and female rats on the dendritic tree of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. Since female rats continue to secrete ovarian hormones after reaching reproductive senescence, middle-aged female rats were ovariectomized to model humans. As expected, there were fewer spines and a retraction of dendritic material in the apical and basilar trees in old age controls of both sexes compared with their middle-aged counterparts. However, these losses did not occur in the HMB-treated rats in either dendrites or the total number of dendritic spines. Thus, HMB forestalled the effects of aging on the dendritic tree of this population of neurons.},

As the nutritional compounds may promote the reduction of inflammation by activation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), the aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effects of Brazil nut supplementation on Nrf2 activation in HD patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirteen HD patients received one Brazil nut supplementation per day for 3 months and were compared to 12 HD patients without supplementation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and processed for expression of nuclear factor kappa B, Nrf2, and
NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) by quantitative real-time PCR. Plasma malondialdehyde, C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels were measured before and after supplementation. The Nrf2 expression increased and nuclear factor kappa B expression reducedpost supplementation. In addition, the cytokines and malondialdehyde levels decreased significantly. No significant alterations were found in the control group.
CONCLUSION: This preliminary result indicates the effectiveness of Brazil nut supplementation on human Nrf2 activation in HD patients and could be a possible explanation for the beneficial effects of this nut as a bioactive compound.},

As tomato sauces are usually cooked with the addition of oil, some studies have pointed out that both processes may increase the bioavailability of the bioactive compounds. However, the effect of consumption of raw tomatoes and tomato sauces on inflammation biomarkers and adhesion molecules related to atherosclerosis remains unknown. The aim of this study was to test the postprandial effects of a single dose of raw tomatoes (RT), tomato sauce (TS) and tomato sauce with refined olive oil (TSOO) on cardiovascular disease risk factors. We performed an open, prospective, randomized, cross-over, controlled feeding trial in 40 healthy subjects who randomly received: 7.0 g of RT/kg of body weight (BW), 3.5 g of TS/kg BW, 3.5 g of TSOO/Kg BW and 0.25 g of sugar solved in water/kg BW on a single occasion on four different days. Biochemical parameters and cellular and circulating inflammatory biomarkers were assessed at baseline and 6 h after each intervention. The results indicate that, compared to control intervention, a single tomato intake in any form decreased plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides and several cellular and plasma inflammatory biomarkers, and increased plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol and interleukine (IL) 10 concentrations. However, the changes of plasma IL-6 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) from T-lymphocytes and CD36 from monocytes were significantly greater after TSOO than after RT and TS interventions.

Interleukin (IL)-17A are tightly related with autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. Thus, we explored the effects and underlying molecular mechanism of high salt and potassium supplementation on IL-17A production in T lymphocytes. Forty-nine healthy participants received a low-salt, high-salt, followed by a high-salt diet plus potassium supplement for 7 days, respectively. Human T lymphocyte Jurkat cells were treated with different concentrations of NaCl and KCl. In the participants, IL-17A levels in plasma and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were significantly increased after a high-salt diet, which was dramatically reversed when potassium was supplemented. In Jurkat cells, the addition of 40 mM NaCl markedly enhanced IL-17A production and the expression of phosphorylated p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and its downstream target, serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK)1, whereas combined treatment with additional 2 mM KCl significantly decreased them. Respective inhibition of p38/MAPK and SGK1 suppressed IL-17A expression induced by NaCl, and KCl inhibited IL-17A production induced by specific activator of p38/MAPK. We conclude potassium supplementation has a blocking effect on IL-17A production in T lymphocytes induced by salt loading. This protective effect is mediated through the direct suppression of p38/MAPK-SGK1 pathway.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Carnosine is a naturally present dipeptide in humans and an over-the counter food additive. Evidence from animal studies supports the role for carnosine in the prevention and treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, yet there is limited human data. This study investigated whether carnosine supplementation in individuals with overweight or obesity improves diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors.
METHODS: In a double-blind randomized pilot trial in nondiabetic individuals with overweight and obesity (age 43 ± 8 years; body mass index 31 ± 4 kg/m(2) ), 15 individuals were randomly assigned to 2 g carnosine daily and 15 individuals to placebo for 12 weeks. Insulin sensitivity and secretion, glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test), blood pressure, plasma lipid profile, skeletal muscle ((1) H-MRS), and urinary carnosine levels were measured.
RESULTS: Carnosine concentrations increased in urine after supplementation (P {\textless} 0.05). An increase in fasting insulin and insulin resistance was hampered in individuals receiving carnosine compared to placebo, and this remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and change in body weight (P = 0.02, P = 0.04, respectively). Two-hour glucose and insulin were both lower after carnosine supplementation compared to placebo in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (P {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These pilot intervention data suggest that carnosine supplementation may be an effective strategy for prevention of type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Green tea catechins may play a role in body weight regulation through interactions with the gut microbiota.
AIM: We examined whether green tea supplementation for 12 weeks induces changes in composition of the human gut microbiota.
METHODS: 58 Caucasian men and women were included in a randomized, placebo-controlled design. For 12 weeks, subjects consumed either green tea ({\textgreater}0.56 g/d epigallocatechin-gallate + 0.28 âˆ¼ 0.45 g/d caffeine) or placebo capsules. Fecal samples were collected twice (baseline, vs. week 12) for analyses of total bacterial profiles by means of IS-profiling, a 16S-23S interspacer region-based profiling method.
RESULTS: No significant changes between baseline and week 12 in subjects receiving green tea or placebo capsules, and no significant interactions between treatment (green tea or placebo) and time (baseline and week 12) were observed for body composition. Analysis of the fecal samples in subjects receiving green tea and placebo showed similar bacterial diversity and community structures, indicating there were no significant changes in bacterial diversity between baseline and week 12 in subjects receiving green tea capsules or in subjects receiving placebo capsules. No significant interactions were observed between treatment (green tea or placebo) and time (baseline and week 12) for the gut microbial diversity. Although, there were no significant differences between normal weight and overweight subjects in response to green tea, we did observe a reduced bacterial alpha diversity in overweight as compared to normal weight subjects (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: Green tea supplementation for 12 weeks did not have a significant effect on composition of the gut microbiota.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have suggested a protective effect of magnesium intake on cardiovascular disease risk. However, intervention trials of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure and conventional cardiometabolic risk markers are inconsistent. Effects on vascular function markers related to cardiovascular disease risk have rarely been studied.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the effects of long-term magnesium supplementation on arterial stiffness.
DESIGN: We performed a 24-wk, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study. Fifty-two overweight and slightly obese individuals (30 men and 22 postmenopausal women, mean ± SD age: 62 ± 6 y) were randomly allocated to receive either 3 times daily magnesium (3 × 117 mg or 350 mg/d) or placebo capsules. Twenty-four-hour urine collections and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure assessments were performed at the start and end of the study. Carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWVc-f) was assessed at baseline, after 12 wk, and at week 24.
RESULTS: Serum magnesium concentrations did not differ after 12 wk but tended to increase after 24-wk magnesium supplementation compared with placebo by 0.02 mmol/L (95\% CI: 0.00, 0.04 mmol/L; P = 0.09). Twenty-four-hour urinary magnesium excretion increased by 2.01 mmol (95\% CI: 1.22, 2.93 mmol; P {\textless} 0.001) at week 24. PWVc-f was not changed after 12 wk (0.0 m/s; 95\% CI: -0.6, 0.5 m/s; P = 0.90) but was improved in the magnesium compared with the placebo group by 1.0 m/s (95\% CI: 0.4, 1.6 m/s; P = 0.001) after 24 wk. Office and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure levels were not changed. No adverse events were observed.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that a daily magnesium supplement of 350 mg for 24 wk in overweight and obese adults reduces arterial stiffness, as estimated by a decrease in PWVc-f, suggesting a potential mechanism by which an increased dietary magnesium intake beneficially affects cardiovascular health.

	abstract = {The cell membrane Na,K-ATPase is a member of the P-type family of active cation transport proteins. Recently the molecular structure of the related sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase in an E1 conformation has been determined at 2.6 A resolution. Furthermore, theoretical models of the Ca-ATPase in E2 conformations are available. As a result of these developments, these structural data have allowed construction of homology models that address the central questions of mechanism of active cation transport by all P-type cation pumps. This review relates recent evidence on functional sites of Na,K-ATPase for the substrate (ATP), the essential cofactor (Mg(2+) ions), and the transported cations (Na(+) and K(+)) to the molecular structure. The essential elements of the Ca-ATPase structure, including 10 transmembrane helices and well-defined N, P, and A cytoplasmic domains, are common to all PII-type pumps such as Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPases. However, for Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase, which consist of both alpha- and beta-subunits, there may be some detailed differences in regions of subunit interactions. Mutagenesis, proteolytic cleavage, and transition metal-catalyzed oxidative cleavages are providing much evidence about residues involved in binding of Na(+), K(+), ATP, and Mg(2+) ions and changes accompanying E1-E2 or E1-P-E2-P conformational transitions. We discuss this evidence in relation to N, P, and A cytoplasmic domain interactions, and long-range interactions between the active site and the Na(+) and K(+) sites in the transmembrane segments, for the different steps of the catalytic cycle.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Western populations, a higher level of fruit consumption has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, but little is known about such associations in China, where the consumption level is low and rates of stroke are high.
METHODS: Between 2004 and 2008, we recruited 512,891 adults, 30 to 79 years of age, from 10 diverse localities in China. During 3.2 million person-years of follow-up, 5173 deaths from cardiovascular disease, 2551 incident major coronary events (fatal or nonfatal), 14,579 ischemic strokes, and 3523 intracerebral hemorrhages were recorded among the 451,665 participants who did not have a history of cardiovascular disease or antihypertensive treatments at baseline. Cox regression yielded adjusted hazard ratios relating fresh fruit consumption to disease rates.
RESULTS: Overall, 18.0\% of participants reported consuming fresh fruit daily. As compared with participants who never or rarely consumed fresh fruit (the "nonconsumption" category), those who ate fresh fruit daily had lower systolic blood pressure (by 4.0 mm Hg) and blood glucose levels (by 0.5 mmol per liter [9.0 mg per deciliter]) (P{\textless}0.001 for trend for both comparisons). The adjusted hazard ratios for daily consumption versus nonconsumption were 0.60 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.67) for cardiovascular death, and 0.66 (95\% CI, 0.58 to 0.75), 0.75 (95\% CI, 0.72 to 0.79), and 0.64 (95\% CI, 0.56 to 0.74), respectively, for incident major coronary events, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. There was a strong log-linear dose-response relationship between the incidence of each outcome and the amount of fresh fruit consumed. These associations were similar across the 10 study regions and in subgroups of participants defined by baseline characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: Among Chinese adults, a higher level of fruit consumption was associated with lower blood pressure and blood glucose levels and, largely independent of these and other dietary and nondietary factors, with significantly lower risks of major cardiovascular diseases.

	abstract = {Recently, the European Food Safety Authority asserted that arachidonic acid (ARA) is an optional nutrient for the term infant even when docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is present. The brief rationale is based on an explicit, widespread misapplication of the concept of "essential fatty acids" to linoleic acid that implies it is uniquely required as a nutrient per se. Linoleic acid prevents acute clinical symptoms caused by polyunsaturated fatty acid-deficient diets and is the major precursor for ARA in most human diets. Experimental diets with ARA as the sole n-6 similarly prevent symptoms but at a lower energy percentage than linoleic acid and show ARA is a precursor for linoleic acid. The absence of consistent evidence of ARA benefit from randomized controlled trials is apparently an issue as well. This review highlights basic and clinical research relevant to ARA requirements as an adjunct to DHA in infancy. ARA is a major structural central nervous system component, where it rapidly accumulates perinatally and is required for signaling. Tracer studies show that ARA-fed infants derive about half of their total body ARA from dietary preformed ARA. Clinically, of the 3 cohorts of term infants studied with designs isolating the effects of ARA (DHA-only vs DHA+ARA), none considered ARA-specific outcomes such as vascular or immune function; the study with the highest ARA level showed significant neurocognitive benefit. All breastfed term infants of adequately nourished mothers consume both DHA and ARA. The burden of proof to substantially deviate from the composition of breastmilk is greater than that available from inherently empirical human randomized controlled trial evidence. Infant formulas with DHA but without ARA risk harm from suppression of ARA-mediated metabolism manifest among the many unstudied functions of ARA.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline or dementia is a debilitating problem of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, including special conditions like chemobrain. Dietary flavonoids proved to be efficacious in delaying the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. Two such flavonoids, naringin (NAR) and rutin (RUT) were reported to have neuroprotective potential with beneficial effects on spatial and emotional memories in particular. However, the efficacy of these flavonoids is poorly understood on episodic memory, which comprises an important form of autobiographical memory.
OBJECTIVE: This study objective is to evaluate NAR and RUT to reverse time-delay-induced long-term and scopolamine-induced short-term episodic memory deficits in Wistar rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have evaluated both short-term and long-term episodic memory forms using novel object recognition task. Open field paradigm was used to assess locomotor activity for any confounding influence on memory assessment. Donepezil was used as positive control and was effective in both models at 1 mg/kg, i.p.
RESULTS: Animals treated with NAR and RUT at 50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o. spent significantly more time exploring novel object compared to familiar one, whereas control animals spent almost equal time with both objects in choice trial. NAR and RUT dose-dependently increased recognition and discriminative indices in time-induced long-term as well as scopolamine-induced short-term episodic memory deficit models without interfering with the locomotor activity.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that, NAR and RUT averted both short- and long-term episodic memory deficits in Wistar rats, which may be potential interventions for neurodegenerative diseases as well as chemobrain condition.
SUMMARY: Incidence of Alzheimer's disease is increasing globally and the current therapy is only symptomatic. Curative treatment is a major lacuna. NAR and RUT are natural flavonoids proven for their pleiotropic pharmacological effects with potential neuroprotective benefits. The study evaluated these flavonoids for their potential to improve the most common form of episodic memory (memory of autobiographical events in relation to time, places etc.) in two differential animal models assessing short-term and long-term memory, respectively. We also found that NAR and RUT were able to reverse both short-term and long-term memory deficits dose dependently in female Wistar rats.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary nitrate is receiving increased attention due to its reported ergogenic and cardioprotective properties. The extent to which ingestion of various nitrate-rich vegetables increases postprandial plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations and lowers blood pressure is currently unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the impact of ingesting different nitrate-rich vegetables on subsequent plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations and resting blood pressure in healthy normotensive individuals.
METHODS: With the use of a semirandomized crossover design, 11 men and 7 women [mean ± SEM age: 28 ± 1 y; mean ± SEM body mass index (BMI, in kg/m(2)): 23 ± 1; exercise: 1-10 h/wk] ingested 4 different beverages, each containing 800 mg (∼12.9 mmol) nitrate: sodium nitrate (NaNO3), concentrated beetroot juice, a rocket salad beverage, and a spinach beverage. Plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations and blood pressure were determined before and up to 300 min after beverage ingestion. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA.
RESULTS: Plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations increased after ingestion of all 4 beverages (P {\textless} 0.001). Peak plasma nitrate concentrations were similar for all treatments (all values presented as means ± SEMs: NaNO3: 583 ± 29 μmol/L; beetroot juice: 597 ± 23 μmol/L; rocket salad beverage: 584 ± 24 μmol/L; spinach beverage: 584 ± 23 μmol/L). Peak plasma nitrite concentrations were different between treatments (NaNO3: 580 ± 58 nmol/L; beetroot juice: 557 ± 57 nmol/L; rocket salad beverage: 643 ± 63 nmol/L; spinach beverage: 980 ± 160 nmol/L; P = 0.016). When compared with baseline, systolic blood pressure declined 150 min after ingestion of beetroot juice (from 118 ± 2 to 113 ± 2 mm Hg; P {\textless} 0.001) and rocket salad beverage (from 122 ± 3 to 116 ± 2 mm Hg; P = 0.007) and 300 min after ingestion of spinach beverage (from 118 ± 2 to 111 ± 3 mm Hg; P {\textless} 0.001), but did not change with NaNO3 Diastolic blood pressure declined 150 min after ingestion of all beverages (P {\textless} 0.05) and remained lower at 300 min after ingestion of rocket salad (P = 0.045) and spinach (P = 0.001) beverages.
CONCLUSIONS: Ingestion of nitrate-rich beetroot juice, rocket salad beverage, and spinach beverage effectively increases plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations and lowers blood pressure to a greater extent than sodium nitrate. These findings show that nitrate-rich vegetables can be used as dietary nitrate supplements. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02271633.},

	abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) comprises a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders that begin in early childhood. They are characterized by differences in behavior and delays in communication and affect at least 1\% of children. Observational studies have now confirmed that behaviors of a substantial percentage of children with autism tend to improve with the onset of febrile illness, which might be the downstream effects of altered metabolic pathways involving increased expression of heat shock proteins (HSP) and cellular stress responses. Sulforaphane, a phytochemical derived from a number of cruciferous vegetables, most notably broccoli sprouts, has metabolic effects that in some ways resemble that of fever. This review paper discusses this "fever effect" and the intracellular effects of sulforaphane as well as the results of our recent clinical trial of sulforaphane in young adults with autism. The accompanying review by Liu et al. describes the cellular actions of sulforaphane and potential biomarkers in the study of ASD.},

The medico-economic burdens of ASD are enormous, and no recognized treatment targets the core features of ASD. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial, young men (aged 13–27) with moderate to severe ASD received the phytochemical sulforaphane (n = 29)—derived from broccoli sprout extracts—or indistinguishable placebo (n = 15). The effects on behavior of daily oral doses of sulforaphane (50–150 µmol) for 18 wk, followed by 4 wk without treatment, were quantified by three widely accepted behavioral measures completed by parents/caregivers and physicians: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I). Initial scores for ABC and SRS were closely matched for participants assigned to placebo and sulforaphane. After 18 wk, participants receiving placebo experienced minimal change ({\textless}3.3\%), whereas those receiving sulforaphane showed substantial declines (improvement of behavior): 34\% for ABC (P {\textless} 0.001, comparing treatments) and 17\% for SRS scores (P = 0.017). On CGI-I, a significantly greater number of participants receiving sulforaphane had improvement in social interaction, abnormal behavior, and verbal communication (P = 0.015–0.007). Upon discontinuation of sulforaphane, total scores on all scales rose toward pretreatment levels. Dietary sulforaphane, of recognized low toxicity, was selected for its capacity to reverse abnormalities that have been associated with ASD, including oxidative stress and lower antioxidant capacity, depressed glutathione synthesis, reduced mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation, increased lipid peroxidation, and neuroinflammmation.},

	abstract = {Background. Alcohol consumption is a lifestyle factor associated with type 2 diabetes. This relationship is reportedly different depending on the type of alcohol beverage. The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of traditional Japanese alcohol beverages on biochemical parameters, physical and emotional state, and sleep patterns. Methods. Six healthy subjects (three men and three women; age, 28.8 ± 9.5 years; body mass index, 21.4 ± 1.6 kg/m(2)) consumed three different types of alcohol beverages (beer, shochu, and sake, each with 40 g ethanol) or mineral water with dinner on different days in the hospital. Blood samples were collected before and 1, 2, and 12 h after drinking each beverage, and assessments of physical and emotional state were administered at the same time. In addition, sleep patterns and brain waves were examined using polysomnography. Results. Blood glucose levels at 1 h and the 12-h area under the curve (AUC) value after drinking shochu were significantly lower than that with water and beer. The 12-h blood insulin AUC value after drinking shochu was significantly lower than that with beer. Blood glucose × insulin level at 1 h and the 2-h blood glucose × insulin AUC value with shochu were significantly lower than that with beer. The insulinogenic indexes at 2 h with beer and sake, but not shochu, were significantly higher than that with water. The visual analogue scale scores of physical and emotional state showed that the tipsiness levels with beer, shochu, and sake at 1 h were significantly higher than that with water. These tipsiness levels were maintained at 2 h. The polysomnography showed that the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency with shochu and sake were shorter than that with water and beer. Conclusions. Acute consumption of alcohol beverages with a meal resulted in different responses in postprandial glucose and insulin levels as well as REM sleep latency. Alcohol beverage type should be taken into consideration for people with impaired glucose tolerance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cacao bean husk ethanol extract (CBHEE) has polyphenol that acts as an antibacterial agent, specially anti-glucosyltransferase.
AIM: This study is aimed to see the effectiveness of CBHEE to reduce the number of mutans streptococci colonies in the saliva of children (with young permanent teeth), when CBHE is used as mouth rinse.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used cross-sectional study design with time-series experimental study and used simple random sampling on 30 subjects. The chosen subjects are those who have middle oral hygiene status (OHI-S). Each subject was given the same intervention; in the first step, saliva was collected from the subjects (prior to intervention), in the second step, the subjects were given 15 mL of CBHEE 0.1\% mouth rinse to rinse their mouth for about 30 s. After intervention, their saliva was collected twice in 15 min and 30 min after intervention. Furthermore, the number of mutans streptococci colonies were measured in colony-forming units (CFU) and the data was statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t-test. The data was analyzed and processed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 22.0 for windows versions.
RESULTS: The data statistically showed, significantly, the reduction of Streptococcus mutans colonies before and after 30 min of intervention. Before intervention, there were 59.10 CFU/mL of mutans streptococci, and after 15 min of intervention it showed reduction of mutans streptococci to 25.73 CFU/mL and after 30 min of intervention, the counts of mutans streptococci showed a reduction to 9.40 CFU/mL. From the test results, statistical value of this research was P = 0.000 (P {\textless} 0.05), which means that the reduction of the mutans streptococci count was significant.
CONCLUSION: Using CBHEE as mouth rinse for children has been proven highly effective in reducing mutans streptococci colony counts in the mouth.},

	abstract = {Influenza is one of the most common human respiratory diseases, and represents a serious public health concern. However, the high mutability of influenza viruses has hampered vaccine development, and resistant strains to existing anti-viral drugs have also emerged. Novel anti-influenza therapies are urgently needed, and in this study, we describe the anti-viral properties of a Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) cold water extract. Anti-viral effects have previously been reported for extracts and specific substances derived from Spirulina, and here we show that this Spirulina cold water extract has low cellular toxicity, and is well-tolerated in animal models at one dose as high as 5,000 mg/kg, or 3,000 mg/kg/day for 14 successive days. Anti-flu efficacy studies revealed that the Spirulina extract inhibited viral plaque formation in a broad range of influenza viruses, including oseltamivir-resistant strains. Spirulina extract was found to act at an early stage of infection to reduce virus yields in cells and improve survival in influenza-infected mice, with inhibition of influenza hemagglutination identified as one of the mechanisms involved. Together, these results suggest that the cold water extract of Spirulina might serve as a safe and effective therapeutic agent to manage influenza outbreaks, and further clinical investigation may be warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: One of the challenges of international alcohol research and policy is the variability in and lack of knowledge of how governments in different nations define a standard drink and low-risk drinking. This study gathered such information from governmental agencies in 37 countries.
METHODS: A pool of 75 countries that might have definitions was created using World Health Organization (WHO) information and the authors' own judgement. Structured internet searches of relevant terms for each country were supplemented by efforts to contact government agencies directly and to consult with alcohol experts in the country.
RESULTS: Most of the 75 national governments examined were not identified as having adopted a standard drink definition. Among the 37 that were so identified, the modal standard drink size was 10 g pure ethanol, but variation was wide (8-20 g). Significant variability was also evident for low-risk drinking guidelines, ranging from 10-42 g per day for women and 10-56 g per day for men to 98-140 g per week for women and 150-280 g per week for men.
CONCLUSIONS: Researchers working and communicating across national boundaries should be sensitive to the substantial variability in 'standard' drink definitions and low-risk drinking guidelines. The potential impact of guidelines, both in general and in specific national cases, remains an important question for public health research.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous meta-analyses of cohort studies indicate a J-shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and allcause mortality, with reduced risk for low-volume drinkers. However, low-volume drinkers may appear healthy only because the "abstainers" with whom they are compared are biased toward ill health. The purpose of this study was to determine whether misclassifying former and occasional drinkers as abstainers and other potentially confounding study characteristics underlie observed positive health outcomes for lowvolume drinkers in prospective studies of all-cause mortality.
METHOD: A systematic review and meta-regression analysis of studies investigating alcohol use and mortality risk after controlling for quality-related study characteristics was conducted in a population of 3,998,626 individuals, among whom 367,103 deaths were recorded.
RESULTS: Without adjustment, meta-analysis of all 87 included studies replicated the classic J-shaped curve, with low-volume drinkers (1.3-24.9 g ethanol per day) having reduced mortality risk (RR = 0.86, 95\% CI [0.83, 0.90]). Occasional drinkers ({\textless}1.3 g per day) had similar mortality risk (RR = 0.84, 95\% CI [0.79, 0.89]), and former drinkers had elevated risk (RR = 1.22, 95\% CI [1.14, 1.31]). After adjustment for abstainer biases and quality-related study characteristics, no significant reduction in mortality risk was observed for low-volume drinkers (RR = 0.97, 95\% CI [0.88, 1.07]). Analyses of higher-quality bias-free studies also failed to find reduced mortality risk for low-volume alcohol drinkers. Risk estimates for occasional drinkers were similar to those for low- and medium-volume drinkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of mortality risk from alcohol are significantly altered by study design and characteristics. Meta-analyses adjusting for these factors find that low-volume alcohol consumption has no net mortality benefit compared with lifetime abstention or occasional drinking. These findings have implications for public policy, the formulation of low-risk drinking guidelines, and future research on alcohol and health.},

MATERIALS/METHODS: In this 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, parallel clinical trials were performed in overweight and obese Korean subjects. Randomly assigned subjects were instructed to take daily either the placebo (male, 6 and female, 30) or OPE capsules containing 100 mg of quercetin (male, 5 and female, 31). Body composition was measured by using bioimpedance and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Resting energy expenditure (REE) and respiratory quotient (RQ) were evaluated by using indirect calorie measurement methods. Fasting blood levels of glucose, insulin, lipids, and leptin were determined.
RESULTS: Quercetin-rich OPE supplementation significantly reduced the weight and percentage of body fat as measured by DXA (P = 0.02). These effects were not shown in the control group. Levels of blood glucose (P = 0.04) and leptin (P = 0.001 for placebo, P = 0.002 for OPE) decreased in both groups. Significant increases in REE and RQ were observed in both groups (P = 0.003 for placebo, P = 0.006 for OPE) and in the OPE group alone (P = 0.02), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Quercetin-rich OPE supplementation changed the body composition of the overweight and obese subjects. This result suggests a beneficial role of the anti-obesity effect of OPE human subjects.},

The mice were fed a high-fat diet (60\% kcal as fat) supplemented with XN at dose levels of 0, 30, or 60 mg/kg body weight/day, for 12 weeks. Dietary XN caused a dose-dependent decrease in body weight gain. Plasma levels of glucose, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, and MCP-1 were significantly decreased in mice on the 60 mg/kg/day treatment regimen. Treatment with XN at 60 mg/kg/day resulted in reduced plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), IL-6, insulin and leptin levels by 80\%, 78\%, 42\%, and 41\%, respectively, compared to the vehicle control group. Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin 9 (PCSK-9) levels were 44\% lower in the 60 mg/kg dose group compared to the vehicle control group (p ≤ 0.05) which may account for the LDL-C lowering activity of XN.

	abstract = {The number of Americans older than 65 years old is projected to more than double in the next 40 years. Cognitive changes associated to aging can affect an adult's day-to-day functioning. Among these cognitive changes, reasoning, episodic memory, working memory, and processing speed decline gradually over time. Early memory changes include a decline in both working and episodic memory. The aim of the present study was to determine whether chronic (up to 75 days) daily administration of wild blueberry extract or a wild blueberry full spectrum powder would help prevent memory failure associated with aging in tasks involving various forms of memory. Both blueberry ingredients were used in a study comparing young mice (6 months old) to aged mice (18 months old). At this age, mice exhibit memory decline due to aging, which is exacerbated first by a loss in working and contextual (episodic-like) memory. Contextual memory (episodic-like memory) was evaluated using the contextual serial discrimination test. Working and spatial memory were evaluated using the Morris-Water maze test and the sequential alternation test. Statistical analysis was performed using an ANOVA with the Bonferroni post-hoc test. Supplementation with wild blueberry full spectrum powder and wild blueberry extract resulted in significant improvement of contextual memory, while untreated aged mice experienced a decline in such memory. Only the wild blueberry full spectrum powder significantly contributed to an improvement of spatial and working memory versus untreated aged mice. These improvements of cognitive performance may be related to brain oxidative status, acetylcholinesterase activity, neuroprotection, or attenuation of immunoreactivity.},

	abstract = {The gut microbiota is found to be strongly associated with atherosclerosis (AS). Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural phytoalexin with anti-AS effects; however, its mechanisms of action remain unclear. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the anti-AS effects of RSV were related to changes in the gut microbiota. We found that RSV attenuated trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)-induced AS in ApoE(-/-) mice. Meanwhile, RSV decreased TMAO levels by inhibiting commensal microbial trimethylamine (TMA) production via gut microbiota remodeling in mice. Moreover, RSV increased levels of the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which increased the bile salt hydrolase activity, thereby enhancing bile acid (BA) deconjugation and fecal excretion in C57BL/6J and ApoE(-/-) mice. This was associated with a decrease in ileal BA content, repression of the enterohepatic farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) axis, and increased cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression and hepatic BA neosynthesis. An FXR antagonist had the same effect on FGF15 and CYP7A1 expression as RSV, while an FXR agonist abolished RSV-induced alterations in FGF15 and CYP7A1 expression. In mice treated with antibiotics, RSV neither decreased TMAO levels nor increased hepatic BA synthesis. Additionally, RSV-induced inhibition of TMAO-caused AS was also markedly abolished by antibiotics. In conclusion, RSV attenuated TMAO-induced AS by decreasing TMAO levels and increasing hepatic BA neosynthesis via gut microbiota remodeling, and the BA neosynthesis was partially mediated through the enterohepatic FXR-FGF15 axis.
IMPORTANCE: Recently, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) has been identified as a novel and independent risk factor for promoting atherosclerosis (AS) partially through inhibiting hepatic bile acid (BA) synthesis. The gut microbiota plays a key role in the pathophysiology of TMAO-induced AS. Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural phytoalexin with prebiotic benefits. A growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that phenolic phytochemicals with poor bioavailability are possibly acting primarily through remodeling of the gut microbiota. The current study showed that RSV attenuated TMAO-induced AS by decreasing TMAO levels and increasing hepatic BA neosynthesis via gut microbiota remodeling. And RSV-induced hepatic BA neosynthesis was partially mediated through downregulating the enterohepatic farnesoid X receptor-fibroblast growth factor 15 axis. These results offer new insights into the mechanisms responsible for RSV's anti-AS effects and indicate that the gut microbiota may become an interesting target for pharmacological or dietary interventions to decrease the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.},

Here we employ systems nutrigenomics to scrutinize the genomic bases of nutrientâ€“host interaction underlying disease predisposition or therapeutic potential. We conducted transcriptome and epigenome sequencing of hypothalamus (metabolic control) and hippocampus (cognitive processing) from a rodent model of fructose consumption, and identified significant reprogramming of DNA methylation, transcript abundance, alternative splicing, and gene networks governing cell metabolism, cell communication, inflammation, and neuronal signaling. These signals converged with genetic causal risks of metabolic, neurological, and psychiatric disorders revealed in humans. Gene network modeling uncovered the extracellular matrix genes \textit{Bgn} and \textit{Fmod} as main orchestrators of the effects of fructose, as validated using two knockout mouse models. We further demonstrate that an omega-3 fatty acid, DHA, reverses the genomic and network perturbations elicited by fructose, providing molecular support for nutritional interventions to counteract diet-induced metabolic and brain disorders. Our integrative approach complementing rodent and human studies supports the applicability of nutrigenomics principles to predict disease susceptibility and to guide personalized medicine.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sleep deprivation is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Cocoa flavonoids exert cardiovascular benefits and neuroprotection. Whether chocolate consumption may mitigate detrimental effects of sleep loss on cognitive performance and cardiovascular parameters has never been studied.
AIM: We investigated the effects of flavanol-rich chocolate consumption on cognitive skills and cardiovascular parameters after sleep deprivation.
METHODS: Thirty-two healthy participants underwent two baseline sessions after one night of undisturbed sleep and two experimental sessions after one night of total sleep deprivation. Two hours before each testing session, participants were randomly assigned to consume high or poor flavanol chocolate bars. During the tests were evaluated, the Psychomotor Vigilance Task and a working memory task, office SBP and DBP, flow-mediated dilation and pulse-wave velocity.
RESULTS: Sleep deprivation increased SBP/DBP. SBP/DBP and pulse pressure were lower after flavanol-rich treatment respect to flavanol-poor treatment (SBP: 116.9 ± 1.6 vs. 120.8 ± 1.9 mmHg, respectively, P = 0.00005; DBP: 70.5 ± 1.2 vs. 72.3 ± 1.2 mmHg, respectively, P = 0.01; pulse pressure: 46.4 ± 1.3 vs. 48.4 ± 1.5 mmHg, P = 0.004). Sleep deprivation impaired flow-mediated dilation (5.5 ± 0.5 vs. 6.5 ± 0.6\%, P = 0.02), flavanol-rich, but not flavanol-poor chocolate counteracted this alteration (flavanol-rich/flavanol-poor chocolate: 7.0 ± 0.6 vs. 5.0 ± 0.4\%, P = 0.000001). Flavanol-rich chocolate mitigated the pulse-wave velocity increase (P = 0.001). Flavanol-rich chocolate preserved working memory accuracy in women after sleep deprivation. Flow-mediated dilation correlated with working memory performance accuracy in the sleep condition (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Flavanol-rich chocolate counteracted vascular impairment after sleep deprivation and restored working memory performance. Improvement in cognitive performance could be because of the effects of cocoa flavonoids on blood pressure and peripheral and central blood flow.},

The study enrolled 60 healthy non-smoker males and females aged 40-65 years, all of whom showed clinical signs of skin aging. The subjects were randomly divided into two matched groups, and were administered FPP or antioxidant treatment of a 4.5 g/day sachet sublingually twice a day for 90 days in a double-blind fashion. The parameters investigated were: Skin surface, brown spots, skin evenness, skin moisturization, elasticity (face), redox balance, nitric oxide (NO) concentration, and the expression levels of key genes (outer forearm sample). As compared with the baseline (day 0) and antioxidant-control values, FPP-treated subjects showed a significant improvement in skin evenness, moisturization and elasticity. The two treatments improved the MDA and SOD skin concentrations, but only the FPP-treated group showed a higher SOD level and a significant NO increase, along with significant upregulation of acquaporin-3 and downregulation of the potentially pro-aging/carcinogenetic cyclophilin-A and CD147 genes (P{\textless}0.05). Progerin was unaffected in both treatment groups. In conclusion, these findings suggest that orally-administered FPP showed a consistent biological and gene-regulatory improvement in the skin, as was also demonstrated in previous experimental and clinical trials testing other tissues, while common oral antioxidants had only a minor effect.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.numecd.2016.03.003},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Progressive microvascular dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may impair the ability of cerebral vessels to supply blood to brain regions during local metabolic demand, thereby increasing risks of dementia. Having previously demonstrated that resveratrol can enhance vasodilator function in the systemic circulation, we hypothesised that resveratrol could similarly benefit the cerebral circulation. We aimed to determine the most efficacious dose of resveratrol to improve cerebral vasodilator responsiveness (CVR) in T2DM.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced crossover intervention, 36 dementia-free, non-insulin dependent T2DM older adults (49-78 years old) consumed single doses of synthetic trans-resveratrol (0, 75, 150, and 300 mg) at weekly intervals. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound was used to assess CVR to a hypercapnic stimulus, both before and 45 min after treatment. CVR, measured bilaterally in the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) and posterior cerebral arteries (PCA), was expressed as the percentage change in mean blood flow velocity from baseline to the peak velocity attained during hypercapnia. Resveratrol consumption increased CVR in the MCA; mean within-individual changes for each dose from placebo were 13.8 ± 3.5\% for 75 mg (P = 0.001), 8.9 ± 3.5\% for 150 mg (P = 0.016), and 13.7 ± 3.3\% for 300 mg (P {\textless} 0.001); only the 75 mg dose was efficacious in the PCA (13.2 ± 4.5\%, P = 0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first clinical evidence of an acute enhancement of vasodilator responsiveness in cerebral vessels following consumption of resveratrol in this population who are known to have endothelial dysfunction and sub-clinical cognitive impairment. Importantly, maximum improvement was observed with the lowest dose used.

In the present study, we investigated whether the tobacco carcinogen 4-(N-methyl-N-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) induces lesions in both lungs and livers of ferrets with or without lycopene intervention. Male ferrets (6 groups, n = 8-10) were treated either with NNK (50 mg/kg BW, i.p., once a month for four consecutive months) or saline with or without dietary lycopene supplementation (2.2 and 6.6 mg/kg BW/day, respectively) for 26 weeks. Results demonstrate that NNK exposure results in higher incidences of lung tumors, HCC and steatohepatitis (which is characterized by severe inflammatory cell infiltration with concurrent fat accumulation in liver, hepatocellular ballooning degeneration and increased NF-κB expression), as well as elevations in bilirubin and AST levels in ferrets. Lycopene supplementation at two doses prevented NNK-induced expressions of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the lung and NF-κB and CYP2E1 in the liver and attenuated the NNK-induced mortality and pathological lesions in both the lungs and livers of ferrets. The present study provided strong experimental evidence that the tobacco carcinogen NNK can induce both HCC and steatohepatitis in the ferrets and can be a useful model for studying tobacco carcinogen-associated NAFLD and liver cancer.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effect of licorice-root extract on carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in individuals with hypercholesterolemia.
DESIGN: Individuals with hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol ≥6.18 mmol/L [240 mg/dL]) and without significant stenosis were randomly allocated to two groups: an experimental group that consumed 0.2 g/day of ethanolic extract of licorice root for 12 months, and a control group that received a placebo.
RESULTS: Of 110 eligible participants, 94 (41-80 years old) completed the study. A significant CIMT decrease from 0.92±0.25 mm to 0.84±0.21 mm was observed in the experimental group compared with an increase from 0.85±0.17 mm to 0.88±0.19 mm in the control group.

CONCLUSION: Following 1 year of licorice consumption, mean CIMT, total cholesterol, LDL levels, and blood pressure were decreased. This suggests that licorice may attenuate the development of atherosclerosis and of related cardiovascular diseases.},

	abstract = {The anabolic effects of nutrition on skeletal muscle may depend on adequate skeletal muscle perfusion, which is impaired in older people. Cocoa flavanols have been shown to improve flow-mediated dilation, an established measure of endothelial function. However, their effect on muscle microvascular blood flow is currently unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore links between the consumption of cocoa flavanols, muscle microvascular blood flow, and muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in response to nutrition in older men. To achieve this objective, leg blood flow (LBF), muscle microvascular blood volume (MBV), and MPS were measured under postabsorptive and postprandial (intravenous Glamin (Fresenius Kabi, Germany), dextrose to sustain glucose ∼7.5 mmol·L(-1)) conditions in 20 older men. Ten of these men were studied with no cocoa flavanol intervention and a further 10 were studied with the addition of 350 mg of cocoa flavanols at the same time that nutrition began. Leg (femoral artery) blood flow was measured by Doppler ultrasound, muscle MBV by contrast-enhanced ultrasound using Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging, Mass., USA) perflutren contrast agent and MPS using [1, 2-(13)C2]leucine tracer techniques. Our results show that although older individuals do not show an increase in LBF or MBV in response to feeding, these absent responses are apparent when cocoa flavanols are given acutely with nutrition. However, this restoration in vascular responsiveness is not associated with improved MPS responses to nutrition. We conclude that acute cocoa flavanol supplementation improves muscle macro- and microvascular responses to nutrition, independently of modifying muscle protein anabolism.},

The polyphenol epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG) can interfere with painful disc degeneration by reducing inflammation, catabolism, and pain. In this study, we hypothesized that EGCG furthermore protects against senescence and/or cell death, induced by oxidative stress. Sublethal and lethal oxidative stress were induced in primary human intervertebral disc cells with H2O2 (total n = 36). Under sublethal conditions, the effects of EGCG on p53-p21 activation, proliferative capacity, and accumulation of senescence-associated β-galactosidase were tested. Further, the effects of EGCG on mitochondria depolarization and cell viability were analyzed in lethal oxidative stress. The inhibitor LY249002 was applied to investigate the PI3K/Akt pathway. EGCG inhibited accumulation of senescence-associated β-galactosidase but did not affect the loss of proliferative capacity, suggesting that EGCG did not fully neutralize exogenous radicals. Furthermore, EGCG increased the survival of IVD cells in lethal oxidative stress via activation of prosurvival PI3K/Akt and protection of mitochondria. We demonstrated that EGCG not only inhibits inflammation but also can enhance the survival of disc cells in oxidative stress, which makes it a suitable candidate for the development of novel therapies targeting disc degeneration.},

Proteomics of cardiovascular tissues such as aorta or heart represents a promising tool to uncover the mechanisms of action of phenolic compounds in healthy animals.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve female Wistar rats were separated into three groups: a standard diet and two diets supplemented in phenolic compounds (HT and SEC) adjusted to 5 mg/kg/day during 21 days. Proteomic analyses of aorta and heart tissues were performed by nano-LC and MS. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to generate interaction networks. HT or SEC modulated aorta and heart proteome compared to the standard diet. The top-scored networks were related to Cardiovascular System. HT and SEC downregulated proteins related to proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and occlusion of blood vessels in aorta and proteins related to heart failure in heart tissue. SEC showed higher fold change values compared to HT, attributed to higher concentration of HT detected in heart tissue.
CONCLUSION: Changes at proteomic level in cardiovascular tissues may partially account for the underlying mechanisms of VOO phenols cardiovascular protection being the SEC effects higher than free HT.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous cell-based and animal studies showed mixed tocotrienols are neuroprotective, but the effect is yet to be proven in humans. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the protective activity of mixed tocotrienols in humans with white matter lesions (WMLs). WMLs are regarded as manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease, reflecting varying degrees of neurodegeneration and tissue damage with potential as a surrogate end point in clinical trials.
METHODS: A total of 121 volunteers aged â‰¥35 years with cardiovascular risk factors and MRI-confirmed WMLs were randomized to receive 200 mg mixed tocotrienols or placebo twice a day for 2 years. The WML volumes were measured from MRI images taken at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years using a validated software and were compared. Fasting blood samples were collected for full blood chemistry investigation.
RESULTS: According to per-protocol (88 volunteers) and intention-to-treat (121 volunteers) analyses, the mean WML volume of the placebo group increased after 2 years, whereas that of the tocotrienol-supplemented group remained essentially unchanged. The mean WML volume change between the 2 groups was not significantly different (P=0.150) at the end of 1 year but was significant at the end of 2 years for both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses (P=0.019 and P=0.018). No significant difference was observed in the blood chemistry parameters between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Mixed tocotrienols were found to attenuate the progression of WMLs.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Some researchers found decreased levels of plasma taurine in obese subjects and animals, and reduced expression of an important enzyme of taurine synthesis. These evidences, coupled with the metabolic imbalance of obesity and the possible anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of taurine, highlighted the use of taurine as a supplement in obesity treatment. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether taurine supplementation, associated with nutritional counseling, modulates oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and glucose homeostasis in obese women.
METHODS: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted with 16 women with obesity diagnosis and 8 women in the normal weight range. The obese volunteers were matched by age and body mass index and randomly assigned to either the placebo (3 g/day starch flour) or taurine (3 g/day taurine) group. The study lasted 8 weeks, and the experimental protocol included nutritional assessment and determination of plasma sulfur amino acids, insulin, and adiponectin, serum glycemia, and markers of inflammatory response and oxidative stress.
RESULTS: Plasma taurine levels were significantly decreased (41\%) in the obese volunteers. Both the placebo and taurine groups showed significant reduction in weight (3\%), with no differences between groups. Different from placebo, taurine-supplemented group showed significant increase in plasma taurine (97\%) and adiponectin (12\%) and significant reduction in the inflammatory marker hs-C-reactive protein (29\%) and in the lipid peroxidation marker thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (20\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Eight weeks of taurine supplementation associated with nutritional counseling is able to increase adiponectin levels and to decrease markers of inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) and lipid peroxidation (TBARS) in obese women.},

The current analysis is to understand the reasons for variability of the H₂O₂-induced DNA damage recorded after Se supplementation. We have looked at the variation of demographic, lifestyle, medication, genetic and dietary factors and biomarkers measured at baseline and post-supplementation in these two extreme subgroups A and B. Group A showed increased H₂O₂-induced DNA damage and group B showed decreased damage after Se supplementation. We have also considered correlations of biomarkers and dietary factors in the complete dataset. The glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and DNA damage were significantly lower at post-supplementation in Group B compared to Group A. Post-supplementation, Group B showed a significant reduction in the GPx activity, while Group A showed a significant increase in DNA damage compared to baseline levels. Dietary methionine intake was significantly higher and folate intake was significantly lower in Group B compared to Group A. Se supplementation significantly increased the caspase-cleaved keratin 18 levels in both groups, indicating increased apoptotic potential of this supplement. Parameter correlation with the complete dataset showed dietary methionine to have a significant negative correlation with H₂O₂-induced DNA damage post-supplementation. The data suggest that Se supplementation is beneficial for the leukocyte DNA integrity only in interaction with the dietary methionine and folate intake.},

Continuous generation of NO is essential for the integrity of the cardiovascular system. The aim of this study was to assess whether oral intake of a nitrate (NO3-)-rich dietary supplement (amaranth extract) is able to increase NO3- and nitrite (NO2-) levels in blood plasma and saliva of healthy adults.
METHODS: In the present study, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of NO3- and NO2- from amaranth extract (2 g as single dose) was studied in 16 healthy individuals and compared with placebo in a crossover design. The NO3- and NO2- levels in plasma as well as saliva were measured up to 24 h.
RESULTS: After administration of amaranth extract, the NO3- levels in plasma as well as saliva were found to be significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) higher than in the placebo group. The NO2- level in plasma was slightly higher (P {\textless} 0.05) in the amaranth group (test group) compared with that in the placebo group, whereas the saliva NO2- level was significantly high (P {\textless} 0.001) in the amaranth extract-treated group than the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS: These results clearly indicate that a single oral dose of amaranth extract is able to increase the NO3- and NO2- levels in the body for at least 8 h. The increase in NO3- and NO2- levels can help to improve the overall performance of people involved in vigorous physical activities or sports.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinically used antidepressants suffer from various side effects. Therefore, we searched for a safe antidepressant with minimal side effects among food ingredients that are distributed to the brain. Here, we focused on ERGO (ergothioneine), which is a hydrophilic antioxidant and contained at high levels in edible golden oyster mushrooms. ERGO is a typical substrate of carnitine/organic cation transporter OCTN1/SLC22A4, which is expressed in the brain and neuronal stem cells, although little is known about its permeation through the BBB (blood-brain barrier) or its neurological activity.
METHODS: To clarify the exposure of ERGO to brain and the possible antidepressant-like effect after oral ingestion, ERGO or GOME (golden oyster mushroom extract) which contains 1.2\% (w/w) ERGO was mixed with feed and provided to mice for 2 weeks, and then ERGO concentration and antidepressant-like effect were evaluated by LC-MS/MS and FST (forced swimming test) or TST (tail suspension test), respectively.
RESULTS: Diet containing ERGO or GOME greatly increased the ERGO concentrations in plasma and brain, and significantly decreased the immobility time in both FST and TST. The required amount of GOME ({\textasciitilde}37 mg/day) to show the antidepressant-like effect corresponds to at most 8 g/day in humans. In mice receiving GOME-containing diet, doublecortin-positive cells showed a significant increase from the basal level, suggesting promotion of neuronal differentiation.
CONCLUSION: Thus, orally ingested ERGO is transported across the BBB into the brain, where it may promote neuronal differentiation and alleviate symptoms of depression at plausibly achieved level of daily ingestion.},

In another experiment, rats were supplemented for 4weeks with TAG-DHA (fish oil), PL-DHA (roe PL) or a mixture of both for comparison to a low-omega-3 diet. Brain regions and other tissues were collected, and blood was sampled weekly. DHA accretion rates were estimated using the balance method. [U-(3)H]PL-DHA rats had higher radioactivity in cerebellum, hippocampus and remainder of brain, with no differences in other tissues despite higher serum lipid radioactivity in [U-(3)H]TAG-DHA rats. TAG-DHA, PL-DHA or a mixture were equally effective at increasing brain DHA. There were no differences between DHA-supplemented groups in brain region, whole-body, or tissue DHA accretion rates except heart and serum TAG where the PL-DHA/TAG-DHA blend was higher than TAG-DHA. Apparent DHA β-oxidation was not different between DHA-supplemented groups.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Choline is an essential nutrient and plays a critical role in brain development, cell signaling, nerve impulse transmission, and lipid transport and metabolism. This analysis aimed to assess usual intakes of choline and compare them with the dietary reference intakes for U.S. residents aged ≥ 2 years.
METHODS: The National Cancer Institute method was used to assess usual intakes of choline from foods according to data for participants in the 2009-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; n = 16,809).
RESULTS: Suboptimal intakes of choline are prevalent across many life-stage subpopulations in the United States. Only 10.8 ± 0.6\% of 2009-2012 NHANES participants aged ≥ 2 years (15.6 ± 0.8\% of males and 6.1 ± 0.6\% of females) achieved the adequate intake (AI) for choline. Children aged 2-3 years were the most likely to exceed the AI (62.9 ± 3.1\%), followed by children aged 4-8 years (45.4 ± 1.6\%) and children aged 9-13 years (9.0 ± 1.0\%), compared to adolescents aged 14-18 years (1.8 ± 0.4\%) and adults aged ≥ 19 years (6.6 ± 0.5\%). When comparing by age and gender, males consumed significantly more choline than females for all age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that there is a need to increase awareness among health professionals and consumers regarding potential suboptimal intakes of choline in the United States, as well as the critical role that choline plays in health maintenance throughout the lifespan. Food scientists and the food and dietary supplement industries should consider working collectively with government agencies to discuss strategies to help offset the percentage of the population that does not meet the AI. Revision of the dietary reference intakes for choline should include replacement of the AI with an estimated average requirement and a recommended dietary allowance, so that more accurate population estimates of inadequate intakes may be calculated.},

	abstract = {Objective: Choline is an essential nutrient and plays a critical role in brain development, cell signaling, nerve impulse transmission, and lipid transport and metabolism. This analysis aimed to assess usual intakes of choline and compare them with the dietary reference intakes for U.S. residents aged ≥2 years.Methods: The National Cancer Institute method was used to assess usual intakes of choline from foods according to data for participants in the 2009–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; n = 16,809).Results: Suboptimal intakes of choline are prevalent across many life-stage subpopulations in the United States. Only 10.8 ± 0.6\% of 2009–2012 NHANES participants aged ≥2 years (15.6 ± 0.8\% of males and 6.1 ± 0.6\% of females) achieved the adequate intake (AI) for choline. Children aged 2–3 years were the most likely to exceed the AI (62.9 ± 3.1\%), followed by children aged 4–8 years (45.4 ± 1.6\%) and children aged 9–13 years (9.0 ± 1.0\%), compared to adolescents aged 14–18 years (1.8 ± 0.4\%) and adults aged ≥19 years (6.6 ± 0.5\%). When comparing by age and gender, males consumed significantly more choline than females for all age groups.Conclusions: These data indicate that there is a need to increase awareness among health professionals and consumers regarding potential suboptimal intakes of choline in the United States, as well as the critical role that choline plays in health maintenance throughout the lifespan. Food scientists and the food and dietary supplement industries should consider working collectively with government agencies to discuss strategies to help offset the percentage of the population that does not meet the AI. Revision of the dietary reference intakes for choline should include replacement of the AI with an estimated average requirement and a recommended dietary allowance, so that more accurate population estimates of inadequate intakes may be calculated.},

The key structural feature enabling the interaction with light and other manifestations of electro-magnetism is the conjugated double-bond system that all members of this superfamily share in common. Among retinoids, retinaldehyde alone was long known as the active chromophore of vision in vertebrates and invertebrates, as well of various light-driven proton and ion pumps in Archaea. Until now, vitamin A (retinol) was solely regarded as a biochemical precursor for bioactive retinoids such as retinaldehyde and retinoic acid (RA), but recent results indicate that this compound has its own physiology. It functions as an electron carrier in mitochondria. By electronically coupling protein kinase Cδ (PCKδ) with cytochrome c, vitamin A enables the redox activation of this enzyme. This review focuses on the biochemistry and biology of the PCKδ signaling system, comprising PKCδ, the adapter protein p66Shc, cytochrome c and retinol. This complex positively regulates the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) by the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme. Vitamin A therefore plays a key role in glycolytic energy generation. The emerging paradigm of retinol as electron-transfer agent is potentially transformative, opening new frontiers in retinoid research.},

	abstract = {Leucine, a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), has been shown to stimulate muscle protein synthesis, and thus has been proposed to prevent age-related muscle atrophy (sarcopenia). Therefore, leucine supplementation may have potential benefits in elderly populations to preserve muscle mass. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) for leucine intake in young men has recently been determined to be 500 mg kg(-1) day(-1), and increases in blood ammonia concentrations were seen at intake levels above 500 mg kg(-1) day(-1); the UL for leucine in elderly is unknown. The objective of the current study was to determine the safety of leucine supplementation in healthy elderly men. Six healthy elderly men (72.2 ± 3.5 years) received graded stepwise increases in leucine intakes ranging from 50 to 750 mg kg(-1) day(-1), on eight separate study days. Plasma and urinary biochemical variables, including blood ammonia, and an oral primed-continuous protocol of L-1-(13)C-Leucine was performed. Blood ammonia concentrations above normal values (35 µmol/L) were observed at leucine intakes {\textgreater}550 mg kg(-1) day(-1). Leucine oxidation measured as a F(13)CO2 (rate of label tracer oxidation) increased with increasing leucine intakes and started to plateau after 450 mg kg(-1) day(-1). Two-phased linear regression analysis of the F(13)CO2 data revealed a breakpoint of 431 mg kg(-1) day(-1) (R (2) = 0.73), suggesting that the upper limit to oxidize leucine was reached at that point. Taking the data together the upper limit for leucine intake in healthy elderly could be set similar to young men at 500 mg kg(-1) day(-1) or {\textasciitilde}35 g/day for an individual weighing 70 kg.},

Concomitantly, motor functions, including the rate of movement and exploratory and voluntary motor activities, were significantly reduced in the aged mice compared to the young mice. In the motor cortex of the aged mouse brain, the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) phosphorylated at serine129 (Ser129) significantly increased, and the level of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) decreased compared with that in the young mouse brain. The administration of exogenous water-soluble CoQ10 to aged mice via drinking water restored the mitochondrial OCR, motor function, and phosphorylated α-syn and VGluT1 levels in the motor cortex.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine if ingestion of whole BS improves airway inflammatory and physiologic outcomes, and OS in adults with asthma and allergic sensitization to an indoor allergen.
METHODS: The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to compare the effects of BS with placebo (alfalfa sprouts [AS]) on airway inflammation and markers of OS. Forty adults (aged 18-50 years) were randomized to eat either (a) 100 g of BS daily or (b) 100 g of AS daily for 3 days. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), forced expiratory volume 1, nasal epithelial and PBMC gene expression, inflammatory and OS biomarkers, and symptoms were assessed both before and after ingestion of the sprouts. The primary outcome variable was the change in FENO. Secondary outcome measures included rhinitis and asthma symptoms, lung function, and OS and inflammatory biomarkers.
RESULTS: BS ingestion for 3 consecutive days did not reduce FENO, despite resulting in a marked increase in serum SFN concentrations (21 vs 22 parts per billion, PÂ = .76). Furthermore, BS consumption did not induce cytoprotective antioxidant genes in either PBMCs or nasal epithelial cells, reduce OS and inflammatory markers, or improve lung function.
CONCLUSIONS: Ingestion of whole BS for 3 days does not appear to improve eosinophilic pulmonary inflammation, inflammatory and OS biomarkers, or clinical features of asthma among atopic adults with asthma despite resulting in a marked increase in serum SFN levels.},

	abstract = {Macrophage autophagy has been shown to be protective against atherosclerosis. We previously discovered that ursolic acid (UA) promoted cancer cell autophagy. In the present study, we aimed to examine whether UA enhances macrophage autophagy in the context of atherogenesis. Cell culture study showed that UA enhanced autophagy of macrophages by increasing the expression of Atg5 and Atg16l1, which led to altered macrophage function. UA reduced pro-interleukin (IL)-1β protein levels and mature IL-1β secretion in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), without reducing IL-1β mRNA expression. Confocal microscopy showed that in LPS-treated macrophages, UA increased LC3 protein levels and LC3 appeared to colocalize with IL-1β. In cholesterol-loaded macrophages, UA increased cholesterol efflux to apoAI, although it did not alter mRNA or protein levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1. Electron microscopy showed that UA induced lipophagy in acetylated LDL-loaded macrophages, which may result in increased cholesterol ester hydrolysis in autophagolysosomes and presentation of free cholesterol to the cell membrane. In LDLR(-/-) mice fed a Western diet to induce atherogenesis, UA treatment significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesion size, accompanied by increased macrophage autophagy. In conclusion, the data suggest that UA promotes macrophage autophagy and, thereby, suppresses IL-1β secretion, promotes cholesterol efflux, and attenuates atherosclerosis in mice.},

	abstract = {Despite over 50 years of research, the field of sports nutrition continues to grow at a rapid rate. Whilst the traditional research focus was one that centred on strategies to maximise competition performance, emerging data in the last decade has demonstrated how both macronutrient and micronutrient availability can play a prominent role in regulating those cell signalling pathways that modulate skeletal muscle adaptations to endurance and resistance training. Nonetheless, in the context of exercise performance, it is clear that carbohydrate (but not fat) still remains king and that carefully chosen ergogenic aids (e.g. caffeine, creatine, sodium bicarbonate, beta-alanine, nitrates) can all promote performance in the correct exercise setting. In relation to exercise training, however, it is now thought that strategic periods of reduced carbohydrate and elevated dietary protein intake may enhance training adaptations whereas high carbohydrate availability and antioxidant supplementation may actually attenuate training adaptation. Emerging evidence also suggests that vitamin D may play a regulatory role in muscle regeneration and subsequent hypertrophy following damaging forms of exercise. Finally, novel compounds (albeit largely examined in rodent models) such as epicatechins, nicotinamide riboside, resveratrol, β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate, phosphatidic acid and ursolic acid may also promote or attenuate skeletal muscle adaptations to endurance and strength training. When taken together, it is clear that sports nutrition is very much at the heart of the Olympic motto, Citius, Altius, Fortius (faster, higher, stronger).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In contrast with some epidemiologic evidence, our previous research showed that a 4-wk diet that was high in low-fat dairy reduced insulin sensitivity compared with the effect of a diet that was high in red meat.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether a dairy meal would produce a greater insulin response than a carbohydrate-matched red meat meal would, which might account for the change in insulin sensitivity.
DESIGN: One meal contained lean red meat, bread, and orange juice, and the other meal contained skim milk, low-fat yogurt, cheese, and bread. Meals were isoenergetic, equal in macronutrient profile, and consumed 1 wk apart. Glucose, insulin, and triglycerides were measured before and 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after meal consumption. Differences between meals were tested with the use of a repeated-measures ANOVA and paired sample t tests.
RESULTS: Nineteen men and 24 women [mean ± SD age: 50.8 ± 16.0 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 30.0 ± 3.5] completed the study. Twenty-two participants had normal glucose tolerance, and 21 participants had impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. The red meat meal resulted in a higher glucose response at 30 min after consumption (P {\textless} 0.001); however, the glucose total AUC was not different between meals (P = NS). The mean ± SEM incremental AUC (iAUC) for glucose was significantly higher after the dairy meal than after the red meat meal (2.23 ± 0.49 compared with 0.88 ± 0.57 mmol/L · 3 h, respectively; P = 0.004). The insulin total AUC and iAUC were not different between meals (iAUC: 159.65 ± 20.0 mU/L · 3 h for red meat compared with 167.49 ± 24.1 mU/L · 3 h for dairy; P = NS).
CONCLUSIONS: Lean red meat and low-fat dairy produced a similar glycemic response. The higher glucose response 30 min after consumption of the red meat meal was likely attributable to differences in the glycemic load between orange juice and milk and yogurt. An insulinotropic effect of dairy was not observed. This trial was registered at www.anzctr.org.au as ACTRN12615000164594.},

Herein, the neuroprotection capacity of gartanin against glutamate-induced damage in HT22 cells and its possible mechanism(s) were investigated for the first time. Glutamate resulted in cell death in a dose-dependent manner and supplementation of 1-10 µM gartanin prevented the detrimental effects of glutamate on cell survival. Additional investigations on the underlying mechanisms suggested that gartanin could effectively reduce glutamate-induced intracellular ROS generation and mitochondrial depolarization. We further found that gartanin induced HO-1 expression independent of nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2). Subsequent studies revealed that the inhibitory effects of gartanin on glutamate-induced apoptosis were partially blocked by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of HO-1. Finally, the protein expression of phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream signal molecules, Sirtuin activator (SIRT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), increased after gartanin treatment. Taken together, these findings suggest gartanin is a potential neuroprotective agent against glutamate-induced oxidative injury partially through increasing Nrf-2-independed HO-1 and AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling pathways.},

Using a two-part approach in humans, the impact of theacrine (TeaCrine®, TC) was used to examine subjective dose-response, daily changes in cognitive and psychometric parameters, and changes in gas exchange and vital signs. All indicators were chosen to better ascertain the previously reported animal and human outcomes involving theacrine administration. Part 1 was a randomized, open-label, dose-response investigation in nine healthy participants whereby three participants ingested 400 mg TC per day and six participants ingested 200 mg/day. Participants recorded subjective changes in cognitive, psychometric, and exercise attributes using 150-mm anchored visual analog scale (VAS) before, and 1, 4, and 6 hours after ingestion every day for 7 consecutive days. Part 2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover investigation in 15 healthy subjects in which all participants ingested a single 200 mg dose of TC or Placebo (PLA). Anchored VAS questionnaires were used to detect subjective changes in various aspects of physical and mental energy along with changes in gas exchange and hemodynamic parameters before, and 1, 2, and 3 hours after acute ingestion. Energy, focus, and concentration increased from baseline values in both doses with no dose-response effect. VAS responses in the 200 mg for willingness to exercise, anxiety, motivation to train and libido increased across the measurement period while no such change was seen with the 400 mg dose. After consuming a single 200 mg dose, significant group × time interaction effects were seen for energy, fatigue, and concentration. No changes in resting heart rate, gas exchange, systemic hemodynamics or side effect profiles were noted.},

CURRENT KNOWLEDGE: Rubidium is a trace element strongly linked with depression, and is deficient in uremia sufferers. However, in uremic patients, rubidium deficiency is more evident during predialysis, as it is at least partially corrected during dialysis and after transplantation. It seems that diet restrictions might be the main cause of rubidium deficiency, as it is mainly found in red meat.
CONCLUSION: If rubidium is found in salami, then the occasional slice could be more beneficial for people suffering from depression than taking a lot of medication.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 136 men who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and had a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score ≥ 10 were selected. Among the participants, 33 received omega-3 fatty acid soft gel (1000 mg twice daily) with vitamin C (250 mg twice daily) (group 1), 31 took omega-3 fatty acid supplements and vitamin C placebo (group 2), 30 took omega-3 fatty acid supplement placebo and vitamin C (group 3), and 32 received omega-3 fatty acid supplement placebo and vitamin C placebo (group 4) for 2 months. Measured were serum MDA, TAC concentrations, and BDI scores at baseline and after 2 months.
RESULTS: This study showed that the BDI score was reduced significantly in all 4 groups, however, the level of decrease was more in the omega-3 fatty acid (alone) supplementation group (mean 6.29 score decrease) (p {\textless} 0.001). MDA level decreased significantly in groups with omega-3 fatty acids (mean 0.78 μmol/L ± 1.64 μmol/L decrease) (p = 0.014) or vitamin C supplementation alone (mean 0.74 μmol/L ± 1.55 μmol/L decrease) (p = 0.014), but not in combination.
CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids alone and not in combination with vitamin C had a better impact on depression and MDA level pronounced in depressed male shift workers.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coffee consumption is negatively associated with risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular mortality. Coffee roasting can greatly modify the quality-quantitative characteristics of bioactive compounds. We compared the effects of two different roasting intensities of the same naturally low-caffeine Arabica coffee variety (Laurina) on glucose and lipid metabolism as well as oxidative stress.
METHODS: We performed a double-blind, crossover intervention study. Fourteen healthy male volunteers consumed four cups daily of light roasted coffee (LRC) and dark roasted coffee (DRC), each for 1 wk (intervention period 1 and 2 respectively). One wk washout, with total abstinence from coffee and other possible caffeine sources, preceded each intervention. Data were collected at the end of washout and intervention periods.
RESULTS: Changes between washout and intervention periods in glucose concentrations at 2 h post-oral glucose tolerance test, were significantly lower after DRC than LRC intake (-0.6 ± 0.3 and 0.4 ± 0.3 mmol/L, P {\textless} 0.03). Changes in β-cell function, assessed as insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2, were significantly greater after DRC than LRC (34.7 ± 25.0 and -18.8 ± 21.0, P = 0.03). The initial (30 min) post-oral glucose tolerance test area under the curve of glucagon-like peptide-1 was 24± 9\% greater (P = 0.03) after DRC than LRC. LRC or DRC did not affect insulin sensitivity. Changes from basal of reduced-to-oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG) in erythrocytes were significantly greater after DRC than LRC (+1437 ± 371 and -152 ± 30, P {\textless} 0.05). The omega-3 index in erythrocyte membranes was 16± 4\% greater (P {\textless} 0.001) after DRC than LRC.
CONCLUSIONS: DRC consumption improved postload glucose metabolism by increasing incretin and insulin secretions. DRC compared to LRC improved redox balance and increased omega-3 fatty acids. Thus, we suggest greater metabolic benefits related to DRC.},

In this study, we assessed changes in the faecal microbiota induced by an animal-based diet and the effect of the ingestion of yoghurt supplemented with a probiotic strain on these changes. In total, 33 subjects were enrolled in an open, randomised, parallel-group study. After a seven-day pre-observation period, the subjects were allocated into three groups (11 subjects in each group). All of the subjects were provided with an animal-based diet for five days, followed by a balanced diet for 14 days. Subjects in the first group ingested dairy in the form of 200 g of yoghurt supplemented with Bifidobacterium longum during both the animal-based and balanced diet periods (YAB group). Subjects in the second group ingested yoghurt only during the balanced diet period (YB group). Subjects who did not ingest yoghurt throughout the intervention were used as the control (CTR) group. Faecal samples were collected before and after the animal-based diet was provided and after the balanced diet was provided, followed by analysis by high-throughput sequencing of amplicons derived from the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. In the YB and CTR groups, the animal-based diet caused a significant increase in the relative abundance of Bilophila, Odoribacter, Dorea and Ruminococcus (belonging to Lachnospiraceae) and a significant decrease in the level of Bifidobacterium after five days of intake. With the exception of Ruminococcus, these changes were not observed in the YAB group. No significant effect was induced by yoghurt supplementation following an animal-based diet (YB group vs CTR group). These results suggest that the intake of yoghurt supplemented with bifidobacteria played a role in maintaining a normal microbiota composition during the ingestion of a meat-based diet.

In addition, the decrease in SBP in the two case groups was statistically significant relative to the placebo group (P {\textless} 0.05-0.01). Meanwhile, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values in the case groups were found to be significantly reduced from the baseline and a significant reduction was also observed in these groups (P {\textless} 0.01) when compared with the placebo group. In addition, extract administration reduced both SBP and DBP in a dose-dependent manner.

Acute and chronic toxicity studies have recently confirmed the safety of N. sativa oil and its most abundant active component, thymoquinone, particularly when given orally. The present work is aimed at summarizing the extremely valuable work done by various investigators on the effects of N. sativa seed, its extracts and active principles against cancer. Those related to the underlying mechanism of action, derivatives of thymoquinone, nano thymoquinone and combinations of thymoquinone with the currently used cytotoxic drugs are of particular interest.

The seeds of N. sativa have been widely used in the treatment of different diseases and ailments. In Islamic literature, it is considered as one of the greatest forms of healing medicine. It has been recommended for using on regular basis in Tibb-e-Nabwi (Prophetic Medicine). It has been widely used as antihypertensive, liver tonics, diuretics, digestive, anti-diarrheal, appetite stimulant, analgesics, anti-bacterial and in skin disorders. Extensive studies on N. sativa have been carried out by various researchers and a wide spectrum of its pharmacological actions have been explored which may include antidiabetic, anticancer, immunomodulator, analgesic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic, bronchodilator, hepato-protective, renal protective, gastro-protective, antioxidant properties, etc. Due to its miraculous power of healing, N. sativa has got the place among the top ranked evidence based herbal medicines. This is also revealed that most of the therapeutic properties of this plant are due to the presence of thymoquinone which is major bioactive component of the essential oil.

	doi = {10.1186/s12876-015-0321-3},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coffee consumption has been associated with reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) however, the mechanism for this association has yet to be elucidated. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) characterizes and predicts T2DM yet the relationship of coffee with this disorder remains unclear. Our aim was to investigate the associations of coffee with markers of liver injury in 1005 multi-ethnic, non-diabetic adults in the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study.
METHODS: Dietary intake was assessed using a validated 114-item food frequency questionnaire. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and fetuin-A were determined in fasting blood samples and the validated NAFLD liver fat score was calculated. Multivariate linear regression assessed the contribution of coffee to variation in markers of liver injury.
RESULTS: Caffeinated coffee showed significant inverse associations with ALT (β = -0.08, p = 0.0111), AST (β = -0.05, p = 0.0155) and NAFLD liver fat score (β = -0.05, p = 0.0293) but not with fetuin-A (β = 0.04, p = 0.17). When the highest alcohol consumers were excluded, these associations remained (ALT β = -0.11, p = 0.0037; AST β = -0.05, p = 0.0330; NAFLD liver fat score β = -0.06, p = 0.0298). With additional adjustment for insulin sensitivity, the relationship with ALT remained significant (ALT β = -0.08, p = 0.0400; AST β = -0.03, p = 0.20; NAFLD liver fat score β = -0.03, p = 0.27). There were no significant associations of decaffeinated coffee with liver markers.
CONCLUSIONS: These analyses indicate a beneficial impact of caffeinated coffee on liver morphology and/or function, and suggest that this relationship may mediate the well-established inverse association of coffee with risk of T2DM.},

However, it is unknown whether supplemental menaquinone (MK)-4 can reduce CAC or arterial stiffness. To study the effect of MK-4 supplementation on CAC and brachial ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV).
METHODS: This study is a single arm design to take 45 mg/day MK-4 daily as a therapeutic drug for 1 year. Primary endpoint was CAC score determined using 64-slice multislice CT (Siemens), and the secondary endpoint was baPWV measured before and 1 year after MK-4 therapy.
RESULTS: A total of 26 patients were enrolled. The average age was 69 ± 8 years and 65 \% were female. Plasma levels of phylloquinone (PK), MK-7, and MK4 were 1.94 ± 1.38 ng/ml, 14.2 ± 11.9 ng/ml and 0.4 ± 2.0 ng/ml, respectively, suggesting that MK-7 was the dominant vitamin K in the studied population. Baseline CAC and baPWV were 513 ± 773 and 1834 ± 289 cm/s, respectively. At 1 year following MK-4 supplementation, the values were 588 ± 872 (+14 \%) and 1821 ± 378 cm/s (-0.7 \%), respectively. In patients with high PIVKA-2, -18 \% annual reduction of baPWV was observed.
CONCLUSION: Despite high dose MK-4 supplementation, CAC increased +14 \% annually, but baPWV did not change (-0.7 \%). The benefits of MK-4 supplementation were only observed in patients with vitamin K insufficiencies correlated with high PIVKA-2 baseline levels, reducing baPWV but not CAC.

In the last few years, different natural plants and their active constituents have been used in neurological therapy. The availability, lower price, and less toxic effects of herbal medicines compared with synthetic agents make them as simple and excellent choice in the treatment of nervous diseases. Nigella sativa, which belongs to the botanical family of Ranunculaceae, is a widely used medicinal plant all over the world. In traditional and modern medicines several beneficial properties have been attributed to N. sativa and its main component, thymoquinone (TQ). In this review, various studies in scientific databases regarding the neuropharmacological aspects of N. sativa and TQ have been introduced. Results of these studies showed that N. sativa and TQ have several properties including anticonvulsant, antidepressant, anxiolytic, anti-ischemic, analgesic, antipsychotic, and memory enhancer. Furthermore, its protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson and multiple sclerosis have been discussed. Although there are many studies indicating the beneficial actions of this plant in nervous system, the number of research projects relating to the human reports is rare.

	abstract = {Rubidium has been used to treat psychiatric conditions including depression. We examined the antidepressant activity of rubidium chloride (RbCl) in male mice and the possible interference of nitric oxide (NO) in this effect. Mouse forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) were used to evaluate the antidepressant-like effect of RbCl. These drugs were used in this study: N(G)-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), a non-selective nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, 7-Nitroindazole and aminoguanidine, selective neuronal and inducible NOS inhibitors, respectively, and l-arginine, an NO precursor. We studied the changes of serum and hippocampus nitrite level after different treatments. RbCl (30mg/kg), when administered 60min before the tests, significantly reduced the immobility time. Non-effective doses of l-NAME (10mg/kg) and aminoguanidine (50mg/kg), co-administered with the effective dose of RbCl (30mg/kg), reversed the anti-immobility effect of RbCl, while 7-NI (25mg/kg) could not prevent the diminishing effect of RbCl on immobility time. Moreover, co-administration of non-effective doses of l-arginine (750mg/kg) and RbCl (10mg/kg) decreased the immobility time. None of the mentioned treatments altered the locomotor activity of mice in open-field test. Nitrite level was significantly increased in serum and hippocampus of animals after RbCl (30mg/kg) administration and this nitrite level elevation was reversed by non-effective dose of l-NAME and aminoguanidine, but not 7-NI. Our data for the first time reveal the role of NO pathway in the antidepressant-like activity of RbCl, concluding that this effect results from elevation of NO through involvement of iNOS in mice.},

Slight adverse effects were also observed (diarrhea and skin rashes). Rubidium chloride showed a marked and rapid anti-depressive action which was particularly evident in relation to mood, anti-conservative ideas, work, occupational interests and psychomotory slowing-down. It is clear that these symptoms represent the most important aspects of the polymorphous depressive syndrome and, in some ways, this improvement should be interpreted as the effective influence of the drug on the biological contest of mood changes.},

Herein, we found that mogroside V possesses tumor growth inhibitory activity in in vitro and in vivo models of pancreatic cancer by promoting apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1 cells), which may in part be mediated through regulating the STAT3 signaling pathway. These results were confirmed in vivo in a mouse xenograft model of pancreatic cancer. In xenograft tumors, Ki-67 and PCNA, the most commonly used markers of tumor cell proliferation, were downregulated after intravenous administration of mogroside V. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assays showed that mogroside V treatment promoted apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells in the xenograft tumors. Furthermore, we found that mogroside V treatment significantly reduced the expression of CD31-labeled blood vessels and of the pro-angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor in the xenografts, indicating that mogroside V might limit the growth of pancreatic tumors by inhibiting angiogenesis and reducing vascular density. These results therefore demonstrate that the natural, sweet-tasting compound mogroside V can inhibit proliferation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells via targeting multiple biological targets.},

We previously demonstrated 5 days of creatine (Cr) and carbohydrate (CHO) ingestion augmented post-exercise muscle glycogen storage compared to CHO feeding alone in healthy volunteers. Here, we aimed to characterise the time-course of this Cr-induced response under more stringent and controlled experimental conditions and identify potential mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon. Fourteen healthy, male volunteers cycled to exhaustion at 70 \% VO2peak. Muscle biopsies were obtained at rest immediately post-exercise and after 1, 3 and 6 days of recovery, during which Cr or placebo supplements (20 g day(-1)) were ingested along with a prescribed high CHO diet (37.5 kcal kg body mass(-1) day(-1), {\textgreater}80 \% calories CHO). Oral-glucose tolerance tests (oral-GTT) were performed pre-exercise and after 1, 3 and 6 days of Cr and placebo supplementation. Exercise depleted muscle glycogen content to the same extent in both treatment groups. Creatine supplementation increased muscle total-Cr, free-Cr and phosphocreatine (PCr) content above placebo following 1, 3 and 6 days of supplementation (all P {\textless} 0.05). Creatine supplementation also increased muscle glycogen content noticeably above placebo after 1 day of supplementation (P {\textless} 0.05), which was sustained thereafter. This study confirmed dietary Cr augments post-exercise muscle glycogen super-compensation, and demonstrates this occurred during the initial 24 h of post-exercise recovery (when muscle total-Cr had increased by {\textless}10 \%). This marked response ensued without apparent treatment differences in muscle insulin sensitivity (oral-GTT, muscle GLUT4 mRNA), osmotic stress (muscle c-fos and HSP72 mRNA) or muscle cell volume (muscle water content) responses, such that another mechanism must be causative.},

We hypothesized that enriching a protein drink with leucine would improve anabolic responses to resistance exercise (RE: 6 × 8 knee-extension repetitions at 75\% of 1-RM) in both young and older adults. Groups (n = 9) of young (24 ± 6 y, BMI 23 ± 2 kg m-2) and older men (70 ± 5 y, BMI 25 ± 2 kg m-2) were randomized to either: (i) RE followed by Slim-Fast Optima (SFO 10 g PRO; 24 g CHO) with 4.2 g of leucine (LEU) or, (ii) RE + SFO with 4.2 g of alanine (ALA; isonitrogenous control). Muscle biopsies were taken before, immediately after, and 1, 2 and 4 h after RE and feeding. Muscle protein synthesis (MPS) was measured by incorporation of [1, 2-13C2] leucine into myofibrillar proteins and the phosphorylation of p70S6K1 by immunoblotting. In young men, both area under the curve (AUC; FSR 0-4 h P {\textless} 0.05) and peak FSR (0.11 vs. 0.08\%.h.-1; P {\textless} 0.05) were greater in the SFO + LEU than in the SFO + ALA group, after RE. Similarly, in older men, AUC analysis revealed that post-exercise anabolic responses were greater in the SFO + LEU than SFO + ALA group, after RE (AUC; FSR 0-4 h P {\textless} 0.05). Irrespective of age, increases in p70S6K1 phosphorylation were evident in response to both SFO + LEU and SFO + ALA, although greater with leucine supplementation than alanine (fold-change 2.2 vs. 3.2; P {\textless} 0.05), specifically in the older men.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate immunotoxic effect of safranal (SAF), a main component of Crocus sativus essential oil, using Balb/c mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SAF was administered intraperitoneally at doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 1 ml/kg for 3 weeks. Hystopathological examination of spleen and bone marrow, cellularity of spleen, delayed type of hypersensitivity (DTH) response, hemagglutination titer (HA), cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation assay were studied in various groups of animals.
RESULTS: Spleen cellularity for SAF groups (0.1 ml/kg SAF: 6.68 [± 0.88] × 10(7), 0.5 ml/kg SAF: 8.16 [± 1.33] × 10(7), 1 ml/kg SAF: 6.12 [± 0.59] × 10(7)) did not significantly differ as compared to vehicle control (8.52 [± 1.36] × 10(7); p {\textgreater} 0.05). In addition, SAF at all doses could not produce any signiﬁcant changes in hematological parameters, HA titer, DTH and lymphoproliferation responses, as well as in release of cytokines by isolated splenocytes (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Despite a few studies demonstrating some immunomodulatory effects for saffron extract, SAF as a major constituent of saffron did not induce any marked effects in immune system parameters of mice.
CONCLUSION: Contrary to the toxicological studies which have indicated that SAF is more toxic than other active constituents in saffron stigma, at least it was found to be safe to mice immune system and has no toxicity on humoral and cellular immune responses.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) involves a series of pathological changes including the inflammation and increased cytokine levels. Fisetin, a natural flavonoid, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, and also has been shown in our previous studies to exert anti-depressant-like properties. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of fisetin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive-like behavior and inflammation in mice. The results suggested that the immobility time in the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) were increased at 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after LPS injection (0.83 mg/kg). However, only the group of 24 h treatment did not show any effect on locomotion counts. Pretreatment with fisetin at doses of 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg (p.o.) for 7 days reversed LPS-induced alterations of the immobility time in both of these two tests. Further neurochemical assays suggested that pretreatment with fisetin reversed LPS-induced overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Moreover, higher dose of fisetin effectively antagonized iNOS mRNA expression and nitrite levels via the modulation of NF-κB in the hippocampus and PFC. Taken together, fisetin may be an effective therapeutic agent for LPS-induced depressive-like behaviors, which is due to its anti-inflammatory property.},

	abstract = {SCOPE: We previously showed that apiaceous but not cruciferous vegetables reduced DNA adducts formed by 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4, 5-b]pyridine (PhIP) in rats. Here, we report the effects of the putative chemopreventive phytochemicals from these vegetables on PhIP metabolism and DNA adduct formation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Rats received three supplemented diets: P + I (phenethyl isothiocyanate and indole-3-carbinol), furanocoumarins (FC, 5-methoxypsoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen, and isopimpinellin), and combination (P + I and FC). Phytochemical supplementation matched the levels in vegetables fed in our previous study. After 6 days, rats were injected with PhIP (10 mg/kg body wt) and killed after 24-h urine collection. Compared to the control, P + I increased activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 (10.1-fold), CYP1A2 (3.62-fold), and sulfotransferase 1A1 (2.70-fold). The combination diet also increased CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 activity. Urinary metabolomics revealed that PhIP metabolite profiles generally agreed with biotransformation enzyme activities. P + I and combination diets reduced PhIP-DNA adducts by 43.5 and 24.1\%, respectively, whereas FC had no effect on adducts, compared to the control diet.
CONCLUSION: Effects of phytochemicals on metabolic outcomes and markers of carcinogenesis might differ from fresh vegetables, thus limiting the inferences that one can draw from the effects of purified phytochemicals on the health benefits of the vegetables from which they derive.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common brain disorder worldwide. Aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation play critical roles in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles highly associated with neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment in AD pathogenesis. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) is a key kinase responsible for tau hyperphosphorylation. Selective inhibition of GSK3β is a promising strategy in AD therapy. Corn silks (CS, Zea mays L.) have been traditionally used as a medicinal herb and recently noted for their potentially cognitive benefits. However, the neuroprotective components of CS and their molecular mechanism have received little attention to date. As part of our effort screening phytochemicals against a broad panel of kinases targeting AD tauopathy, we found inhibition of GSK3β by CS extracts. Subsequent bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation and identification of two 6-C-glycosylflavones, isoorientin (1) and 3'-methoxymaysin (2), with selective inhibition against GSK3β in vitro. Enzyme kinetics and molecular docking studies demonstrated that 1 specifically inhibited GSK3β via an ATP noncompetitive mechanism, acting as a substrate competitive inhibitor of GSK3β. Further in vitro cellular studies demonstrated that 1 effectively attenuated tau phosphorylation mediated by GSK3β and was neuroprotective against β-amyloid-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. The C-glycosylflavones represent new lead candidates with a novel mechanism of action for the development of AD phytopharmaceuticals.},

	abstract = {Broccoli sprouts are widely consumed in many parts of the world. There have been no reported concerns with respect to their tolerance and safety in humans. A formal phase I study of safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics appeared justified because these sprouts are being used as vehicles for the delivery of the glucosinolate glucoraphanin and its cognate isothiocyanate sulforaphane [1-isothiocyanato-(4R)-(methylsulfinyl)butane] in clinical trials. Such trials have been designed to evaluate protective efficacy against development of neoplastic and other diseases. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical study of sprout extracts containing either glucosinolates (principally glucoraphanin, the precursor of sulforaphane) or isothiocyanates (principally sulforaphane) was conducted on healthy volunteers who were in-patients on our clinical research unit. The subjects were studied in three cohorts, each comprising three treated individuals and one placebo recipient. Following a 5-day acclimatization period on a crucifer-free diet, the broccoli sprout extracts were administered orally at 8-h intervals for 7 days (21 doses), and the subjects were monitored during this period and for 3 days after the last treatment. Doses were 25 micromol of glucosinolate (cohort A), 100 micromol of glucosinolate (cohort B), or 25 micromol of isothiocyanate (cohort C). The mean cumulative excretion of dithiocarbamates as a fraction of dose was very similar in cohorts A and B (17.8 +/- 8.6\% and 19.6 +/- 11.7\% of dose, respectively) and very much higher and more consistent in cohort C (70.6 +/- 2.0\% of dose). Thirty-two types of hematology or chemistry tests were done before, during, and after the treatment period. Indicators of liver (transaminases) and thyroid [thyroid-stimulating hormone, total triiodothyronine (T3), and free thyroxine (T4)] function were examined in detail. No significant or consistent subjective or objective abnormal events (toxicities) associated with any of the sprout extract ingestions were observed.},

Whether hydroxytyrosol alters enzymatic or spontaneous oxidation of dopamine has been unknown. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were incubated with hydroxytyrosol (10 µM, 180 min) alone or with the MAO-A inhibitor clorgyline (1 nM) or the MAO-B inhibitors rasagiline or selegiline (0.5 µM). Hydroxytyrosol decreased levels of DOPAL by 30 \% and Cys-DA by 49 \% (p {\textless} 0.0001 each). Co-incubation with hydroxytyrosol prevented the increases in Cys-DA seen with all 3 MAO inhibitors. Hydroxytyrosol therefore inhibits both enzymatic and spontaneous oxidation of endogenous dopamine and mitigates the increase in spontaneous oxidation during MAO inhibition.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Controversy surrounds the effect of alcohol consumption on the development of dementia and cognitive impairment. We investigated the association between consumption of different alcoholic beverages and β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation in the brain, 1 of the neuropathological lesions of Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: In total, 125 males of the Helsinki Sudden Death autopsy Series were included with an age range at death 35 to 70 years. The consumption of alcohol, Aβ aggregation in the brain, and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype were assessed. Relatives answered a questionnaire to gather alcohol consumption history, and Aβ was visualized by implementing immunohistochemical staining of brain sections. Aβ immunoreactivity (IR) was assessed in a dichotomized (yes/no) fashion and as a stained area fraction (\%). APOE genotype was assessed in DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded cardiac muscle samples.
RESULTS: Increased age (p = 0.001; odds ratio [OR] = 1.09, confidence interval [CI] = 1.04 to 1.15) was associated with higher prevalence of Aβ-IR. Beer drinking decreased (p = 0.024; OR = 0.35, CI = 0.14 to 0.87) the prevalence of Aβ-IR and was associated with a significantly lower extent of Aβ-IR (p = 0.022). The amount of alcohol consumed was not linked with Aβ aggregation and neither was spirit nor wine consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: Beer consumption may protect against Aβ aggregation in brain. Further studies are necessary to fully understand the effects of alcohol on Aβ pathology seen in brain tissue.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Strenuous, high-volume exercise is often associated with inflammation and joint pain. Cissus quadrangularis (CQ) has been reported to have anti-inflammatory activity. The purpose of our study was to determine the therapeutic effects of CQ supplementation in healthy, exercise-trained men with joint-specific pain.
METHODS: Twenty-nine men between the ages of 20 and 46 years, who reportedly experienced chronic joint pain as a result of strenuous exercise, participated in our pilot study. All men received CQ 3200 mg daily for 8 weeks. Before and after the 8-week intervention period, subjects completed a questionnaire to determine their degree of joint pain (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index of Osteoarthritis [WOMAC]). Clinical measures (eg, heart rate, blood pressure, blood biomarkers) were also collected for each subject pre- (baseline) and post-intervention.
RESULTS: Subject ratings for multiple variables within the WOMAC Index improved (decreased) significantly (P {\textless} 0.05), with the subject mean total WOMAC score decreasing from 25.4 ± 2.4 to 17.4 ± 2.1 ({\textasciitilde}31\%), pre- to post-intervention. No clinical measure was significantly impacted by use of CQ supplementation.
CONCLUSION: An 8-week course of supplementation with CQ reduced joint pain in a sample of 29 young, otherwise healthy, exercise-trained men. Additional study is needed to extend these findings, including comparison with a placebo-controlled cohort, and possibly, examining effects of CQ use in women and older adult subjects.},

Examples of non-stimulatory thermogenic agents include p-synephrine (bitter orange extract), capsaicin, forskolin (Coleus root extract), and chlorogenic acid (green coffee bean extract). Green tea is an example of a thermogenic with the potential to produce mild but clinically insignificant undesirable stimulatory effects. The use of the aforementioned thermogenic agents in combination with other extracts such as those derived from Salacia reticulata, Sesamum indicum, Lagerstroemia speciosa, Cissus quadrangularis, and Moringa olifera, as well as the use of the carotenoids as lutein and fucoxanthin, and flavonoids as naringin and hesperidin can further facilitate energy metabolism and weight management as well as sports performance without adverse side effects.

Animal and in vitro studies provide support for the use of Cissus in promoting bone fracture healing and as an anti-osteoporotic. Several human studies support the use of Cissus extracts in weight management. No studies have been conducted demonstrating that Cissus exhibits anabolic and body building activities. Based on studies to date, Cissus extracts appear to be exceedingly safe and free of adverse effects at the doses commonly used. A wide variety of chemical constituents have been isolated and identified from Cissus extracts, including steroids, flavonoids, stilbenes, iridoids, triterpenes and gallic acid derivatives. However, in few cases have specific physiological effects been related to identifiable constituents. Better standardization of extracts and more well-controlled human studies are required.},

OBJECTIVE: The study was carried out to investigate the anti-arthritic activity of C. quadrangularis hydroalcoholic extract (CQHE) and to explore the plausible mechanism of action.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Arthritis was induced by sub plantar administration of formaldehyde (2\% v/v) and 0.1ml of complete Freund's adjuvant. Joint swelling was measured on days 8, 9 and 10 in formaldehyde-induced arthritis and on 3, 7, 14 and 21 days in adjuvant induced arthritis (AIA) respectively. Serum and ankle joints of AIA rats were used for estimation of serum TNF-α level, oxidative stress markers and synovial expression of proinflammatory cytokines/cytokine receptor (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-R1), angiogenesis marker (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-3\& 9). An acute and 28-day oral toxicity was carried out to evaluate the safety of the test drug.
RESULTS: CQHE produced a dose dependent inhibition of joint swelling in both formaldehyde-induced and adjuvant induced arthritis. CQHE treatment also reduced serum TNF-α level, oxidative stress and synovial expression of inflammatory and angiogenesis marker. In sub acute toxicity study of CQHE, chronic administration of CQHE did not produce any physiological and pathological changes as compared to normal rats.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the anti-arthritic potential of C. quadrangularis and it validates its traditional use for the treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory disorders.},

	abstract = {Extended periods of skeletal muscle disuse results in muscle atrophy and weakness. Currently, no therapeutic treatment is available for the prevention of this problem. Nonetheless, growing evidence suggests that prevention of disuse-induced oxidative stress in inactive muscle fibers can delay inactivity-induced muscle wasting. Therefore, this study tested the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with the antioxidant astaxanthin would protect against disuse muscle atrophy, in part, by prevention of myonuclear apoptosis. Wistar rats (8 weeks old) were divided into control (CT, n = 9), hindlimb unloading (HU, n = 9), and hindlimb unloading with astaxanthin (HU + AX, n = 9) groups. Following 2 weeks of dietary supplementation, rats in the HU and HU + AX groups were exposed to unloading for 7 days. Seven-day unloading resulted in reduced soleus muscle weight and myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) by {\textasciitilde}30 and {\textasciitilde}47 \%, respectively. Nonetheless, relative muscle weights and CSA of the soleus muscle in the HU + AX group were significantly greater than those of the HU group. Moreover, astaxanthin prevented disuse-induced increase in the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive nuclei. We conclude that astaxanthin supplementation prior to and during hindlimb unloading attenuates soleus muscle atrophy, in part, by suppressing myonuclear apoptosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Muscle wasting prevails in numerous diseases (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney diseases, COPD,…) and increases healthcare costs. A major clinical issue is to devise new strategies preventing muscle wasting. We hypothesized that 8-week docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation prior to fasting may preserve muscle mass in vivo.
METHODS: Six-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a DHA-enriched or a control diet for 8 weeks and then fasted for 48 h.
RESULTS: Feeding mice a DHA-enriched diet prior to fasting elevated muscle glycogen contents, reduced muscle wasting, blocked the 55\% decrease in Akt phosphorylation, and reduced by 30-40\% the activation of AMPK, ubiquitination, or autophagy. The DHA-enriched diet fully abolished the fasting induced-messenger RNA (mRNA) over-expression of the endocannabinoid receptor-1. Finally, DHA prevented or modulated the fasting-dependent increase in muscle mRNA levels for Rab18, PLD1, and perilipins, which determine the formation and fate of lipid droplets, in parallel with muscle sparing.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that 8-week DHA supplementation increased energy stores that can be efficiently mobilized, and thus preserved muscle mass in response to fasting through the regulation of Akt- and AMPK-dependent signalling pathways for reducing proteolysis activation. Whether a nutritional strategy aiming at increasing energy status may shorten recovery periods in clinical settings remains to be tested.},

	abstract = {Geriatrics is a medical practice that addresses the complex needs of older patients and emphasizes maintaining functional independence even in the presence of chronic disease. Treatment of geriatric patients requires a different strategy and is very complex. Geriatric medicines aim to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults. Development of effective dietary interventions for promoting healthy aging is an active but challenging area of research because aging is associated with an increased risk of chronic disease, disability, and death. Aging populations are a global phenomenon. The most widespread conditions affecting older people are hypertension, congestive heart failure, dementia, osteoporosis, breathing problems, cataract, and diabetes to name a few. Decreased immunity is also partially responsible for the increased morbidity and mortality resulting from infectious agents in the elderly. Nutritional status is one of the chief variables that explains differences in both the incidence and pathology of infection. Elderly people are at increased risk for micronutrient deficiencies due to a variety of factors including social, physical, economic, and emotional obstacles to eating. Thus there is an urgent need to shift priorities to increase our attention on ways to prevent chronic illnesses associated with aging. Individually, people must put increased efforts into establishing healthy lifestyle practices, including consuming a more healthful diet. The present review thus focuses on the phytochemicals of nutraceutical importance for the geriatric population.},

Collagen, a major component of joint cartilage, is found in the diet, particularly in meat. Its hydrolysed form, collagen hydrolysate (CH), is well absorbed. CH may stimulate the joint matrix cells to synthesize collagen, so helping to maintain the structure of the joint and potentially to aid joint comfort.
METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, controlled multicentre trial, 250 subjects with primary osteoarthritis of the knee were given 10 g CH daily for 6 months.
RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in knee joint comfort as assessed by visual analogue scales to assess pain and the Womac pain subscale. Subjects with the greatest joint deterioration, and with least intake of meat protein in their habitual diets, benefited most.
CONCLUSION: CH is safe and effective and warrants further consideration as a food ingredient.},

	doi = {10.1185/030079908X291967},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Collagen hydrolysate is a nutritional supplement that has been shown to exert an anabolic effect on cartilage tissue. Its administration appears beneficial in patients with osteoarthritis.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of collagen hydrolysate on activity-related joint pain in athletes who are physically active and have no evidence of joint disease.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted at Penn State University in University Park, Pennsylvania. Parameters including joint pain, mobility, and inflammation were evaluated with the use of a visual analogue scale during a 24-week study phase.
STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Between September 2005 and June 2006, 147 subjects who competed on a varsity team or a club sport were recruited. Data from 97 of 147 subjects could be statistically evaluated.
INTERVENTION: One hundred and forty-seven subjects (72 male, 75 female) were randomly assigned to two groups: a group (n = 73) receiving 25 mL of a liquid formulation that contained 10 g of collagen hydrolysate (CH-Alpha) and a group (n = 74) receiving a placebo, which consisted of 25 mL of liquid that contained xanthan.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy parameter was the change in the visual analogue scales from baseline during the study phase in relation to the parameters referring to pain, mobility, and inflammation.
RESULTS: When data from all subjects (n = 97) were evaluated, six parameters showed statistically significant changes with the dietary supplement collagen hydrolysate (CH) compared with placebo: joint pain at rest, assessed by the physician (CH vs. placebo (-1.37 +/- 1.78 vs. -0.90 +/- 1.74 (p = 0.025)) and five parameters assessed by study participants: joint pain when walking (-1.11 +/- 1.98 vs. -0.46 +/- 1.63, p = 0.007), joint pain when standing (-0.97 +/- 1.92 vs. -0.43 +/- 1.74, p = 0.011), joint pain at rest (-0.81 +/- 1.77 vs. -0.39 +/- 1.56, p = 0.039), joint pain when carrying objects (-1.45 +/- 2.11 vs. -0.83 +/- 1.71, p = 0.014) and joint pain when lifting (-1.79 +/- 2.11 vs. -1.26 +/- 2.09, p = 0.018). When a subgroup analysis of subjects with knee arthralgia (n = 63) was performed, the difference between the effect of collagen hydrolysate vs. placebo was more pronounced. The parameter joint pain at rest, assessed by the physician, had a statistical significance level of p = 0.001 (-1.67 +/- 1.89 vs. -0.86 +/- 1.77), while the other five parameters based on the participants' assessments were also statistically significant: joint pain when walking (p = 0.003 (-1.38 +/- 2.12 vs. -0.54 +/- 1.65)), joint pain when standing (p = 0.015 (-1.17 +/- 2.06 vs. -0.50 +/- 1.68)), joint pain at rest with (p = 0.021 (-1.01 +/-1.92 vs. -0.47 +/- 1.63)), joint pain when running a straight line (p = 0.027 (-1.50 +/- 1.97 vs. -0.80 +/- 1.66)) and joint pain when changing direction (p = 0.026 (-1.87 +/- 2.18 vs. -1.20 +/- 2.10)).
CONCLUSION: This was the first clinical trial of 24-weeks duration to show improvement of joint pain in athletes who were treated with the dietary supplement collagen hydrolysate. The results of this study have implications for the use of collagen hydrolysate to support joint health and possibly reduce the risk of joint deterioration in a high-risk group. Despite the study's size and limitations, the results suggest that athletes consuming collagen hydrolysate can reduce parameters (such as pain) that have a negative impact on athletic performance. Future studies are needed to support these findings.},

This study was undertaken to determine whether ALS-L1023 (ALS) prepared by a two-step organic solvent fractionation from Melissa leaves, which exhibits antiangiogenic activity, can regulate adipose tissue growth. The effects of ALS on angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling were measured using in vitro assays. The effects of ALS on adipose tissue growth were investigated in high fat diet-induced obese mice. ALS inhibited VEGF- and bFGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation and suppressed matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in vitro. Compared to obese control mice, administration of ALS to obese mice reduced body weight gain, adipose tissue mass and adipocyte size without affecting appetite. ALS treatment decreased blood vessel density and MMP activity in adipose tissues. ALS reduced the mRNA levels of angiogenic factors (VEGF-A and FGF-2) and MMPs (MMP-2 and MMP-9), whereas ALS increased the mRNA levels of angiogenic inhibitors (TSP-1, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2) in adipose tissues. The protein levels of VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were also decreased by ALS in adipose tissue. Metabolic changes in plasma lipids, liver triglycerides, and hepatic expression of fatty acid oxidation genes occurred during ALS-induced weight loss. These results suggest that ALS, which has antiangiogenic and MMP inhibitory activities, reduces adipose tissue mass in nutritionally obese mice, demonstrating that adipose tissue growth can be regulated by angiogenesis inhibitors.},

Often a behavioral reaction to a visual stimulus must be faster than the conscious perception of that stimulus, as is the case with many sports (e.g., baseball). Visual psychophysics provides a relatively simple and precise means of measuring visual processing speed called the temporal contrast sensitivity function (tCSF). Past study has shown that macular pigment (a collection of xanthophylls, lutein (L), meso-zeaxanthin (MZ) and zeaxanthin (Z), found in the retina) optical density (MPOD) is positively correlated with the tCSF. In this study, we found similar correlations when testing 102 young healthy subjects. As a follow-up, we randomized 69 subjects to receive a placebo (n=15) or one of two L and Z supplements (n=54). MPOD and tCSF were measured psychophysically at baseline and 4months. Neither MPOD nor tCSF changed for the placebo condition, but both improved significantly as a result of supplementation. These results show that an intervention with L and Z can increase processing speed even in young healthy subjects.},

The goal of this study was to analyse various fruits and vegetables to establish which ones contain lutein and/or zeaxanthin and can serve as possible dietary supplements for these carotenoids.
METHODS: Homogenates of 33 fruits and vegetables, two fruit juices, and egg yolk were used for extraction of the carotenoids with hexane. Measurement of the different carotenoids and their isomers was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography using a single column with an isocratic run, and a diode array detector.
RESULTS: Egg yolk and maize (corn) contained the highest mole percentage (\% of total) of lutein and zeaxanthin (more than 85\% of the total carotenoids). Maize was the vegetable with the highest quantity of lutein (60\% of total) and orange pepper was the vegetable with the highest amount of zeaxanthin (37\% of total). Substantial amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin (30-50\%) were also present in kiwi fruit, grapes, spinach, orange juice, zucchini (or vegetable marrow), and different kinds of squash. The results show that there are fruits and vegetables of various colours with a relatively high content of lutein and zeaxanthin.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the dark green leafy vegetables, previously recommended for a higher intake of lutein and zeaxanthin, have 15-47\% of lutein, but a very low content (0-3\%) of zeaxanthin. Our study shows that fruits and vegetables of various colours can be consumed to increase dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin.},

	abstract = {Adults with metabolic syndrome from different race/ethnicities are often predisposed to developing type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, growing evidence suggests that healthy diets and lifestyle choices can significantly slow or prevent progression to T2D. This poorly understood relationship to healthy dietary patterns and prevention of T2D motivated us to conduct a retrospective analysis to determine the potential impact of a minor dietary lifestyle change (daily mushroom consumption) on known T2D risk factors in racially diverse adults with confirmed features of the metabolic syndrome. Retrospectively, we studied 37 subjects who had participated in a dietary intervention focused on vitamin D bioavailability from white button mushrooms (WBM). All 37 had previously completed a 16-week study where they consumed 100 g of WBM daily and were then followed-up for one month during which no mushrooms were consumed. We analyzed differences in serum risk factors from baseline to 16-week, and from baseline to one-month follow-up. Measurement of serum diabetic risk factors included inflammatory and oxidative stress markers and the antioxidant component naturally rich in mushrooms, ergothioneine. Significant beneficial health effects were observed at 16-week with the doubling of ergothioneine from baseline, increases in the antioxidant marker ORAC (oxygen radical absorption capacity) and anti-inflammatory hormone, adiponectin and significant decreases in serum oxidative stress inducing factors, carboxymethyllysine (CML) and methylglyoxal (MG), but no change in the lipid oxidative stress marker 8-isoprostane, leptin or measures of insulin resistance or glucose metabolism. We conclude that WBM contain a variety of compounds with potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant health benefits that can occur with frequent consumption over time in adults predisposed to T2D. Well-controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings and identify the specific mushroom components beneficial to health.},

	abstract = {The anticancer effects of fisetin, a dietary agent, are largely unknown against human gastric cancer. Herein, we investigated the mechanisms of fisetin-induced inhibition of growth and survival of human gastric carcinoma AGS and SNU-1 cells. Fisetin (25-100 μM) caused significant decrease in the levels of G1 phase cyclins and CDKs, and increased the levels of p53 and its S15 phosphorylation in gastric cancer cells. We also observed that growth suppression and death of non-neoplastic human intestinal FHs74int cells were minimally affected by fisetin. Fisetin strongly increased apoptotic cells and showed mitochondrial membrane depolarization in gastric cancer cells. DNA damage was observed as early as 3 h after fisetin treatment which was accompanied with gamma-H2A.X(S139) phosphorylation and cleavage of PARP. Fisetin-induced apoptosis was observed to be independent of p53. DCFDA and MitoSOX analyses showed an increase in mitochondrial ROS generation in time- and dose-dependent fashion. It also increased cellular nitrite and superoxide generation. Pre-treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) inhibited ROS generation and also caused protection from fisetin-induced DNA damage. The formation of comets were observed in only fisetin treated cells which was blocked by NAC pre-treatment. Further investigation of the source of ROS, using mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complex inhibitors, suggested that fisetin caused ROS generation specifically through complex I. Collectively, these results for the first time demonstrated that fisetin possesses anticancer potential through ROS production most likely via MRC complex I leading to apoptosis in human gastric carcinoma cells. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Osteoporosis is a chronic and asymptomatic disease characterized by low bone mass and skeletal microarchitectural deterioration, increased risk of fracture, and associated comorbidities most prevalent in the elderly. Due to an increasingly aging population, osteoporosis has become a major health issue requiring innovative disease management. Proteins are important for bone by providing building blocks and by exerting specific regulatory function. This is why adequate protein intake plays a considerable role in both bone development and bone maintenance. More specifically, since an increase in the overall metabolism of collagen can lead to severe dysfunctions and a more fragile bone matrix and because orally administered collagen can be digested in the gut, cross the intestinal barrier, enter the circulation, and become available for metabolic processes in the target tissues, one may speculate that a collagen-enriched diet provides benefits for the skeleton. Collagen-derived products such as gelatin or hydrolyzed collagen (HC) are well acknowledged for their safety from a nutritional point of view; however, what is their impact on bone biology? In this manuscript, we critically review the evidence from literature for an effect of HC on bone tissues in order to determine whether HC may represent a relevant alternative in the design of future nutritional approaches to manage osteoporosis prevention.},

	abstract = {Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is important for brain function, and can be obtained directly from the diet or synthesized in the body from α-linolenic acid (ALA). Debate exists as to whether DHA synthesized from ALA can provide sufficient DHA for the adult brain, as measures of DHA synthesis from ingested ALA are typically {\textless}1\% of the oral ALA dose. However, the primary fate of orally administered ALA is β-oxidation and long-term storage in adipose tissue, suggesting that DHA synthesis measures involving oral ALA tracer ingestion may underestimate total DHA synthesis. There is also evidence that DHA synthesized from ALA can meet brain DHA requirements, as animals fed ALA-only diets have brain DHA concentrations similar to DHA-fed animals, and the brain DHA requirement is estimated to be only 2.4-3.8 mg/day in humans. This review summarizes evidence that DHA synthesis from ALA can provide sufficient DHA for the adult brain by examining work in humans and animals involving estimates of DHA synthesis and brain DHA requirements. Also, an update on methods to measure DHA synthesis in humans is presented highlighting a novel approach involving steady-state infusion of stable isotope-labeled ALA that bypasses several limitations of oral tracer ingestion. It is shown that this method produces estimates of DHA synthesis that are at least 3-fold higher than brain uptake rates in rats.},

In another experiment, rats were supplemented for 4weeks with TAG-DHA (fish oil), PL-DHA (roe PL) or a mixture of both for comparison to a low-omega-3 diet. Brain regions and other tissues were collected, and blood was sampled weekly. DHA accretion rates were estimated using the balance method. [U-(3)H]PL-DHA rats had higher radioactivity in cerebellum, hippocampus and remainder of brain, with no differences in other tissues despite higher serum lipid radioactivity in [U-(3)H]TAG-DHA rats. TAG-DHA, PL-DHA or a mixture were equally effective at increasing brain DHA. There were no differences between DHA-supplemented groups in brain region, whole-body, or tissue DHA accretion rates except heart and serum TAG where the PL-DHA/TAG-DHA blend was higher than TAG-DHA. Apparent DHA β-oxidation was not different between DHA-supplemented groups. This indicates that more labeled DHA enters the brain when consumed as PL; however, this may not translate into higher brain DHA concentrations.},

The aim of this paper was to investigate whether cranberry juice intake can improve vascular function in healthy men in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and to understand which of the circulating (poly)phenol metabolites correlate with vascular effects.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A double-blind randomized controlled crossover trial was conducted in ten healthy males. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), blood pressure, pulse wave velocity and augmentation index were investigated at baseline, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h post-consumption of cranberry juices containing 409, 787, 1238, 1534, and 1910 mg of total cranberry (poly)phenols (TP), and a control drink. Plasma (poly)phenol metabolites were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF MS using authentic standards. We observed dose-dependent increases in FMD at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h with a peak at 4 h and maximal effects with juice containing 1238 mg TP. A total of 60 metabolites were quantified in plasma after cranberry consumption. Twelve (poly)phenol metabolites significantly correlated with the increases in FMD, including ferulic and caffeic acid sulfates, quercetin-3-O-ß-D-glucuronide and a γ-valerolactone sulfate.
CONCLUSION: (Poly)phenols in cranberry juice can improve vascular function in healthy males and this is linked to the presence of specific newly identified plasma metabolites.},

	doi = {10.1053/meta.2001.21037},
	abstract = {We tested the effects of feeding a diet very high in fiber from fruit and vegetables. The levels fed were those, which had originally inspired the dietary fiber hypothesis related to colon cancer and heart disease prevention and also may have been eaten early in human evolution. Ten healthy volunteers each took 3 metabolic diets of 2 weeks duration. The diets were: high-vegetable, fruit, and nut (very-high-fiber, 55 g/1,000 kcal); starch-based containing cereals and legumes (early agricultural diet); or low-fat (contemporary therapeutic diet). All diets were intended to be weight-maintaining (mean intake, 2,577 kcal/d). Compared with the starch-based and low-fat diets, the high-fiber vegetable diet resulted in the largest reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (33\% +/- 4\%, P {\textless}.001) and the greatest fecal bile acid output (1.13 +/- 0.30 g/d, P =.002), fecal bulk (906 +/- 130 g/d, P {\textless}.001), and fecal short-chain fatty acid outputs (78 +/- 13 mmol/d, P {\textless}.001). Nevertheless, due to the increase in fecal bulk, the actual concentrations of fecal bile acids were lowest on the vegetable diet (1.2 mg/g wet weight, P =.002). Maximum lipid reductions occurred within 1 week. Urinary mevalonic acid excretion increased (P =.036) on the high-vegetable diet reflecting large fecal steroid losses. We conclude that very high-vegetable fiber intakes reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease and possibly colon cancer. Vegetable and fruit fibers therefore warrant further detailed investigation.},

The aim of this study was to take an in-depth look into the mechanisms affected by the cocoa intake by evaluating the colonic gene expression after nutritional intervention, and to ascertain the role of the fiber of cocoa in these effects.
METHODS: To achieve this, Wistar rats were fed for 3 weeks with either a reference diet, a diet containing 10 \% cocoa (C10), a diet based on cocoa fiber (CF) or a diet containing inulin (I). At the end of the study, colon was excised to obtain the RNA to evaluate the differential gene expression by microarray. Results were validated by RT-PCR.
RESULTS: The C10 group was the group with most changes in colonic gene expression, most of them down-regulated but a few in common with the CF diet. The C10 diet significantly up-regulated the expression of Scgb1a1 and Scnn1 g and down-regulated Tac4, Mcpt2, Fcer1a and Fabp1 by twofold, most of them related to lipid metabolism and immune function. The CF and I diets down-regulated the expression of Serpina10 and Apoa4 by twofold. Similar patterns of expression were found by PCR.
CONCLUSION: Most of the effects attributed to cocoa consumption on genes related to the immune system (B cell and mast cell functionality) and lipid metabolism in the colon tissue were due not only to its fiber content, but also to the possible contribution of polyphenols and other compounds.},

The objective of this study was to determine, for the first time, whether a short-term supplementation with Ubiquinol can prevent oxidative stress associated to strenuous exercise. The participants (n = 100 healthy and well trained, but not on an elite level) were classified in two groups: Ubiquinol (experimental group), and placebo group (control). The protocol consisted of conducting two identical strenuous exercise tests with a rest period between tests of 24 h. Blood and urine samples were collected from the participants before supplementation (basal value) (T1), after supplementation (2 weeks) (T2), after first physical exercise test (T3), after 24 h of rest (T4), and after second physical exercise test (T5).The increase observed in the lactate, isoprostanes, DNA damage, and hydroperoxide levels reveals the severity of the oxidative damage induced by the exercise. There was a reduction in the isoprostanes, 8-OHdG, oxidized LDL, and hydroperoxydes in the supplemented Ubiquinol group, an increase in total antioxidant status, fat soluble antioxidant (both plasma and membrane), and CAT activity. Also, NO in the Ubiquinol-supplemented group was maintained within a narrow range. Oxidative stress induced by strenuous exercise is accumulative and increases transiently in subsequent sessions of physical activity. A short-term supplementation (2 weeks) with Ubiquinol (200 mg/day) before strenuous exercise, decreases oxidative stress and increases plasma NO, fact that could improve endothelial function, energetic substrate supply, and muscle recovery after strenuous exercise. © 2016 BioFactors, 42(6):612-622, 2016.},

Extracts from the tree bark of magnolia species have been used for centuries in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicines to treat a variety of neurological diseases, including anxiety, depression, and seizures. The active ingredients in the extracts have been identified as the bi-phenolic isomers magnolol and honokiol. These compounds were shown to enhance the activity of GABA(A) receptors, consistent with their biological effects. The GABA(A) receptors exhibit substantial subunit heterogeneity, which influences both their functional and pharmacological properties. We examined the activity of magnolol and honokiol at different populations of both neuronal and recombinant GABA(A) receptors to characterize their mechanism of action and to determine whether sensitivity to modulation was dependent upon the receptor's subunit composition. We found that magnolol and honokiol enhanced both phasic and tonic GABAergic neurotransmission in hippocampal dentate granule neurons. In addition, all recombinant receptors examined were sensitive to modulation, regardless of the identity of the α, β, or γ subunit subtype, although the compounds showed particularly high efficacy at δ-containing receptors. This direct positive modulation of both synaptic and extra-synaptic populations of GABA(A) receptors suggests that supplements containing magnolol and/or honokiol would be effective anxiolytics, sedatives, and anti-convulsants. However, significant side-effects and risk of drug interactions would also be expected.},

The actions of honokiol and magnolol on glutamate-induced c-Fos expression in the spinal cord dorsal horn were also examined. Our data showed that honokiol and magnolol blocked glutamate-, substance P- and PGE2-induced inflammatory pain with similar potency and efficacy. Consistently, honokiol and magnolol significantly decreased glutamate-induced c-Fos protein expression in superficial (I-II) laminae of the L4-L5 lumbar dorsal horn. However, honokiol was more selective than magnolol for inhibition of NMDA-induced licking behavioral and thermal hyperalgesia. In contrast, magnolol was more potent to block CHPG-mediated thermal hyperalgesia. These results demonstrate that honokiol and magnolol effectively decreased the inflammatory pain. Furthermore, their different potency on inhibition of nociception provoked by NMDA receptor and mGluR5 activation should be considered.},

Honokiol and magnolol blocked the glutamate- and KCl-evoked Ca(2+) influx with similar potency and efficacy, but did not affect KCl-evoked Na(+) influx. However, honokiol was more specific for blocking NMDA-induced Ca(2+) influx, whereas magnolol influenced with both NMDA- and non-NMDA activated Ca(2+) and Na(+) influx. Moreover, the anti-convulsant effects of these two compounds on NMDA-induced seizures were also evaluated. After honokiol or magnolol (1 and 5 mg/kg, i.p.) pretreatment, the seizure thresholds of NMRI mice were determined by tail-vein infusion of NMDA (10 mg/ml). Data showed that both honokiol and magnolol significantly increased the NMDA-induced seizure thresholds, and honokiol was more potent than magnolol. These results demonstrated that magnolol and honokiol have differential effects on NMDA and non-NMDA receptors, suggesting that the distinct therapeutic applications of these two compounds for neuroprotection should be considered.},

Behavioral (sucrose intake, immobility time of forced swimming test) and biochemical parameters [serotonin (5-HT) in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, gastric mucosa cholecystokinin (CCK) and serum gastrin (GAS) levels] were simultaneously examined in the CUMS rats. 20 mg/kg HMM alone, but not OGR, significantly increased sucrose intake and reduced immobility time in the CUMS rats. Moreover, 20 mg/kg HMM and 14 mg/kg OGR in combination exhibited significant synergistic effects on sucrose intake increase and immobility time reduction in the CUMS rats. HMM elevated 5-HT levels in various brain regions, and OGR reduced gastric mucosa CCK and serum GAS levels in the CUMS rats. These results suggested that the synergistic antidepressant-like effects of compatibility of HMM with OGR might be mediated simultaneously by regulation of the serotonergic and gastroenteric system functions.

In the present study, we reported on the antidepressant-like effects of oral administration of the mixture of honokiol and magnolol in well-validated models of depression in rodents: forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and chronic mild stress (CMS) model. The mixture of honokiol and magnolol significantly decreased immobility time in the mouse FST and TST, and reversed CMS-induced reduction in sucrose consumption to prevent anhedonia in rats. However, this mixture was unable to affect ambulatory or rearing behavior in the mouse open-field test. CMS induced alterations in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in various brain regions of rats. An increase in serum corticosterone concentrations and a reduction in platelet adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity were simultaneously found in the CMS rats. The mixture of honokiol and magnolol at 20 and 40 mg/kg significantly attenuated CMS-induced decreases of 5-HT levels in frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens. And it markedly increased 5-HIAA levels in frontal cortex, striatum and nucleus accumbens at 40 mg/kg and in frontal cortex at 20 mg/kg in the CMS rats. A subsequent reduction in 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was found in hippocampus and nucleus accumbens in the CMS rats receiving this mixture. Furthermore, the mixture of honokiol and magnolol reduced elevated corticosterone concentrations in serum to normalize the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hyperactivity in the CMS rats. It also reversed CMS-induced reduction in platelet AC activity, via upregulating the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway. These results suggested that the mixture of honokiol and magnolol possessed potent antidepressant-like properties in behaviors involved in normalization of biochemical abnormalities in brain 5-HT and 5-HIAA, serum corticosterone levels and platelet AC activity in the CMS rats. Our findings could provide a basis for examining directly the interaction of the serotonergic system, the HPA axis and AC-cAMP pathway underlying the link between depression and treatment with the mixture of honokiol and magnolol.},

STUDY DESIGN AND RESULTS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 11 subjects (7 male, 4 female, ages 47-63 years), 90meqs of oral KCl or Kcitrate per day for 2weeks each increased insulin production as measured by homeostasis model assessment Beta [KCl=86 (CI 81-91), Kcitrate=88 (82-94), placebo=78 (73-83)\%, p{\textless}0.04], but only Kcitrate attenuated insulin resistance as assessed by HOMA-IR (insulin resistance, Kcitrate=2.8 (2.5-3.1), placebo=3.2 (2.9-3.5), p{\textless}0.03) and only Kcitrate increased quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (Quicki, Kcitrate=0.355 (0.305-0.405), placebo=0.320 (0.265-0.375) p{\textless}0.04). These results were confirmed by independent measurements, i.e. HOMA C-peptide and whole body insulin sensitivity index measured during oral glucose tolerance testing. Kcitrate significantly decreased systolic and diastolic 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures (-4.0 (-3 to -5) and -2.7 (-1.9 to -3.5), respectively as compared to placebo, p{\textless}0.02) while KCl was without a significant effect.
CONCLUSIONS: K(+) supplementation in the absence of overt K(+) depletion improves beta-cell function in subjects with combined glucose intolerance. The insulin-sensitizing and hypotensive effect, however, depend on citrate as the accompanying anion.},

	abstract = {Carnosine, a histidine-containing dipeptide, is well known to be associated with skeletal muscle performance. However, there is limited information on the effect of dietary micronutrients on muscle carnosine level. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6, is involved in amino acid metabolisms in the body as a cofactor. We hypothesized that enzymes involved in β-alanine biosynthesis, the rate-limiting precursor of carnosine, may also be PLP dependent. Thus, we examined the effects of dietary vitamin B6 on the muscle carnosine content of rats. Male and female rats were fed a diet containing 1, 7, or 35 mg pyridoxine (PN) HCl/kg for 6 weeks. Carnosine in skeletal muscles was quantified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. In the gastrocnemius muscle of male rats, carnosine concentration was significantly higher in the 7 and 35 mg groups (+70 and +61\%, respectively) than in the 1 mg PN HCl/kg group, whereas that in the soleus muscle of male rats was significantly higher only in the 7 mg group (+43\%) than in the 1 mg PN HCl/kg group (P {\textless} 0.05). In both muscles of female rats, carnosine concentration was significantly higher in the 7 and 35 mg groups (+32 to +226\%) than in the 1 mg PN HCl/kg group (P {\textless} 0.05). We also found that, compared to the 1 mg group, β-alanine concentrations in the 7 and 35 mg groups were markedly elevated in gastrocnemius muscles of male (+153 and +148\%, respectively, P {\textless} 0.05) and female (+381 and +437\%, respectively, P {\textless} 0.05) rats. Noteworthy, the concentrations of ornithine in the 7 and 35 mg groups were decreased in gastrocnemius muscles of male rats (-46 and -54\%, respectively, P {\textless} 0.05), which strongly inversely correlated with β-alanine concentration (r = -0.84, P {\textless} 0.01). In humans, 19\% lower muscle carnosine content was found in soleus muscle of women of the lower plasma PLP tertile, but this was not observed in gastrocnemius muscle or in men. We conclude that adequate dietary vitamin B6 is essential for maintaining carnosine in skeletal muscles of rats. Significantly lower soleus carnosine content among women close to PLP deficiency suggests that a similar phenomenon exists in the humans.},

	abstract = {Cancer continues to be the leading cause of death worldwide. Plants have a long history of use in the treatment of cancer. Honokiol (HNK) is an important bioactive compound found in the bark of Magnolia tree, and has been shown to inhibit cancer growth and metastasis in many cell types in vitro and in animal models. Resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is the major obstacle for cure of cancer. Combination of HNK with many traditional chemotherapeutic drugs as well as radiation sensitizes cancer cells to apoptotic death, suggesting that HNK not only directly inhibits primary cancers and metastasis, but also has potential to overcome drug resistance. Ultimately, this may mean that HNK could be combined with traditional chemotherapies administered at lower doses to significantly reduce toxicity, meanwhile enhance efficacy. As a natural compound, HNK is composed of polyphenols and has been described in many studies targeting multiple key cell signaling molecules. Mitochondria are the main hub for cellular energy production and play an important role in cell survival, and are the key target identified for HNK to mediate cancer cell death, survival, and metastasis. In this review, we have summarized different aspects of HNK's anti-cancer effects from recent accumulated literature, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. This review is primarily focused on the effects of HNK on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, as well as the broader regulation of mitochondrial function and cancer cell metabolism.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We have previously demonstrated that a mixture of curcuminoids extract, hydrolyzed collagen and green tea extract (COT) inhibited inflammatory and catabolic mediator's synthesis by osteoarthritic human chondrocytes. The objective of this study was to identify new targets of COT using genomic and proteomic approaches.
DESIGN: Cartilage specimens were obtained from 12 patients with knee osteoarthritis. Primary human chondrocytes were cultured in monolayer until confluence and then incubated for 24 or 48 hours in the absence or in the presence of human interleukin(IL)-1β (10-11M) and with or without COT, each compound at the concentration of 4 μg/ml. Microarray gene expression profiling between control, COT, IL-1β and COT IL-1β conditions was performed. Immunoassays were used to confirm the effect of COT at the protein level.
RESULTS: More than 4000 genes were differentially expressed between conditions. The key regulated pathways were related to inflammation, cartilage metabolism and angiogenesis. The IL-1β stimulated chemokine ligand 6, matrix metalloproteinase-13, bone morphogenetic protein-2 and stanniocalcin1 gene expressions and protein productions were down-regulated by COT. COT significantly decreased stanniocalcin1 production in basal condition. Serpin E1 gene expression and protein production were down-regulated by IL-1β. COT reversed the inhibitory effect of IL-1β. Serpin E1 gene expression was up-regulated by COT in control condition.
CONCLUSION: The COT mixture has beneficial effect on osteoarthritis physiopathology by regulating the synthesis of key catabolic, inflammatory and angiogenesis factors. These findings give a scientific rationale for the use of these natural ingredients in the management of osteoarthritis.},

This study also investigated the synergic or additive effects of these compounds. Enzymatically isolated primary bovine or human chondrocytes were cultured in monolayer until confluence and then incubated for 24 hours or 48 hours in the absence or in the presence of interleukin-1β and with or without curcuminoids extract, hydrolyzed collagen or green tea extract, added alone or in combination, at different concentrations. Cell viability was neither affected by these compounds, nor by interleukin 1β. In the absence of interleukin-1β, compounds did not significantly affect bovine chondrocytes metabolism. In human chondrocytes and in the absence of interleukin 1β, curcuminoids extract alone or in combination with hydrolyzed collagen and green tea extract significantly inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-3 production. In interleukin-1β-stimulated bovine chondrocytes, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase2, matrix metalloproteinase 3, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type I motifs 4 and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type I motifs 5 expressions were decreased by curcuminoids extract alone or in combination with hydrolyzed collagen and green tea extract. The combination of the three compounds was significantly more efficient to inhibit interleukin-1β stimulated matrix metalloproteinase-3 expression than curcuminoids extract alone. In interleukin-1β-stimulated human chondrocytes, nitric oxide, interleukin-6 and matrix metalloproteinase 3 productions were significantly reduced by curcuminoids extract alone or in combination with hydrolyzed collagen and green tea extract. These findings indicate that a mixture of curcuminoids extract, hydrolyzed collagen and green tea extract has beneficial effects on chondrocytes culture in inflammatory conditions and provide a preclinical basis for the in vivo testing of this mixture.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Vitamin E delta-tocotrienol (VEDT) has demonstrated chemopreventive and antineoplastic activity in preclinical models. The aim of our study was to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of VEDT and its metabolites after single- and multiple-dose administrations in healthy subjects.
METHODS: Thirty-six subjects received from 100 to 1600 mg of oral VEDT as a single dose or twice daily for 14 consecutive days. A 3 + 3 dose escalation design was utilized. Pharmacokinetic data were derived from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays. Serial blood and urine samples were collected before and during VEDT administration, with serum and urine metabolites assessed using HPLC.
RESULTS: No drug-related adverse events were observed. Pharmacokinetic parameters for single and multiple doses were, respectively, as follows (shown as range): time to maximum concentration of 4-9.3 and 4.7-7.3 h, maximum concentration of 795.6-3742.6 and 493.3-3746 ng/mL, half-life of 1.7-5.9 and 2.3-6.9 h, and 0-12 h area under the curve of 4518.7-20,781.4 and 1987.7-22,171.2 ng h/mL. Plasma tocotrienols were significantly increased after VEDT administration, indicating oral bioavailability of VEDT in humans. Plasma and urine levels of metabolites, δ-carboxyethyl hydroxychroman, and δ-carboxymethylbutyl hydroxychroman were elevated after VEDT administration in a dose-dependent manner and were 30-60 times significantly higher than δ-tocotrienol levels. VEDT can be safely administered at doses up to 1600 mg twice daily. Plasma VEDT concentrations were comparable to those obtained in VEDT-treated mice in which tumor growth was delayed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that VEDT can be safely consumed by healthy subjects and achieve bioactive levels, supporting the investigation of VEDT for chemoprevention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date, most studies on the anti-inflammatory effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in humans have used a mixture of the 2 fatty acids in various forms and proportions.
OBJECTIVES: We compared the effects of EPA supplementation with those of DHA supplementation (re-esterified triacylglycerol; 90\% pure) on inflammation markers (primary outcome) and blood lipids (secondary outcome) in men and women at risk of cardiovascular disease.
DESIGN: In a double-blind, randomized, crossover, controlled study, healthy men (n = 48) and women (n = 106) with abdominal obesity and low-grade systemic inflammation consumed 3 g/d of the following supplements for periods of 10 wk: 1) EPA (2.7 g/d), 2) DHA (2.7 g/d), and 3) corn oil as a control with each supplementation separated by a 9-wk washout period. Primary analyses assessed the difference in cardiometabolic outcomes between EPA and DHA.
RESULTS: Supplementation with DHA compared with supplementation with EPA led to a greater reduction in interleukin-18 (IL-18) (-7.0\% ± 2.8\% compared with -0.5\% ± 3.0\%, respectively; P = 0.01) and a greater increase in adiponectin (3.1\% ± 1.6\% compared with -1.2\% ± 1.7\%, respectively; P {\textless} 0.001). Between DHA and EPA, changes in CRP (-7.9\% ± 5.0\% compared with -1.8\% ± 6.5\%, respectively; P = 0.25), IL-6 (-12.0\% ± 7.0\% compared with -13.4\% ± 7.0\%, respectively; P = 0.86), and tumor necrosis factor-α (-14.8\% ± 5.1\% compared with -7.6\% ± 10.2\%, respectively; P = 0.63) were NS. DHA compared with EPA led to more pronounced reductions in triglycerides (-13.3\% ± 2.3\% compared with -11.9\% ± 2.2\%, respectively; P = 0.005) and the cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio (-2.5\% ± 1.3\% compared with 0.3\% ± 1.1\%, respectively; P = 0.006) and greater increases in HDL cholesterol (7.6\% ± 1.4\% compared with -0.7\% ± 1.1\%, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001) and LDL cholesterol (6.9\% ± 1.8\% compared with 2.2\% ± 1.6\%, respectively; P = 0.04). The increase in LDL-cholesterol concentrations for DHA compared with EPA was significant in men but not in women (P-treatment × sex interaction = 0.046).
CONCLUSIONS: DHA is more effective than EPA in modulating specific markers of inflammation as well as blood lipids. Additional studies are needed to determine the effect of a long-term DHA supplementation per se on cardiovascular disease risk. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01810003.},

It has been shown that adherence to a diet rich in fruits and vegetables helps in decreasing blood pressure (BP). This study aimed to investigate the effect of raw beet juice (RBJ) and cooked beet (CB) on BP of hypertensive subjects. In this randomized crossover study, 24 hypertensive subjects aged 25-68 years old were divided into two groups. One group took RBJ for 2 weeks and the other group took CB. After 2 weeks of treatment, both groups had a washout for 2 weeks then switched to the alternate treatment. Each participant consumed 250 ml day(-1) of RBJ or 250 g day(-1) of CB each for a period of 2 weeks. Body weight, BP, flow-mediated dilation (FMD), lipid profile and inflammatory parameters were measured at baseline and after each period. According to the results, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were significantly lower and FMD was significantly higher after treatment with RBJ compared with CB (P{\textless}0.05). FMD was significantly (P{\textless}0.05) increased, but systolic and diastolic BP, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular endothelial adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), hs-CRP, interleukin-6, E-selectin and TNF-α were significantly (P{\textless}0.05) decreased with RBJ or CB. Total antioxidant capacity was increased and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol (TC) were decreased with RBJ but not with CB. Although both forms of beetroot were effective in improving BP, endothelial function and systemic inflammation, the raw beetroot juice had greater antihypertensive effects.

	abstract = {Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global health problem. Although many aspects of NAFLD pathogenesis have been understood, there is a paucity of effective treatments to be used as the second line when lifestyle modification is insufficient. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol from turmeric, has been shown to be effective against development of hepatic steatosis and its progression to steatohepatitis, yet these beneficial effects have not been explored in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of curcumin on hepatic fat content as well as biochemical and anthropometric features of patients with NAFLD. In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, patients with ultrasonographic evidence of NAFLD were randomly assigned to receive an amorphous dispersion curcumin formulation (500 mg/day equivalent to 70-mg curcumin) or matched placebo for a period of 8 weeks. Liver fat content (assessed through ultrasonography), glycemic and lipid profile, transaminase levels, and anthropometric indices were evaluated at baseline and at the end of follow-up period. The clinical trial protocol was registered under the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials ID: IRCT2014110511763N18. Compared with placebo, curcumin was associated with a significant reduction in liver fat content (78.9\% improvement in the curcumin vs 27.5\% improvement in the placebo group). There were also significant reductions in body mass index and serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, glucose, and glycated hemoglobin compared with the placebo group. Curcumin was safe and well tolerated during the course of trial. Findings of the present proof-of-concept trial suggested improvement of different features of NAFLD after a short-term supplementation with curcumin. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coffee is an important source of antioxidants, and consumption of this beverage is associated with many health conditions and a lower mortality risk. However, no study, to our knowledge, has examined whether varying coffee or caffeine consumption levels are associated with telomere length, a biomarker of aging whose shortening can be accelerated by oxidative stress.
OBJECTIVE: We performed a large comprehensive study on how coffee consumption is associated with telomere length.
METHODS: We used data from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), a prospective cohort study of female nurses that began in 1976. We examined the cross-sectional association between coffee consumption and telomere length in 4780 women from the NHS. Coffee consumption information was obtained from validated food-frequency questionnaires, and relative telomere length was measured in peripheral blood leukocytes by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Unconditional logistic regression was used to obtain ORs when the telomere length outcome was dichotomized at the median. Linear regression was used for tests of trend with coffee consumption and telomere length as continuous variables.
RESULTS: Higher total coffee consumption was significantly associated with longer telomeres after potential confounding adjustment. Compared with non-coffee drinkers, multivariable ORs for those drinking 2 to {\textless}3 and â‰¥3 cups of coffee/d were, respectively, 1.29 (95\% CI: 0.99, 1.68) and 1.36 (95\% CI: 1.04, 1.78) (P-trend = 0.02). We found a significant linear association between caffeine consumption from all dietary sources and telomere length (P-trend = 0.02) after adjusting for potential confounders, but not after additionally adjusting for total coffee consumption (P-trend = 0.37).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that higher coffee consumption is associated with longer telomeres among female nurses. Future studies are needed to better understand the influence of coffee consumption on telomeres, which may uncover new knowledge of how coffee consumption affects health and longevity.},

Among many different natural compounds, these extracts contained betanin and its stereoisomer isobetanin, which belongs to the betalain group of highly bioavailable antioxidants. However, a precise identification of the molecules responsible for this tumor-inhibitory effect was still required. We isolated a betanin/isobetanin concentrate from fresh beetroots, corresponding to the highest purified betanin extract used for studying anticancer activities of these molecules. The cytotoxicity of this betanin-enriched extract was then characterized on cancer and normal cells and we highlighted the death signalling pathways involved. Betanin/isobetanin concentrate significantly decreased cancer cell proliferation and viability. Particularly in MCF-7-treated cells, the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins (Bad, TRAILR4, FAS, p53) were strongly increased and the mitochondrial membrane potential was altered, demonstrating the involvement of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Autophagosome vesicles in MCF-7-treated cells were observed, also suggesting autophagic cell death upon betanin/isobetanin treatment. Importantly, the betanin-enriched extract had no obvious effect towards normal cell lines. Our data bring new insight to consider the betanin/isobetanin mix as therapeutic anticancer compound, alone or in combination with classical chemotherapeutic drugs, especially in functional p53 tumors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Herbal medicine has long been used as an alternative medicine for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recently, Moringa oleifera (MO or ma-rum in Thai) leaf has been widely used in T2DM patients. Several studies in diabetes rat model have shown that MO had effect on glucose metabolism. However study in humans is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: Examine effects of MO on plasma glucose and insulin secretion.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Ten healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study (mean age 29 ± 5 years; BMI 20.6 ± 1.5 kg/m2; FPG 81 ± 5 mg/dl). After an overnight fast and every two weeks, subjects received an oral dose of MO at increasing dosages of 0, 1, 2, and 4 g. Plasma glucose (PG) and insulin were collected at baseline and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, and 6 hours after each MO dosage administration. Insulin secretion rate was measured using area under the curve (AUC) of insulin and AUC of insulin/glucose ratio.
RESULTS: After doses of 0, 1, 2, and 4 g MO, mean plasma insulin increased (2.3 ± 0.9, 2.7 ± 1.0, 3.3 ± 1.4, and 4.1 ± 1.7 μU/ml, respectively) despite there being no differences in mean PG (77 ± 6, 78 ± 5, 79 ± 6, and 79 ± 5 mg/dl, respectively). AUC of insulin was greater after high-dose MO (4 g) than after baseline or low-dose MO capsule (1 g) (24.0 ± 3.5 vs. 14.5 ± 1.8 or 16.1 ± 2.0, respectively; p = 0.03), while there was no difference in AUC of glucose. Accordingly, insulin secretion rate represented by AUC of insulin/glucose ratio after high-dose MO was significantly increased by 74\% (P = 0.041), as compared with that of baseline.
CONCLUSION: We concluded that high-dose (4 g) MO leaf powder capsules significantly increased insulin secretion in healthy subjects. These results suggest that MO leaf may be a potential agent in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Further studies of MO in patients with T2DM are needed.},

	abstract = {Oral leukoplakia is a potentially malignant lesion of the oral cavity, for which no effective treatment is available. We investigated the effectiveness of curcumin, a potent inhibitor of NF-κB/COX-2, molecules perturbed in oral carcinogenesis, to treat leukoplakia. Subjects with oral leukoplakia (n = 223) were randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive orally, either 3.6 g/day of curcumin (n = 111) or placebo (n = 112), for 6 months. The primary endpoint was clinical response obtained by bi-dimensional measurement of leukoplakia size at recruitment and 6 months. Histologic response, combined clinical and histologic response, durability and effect of long-term therapy for an additional six months in partial responders, safety and compliance were the secondary endpoints. Clinical response was observed in 75 (67.5\%) subjects [95\% confidence interval (CI), 58.4-75.6] in the curcumin and 62 (55.3\%; 95\% CI, 46.1-64.2) in placebo arm (P = 0.03). This response was durable, with 16 of the 18 (88.9\%; 95\% CI, 67.2-96.9) subjects with complete response in curcumin and 7 of 8 subjects (87.5\%) in placebo arm, demonstrating no relapse after 6 months follow-up. Difference in histologic response between curcumin and placebo was not significant (HR, 0.88, 95\% CI, 0.45-1.71; P = 0.71). Combined clinical and histologic response assessment indicated a significantly better response with curcumin (HR, 0.50; 95\% CI, 0.27-0.92; P = 0.02). Continued therapy, in subjects with partial response at 6 months, did not yield additional benefit. The treatment did not raise any safety concerns. Treatment of oral leukoplakia with curcumin (3.6 g for six months), thus was well tolerated and demonstrated significant and durable clinical response for 6 months.

The aim of the study was to investigate RO extract effect on metabolic parameters in prediabetic patients, adopting a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Forty-four patients (age 59.0 ± 8.2 years, 70.5\% females, HbA1c 5.8 ± 0.4\%) were divided into placebo (n = 13), low-dose RO extract (LRE; n = 14), or high-dose RO extract (HRE; n = 17) groups. Either 900 or 1800 mg per day of RO extract was administered orally. Area under the curve for glucose obtained 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was significantly decreased in the HRE group, compared with the placebo group (-28.1 ± 42.4 vs. +13.4 ± 52.6 mg/dL, p {\textless} 0.05).

Although omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have a beneficial potential pharmacological effect of preventing these psychophysiological symptoms, no clinical data is yet available. Therefore, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Japanese accident survivors.
METHODS: A total of 83 participants received either omega-3 PUFAs (1470mg docosahexaenoic acid and 147mg eicosapentaenoic acid per day) or placebo within 10 days of the accidental injury. After 12-week supplementation, participants performed script-driven imagery of their traumatic event during monitoring of their heart rate and skin conductance.
RESULTS: Analysis revealed that heart rate during both rest and script-driven imagery was significantly lower in the omega-3 group than the placebo group, whereas baseline heart rate was comparable between the two groups.
LIMITATIONS: The present trial was conducted at a single-center in Japan and psychophysiological symptoms of PTSD in most participants were not serious.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that post-trauma supplementation of omega-3 PUFAs might be effective for the secondary prevention of psychophysiological symptoms of PTSD.},

Here, we investigated the impacts of triterpenoid saponins isolated from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GpS) on gut microbiome, mucosal environment, and the preventive effect on tumor growth. Six-week old ApcMin/+ mice and their wild-type littermates were fed either with vehicle or GpS daily for the duration of 8 weeks. The fecal microbiome was analyzed by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR and 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Study showed that GpS treatment significantly reduced the number of intestinal polyps in a preventive mode. More importantly, GpS feeding strikingly reduced the sulfate-reducing bacteria lineage, which are known to produce hydrogen sulfide and contribute to damage the intestinal epithelium or even promote cancer progression. Meanwhile, GpS also boosted the beneficial microbes. In the gut barrier of the ApcMin/+ mice, GpS treatment increased Paneth and goblet cells, up-regulated E-cadherin and down-regulated N-cadherin. In addition, GpS decreased the pro-oncogenic β-catenin, p-Src and the p-STAT3. Furthermore, GpS might also improve the inflamed gut epithelium of the ApcMin/+ mice by upregulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4, while downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-18. Intriguingly, GpS markedly stimulated M2 and suppressed M1 macrophage markers, indicating that GpS altered mucosal cytokine profile in favor of the M1 to M2 macrophages switching, facilitating intestinal tissue repair. In conclusion, GpS might reverse the host's inflammatory phenotype by increasing beneficial bacteria, decreasing sulfate-reducing bacteria, and alleviating intestinal inflammatory gut environment, which might contribute to its cancer preventive effects.},

	abstract = {The inorganic anion nitrate (NO3 (-)), which is naturally enriched in certain vegetables (e.g., spinach and beetroot), has emerged as a dietary component that can regulate diverse bodily functions, including blood pressure, mitochondrial efficiency, and skeletal muscle force. It is not known if dietary nitrate improves cardiac contractility. To test this, mice were supplemented for 1-2 weeks with sodium nitrate in the drinking water at a dose similar to a green diet. The hearts from nitrate-treated mice showed increased left ventricular pressure and peak rate of pressure development as measured with the Langendorff heart technique. Cardiomyocytes from hearts of nitrate-treated and control animals were incubated with the fluorescent indicator Fluo-3 to measure cytoplasmic free [Ca(2+)] and fractional shortening. Cardiomyocytes from nitrate-treated mice displayed increased fractional shortening, which was linked to larger Ca(2+) transients. Moreover, nitrate hearts displayed increased protein expression of the L-type Ca(2+) channel/dihydropyridine receptor and peak L-type Ca(2+) channel currents. The nitrate-treated hearts displayed increased concentration of cAMP but unchanged levels of cGMP compared with controls. These findings provide the first evidence that dietary nitrate can affect the expression of important Ca(2+) handling proteins in the heart, resulting in increased cardiomyocyte Ca(2+) signaling and improved left ventricular contractile function. Our observation shows that dietary nitrate impacts cardiac function and adds understanding to inorganic nitrate as a physiological modulator.},

We investigated if EVOO affects post-prandial glucose and lipid profile in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG).
METHODS: Thirty IFG patients were randomly allocated to a meal containing or not 10 g of EVOO in a cross-over design. Before, 60 min and 120 min after lunch a blood sample was taken to measure glucose, insulin, Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1), dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP4) activity, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and Apo B-48.
RESULTS: The meal containing EVOO was associated with a reduction of glucose (p = 0.009) and DPP4 activity (p {\textless} 0.001) and a significant increase of insulin (p {\textless} 0.001) and GLP-1 (p {\textless} 0.001) compared with the meal without EVOO. Furthermore, the meal containing EVOO showed a significant decrease of triglycerides (p = 0.002) and Apo B-48 (p = 0.002) compared with the meal without EVOO. Total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels did not significantly change between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that in IFG patients EVOO improves post-prandial glucose and lipid profile with a mechanism probably related to incretin up-regulation.},

	abstract = {Transgenic growth hormone mice (TGM) are a recognized model of accelerated aging with characteristics including chronic oxidative stress, reduced longevity, mitochondrial dysfunction, insulin resistance, muscle wasting, and elevated inflammatory processes. Growth hormone/IGF-1 activate the Target of Rapamycin known to promote aging. TGM particularly express severe cognitive decline. We previously reported that a multi-ingredient dietary supplement (MDS) designed to offset five mechanisms associated with aging extended longevity, ameliorated cognitive deterioration and significantly reduced age-related physical deterioration in both normal mice and TGM. Here we report that TGM lose more than 50\% of cells in midbrain regions, including the cerebellum and olfactory bulb. This is comparable to severe Alzheimer's disease and likely explains their striking age-related cognitive impairment. We also demonstrate that the MDS completely abrogates this severe brain cell loss, reverses cognitive decline and augments sensory and motor function in aged mice. Additionally, histological examination of retinal structure revealed markers consistent with higher numbers of photoreceptor cells in aging and supplemented mice. We know of no other treatment with such efficacy, highlighting the potential for prevention or amelioration of human neuropathologies that are similarly associated with oxidative stress, inflammation and cellular dysfunction.

Natural substances like cinnamon extract (CE) could be an additional therapy. We found recently that CE acts anti-inflammatory on mast cells - discussed of being relevant in IBD. Here, we analysed the effects of CE on murine IL-10(-/-) colitis as model for IBD. Mice were treated 12 weeks with or without CE in drinking water. Clinical scores and disease activity index were assessed. Colonic tissue samples were analysed for infiltration, tissue damage, bowel wall thickness, expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, mast cell proteases, tight junction proteins, and NF-κB signaling. Following treatment with CE, symptoms of murine colitis as well as increased infiltration of immune cells, tissue damage and bowel wall thickness in colon tissue of IL-10(-/-) mice were diminished significantly. MIP-2, TNF, IFNγ, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and IL-1β as well as MC-CPA, MCP-1 and MCP-4 were strongly upregulated in IL-10(-/-) mice compared to WT, but noteworthy not in CE group. Expression of tight junction proteins was not influenced by CE. Phosphorylation of IκB was slightly down-regulated in CE treated IL-10(-/-) mice compared to IL-10(-/-) controls. In summary, CE decreases inflammatory symptoms and expression of inflammatory markers in murine IL-10(-/-) colitis. CE has no influence on tight junction proteins, but seems acting via reducing pro-inflammatory mediators and recruitment of neutrophil granulocytes probably by inhibiting NF-κB signaling.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous experimental studies have suggested curcumin as a safe phytochemical that can improve insulin resistance through effects on adiponectin and leptin. This study aimed to investigate the effect of curcumin on circulating adiponectin and leptin concentrations in patients with metabolic syndrome.
METHODS: In this pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, subjects who met the criteria of metabolic syndrome according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria were randomly assigned to curcumin (n = 59; 1000 mg/d) or a placebo (n = 58) for 8 wk. Serum adiponectin and leptin concentrations were determined before and after intervention. The pooled effect size for the impact of curcumin supplementation on serum adiponectin and leptin levels was also estimated using random-effects metaanalysis.
RESULTS: Eight-week supplementation with curcumin was associated with a significant increase in serum adiponectin levels (P {\textless} 0.001) and a reduction in serum leptin concentrations (P {\textless} 0.001). Serum leptin:adiponectin ratio was also improved by curcumin (P {\textless} 0.001). These beneficial effects of curcumin remained significant after adjustment for changes in serum lipids and glucose concentrations and baseline differences in body mass index and serum levels of glucose and glycated hemoglobin as potential confounders of treatment response. Metaanalysis suggested that curcumin supplementation can increase adiponectin levels by 76.78\% (95\% CI: 6.14-147.42; P = 0.0330), and reduce leptin by 26.49\% (95\% CI: -70.44 to 17.46), however this latter effect size did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.238).
CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin can improve serum levels of adiponectin and leptin in patients with metabolic syndrome. This trial was registered at the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/) under Trial No. UMIN000018339.},

METHODS: Sixty-four adult male Wistar rats (300±20 g) were divided into 8 groups: 1) Control (Cont); 2) AD; 3) Sham; 4-7) AD+GA (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg for 10 days, orally) or vehicle, 8) Cont+GA100, Aβ (1μg/μL in each site) was infused into hippocampus bilaterally. Changes of amplitude and slope of LTP induced in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) were evaluated by high frequency stimulation (HFS) of perforant path (PP).
RESULTS: Data showed that LTP amplitude and area under curve significantly impaired in AD rats (P{\textless}0.001), while significantly improved in AD rats treated with GA (P{\textless}0.05, P{\textless}0.01).
CONCLUSION: Current findings suggest that GA reduces neural damage and brain amyloid neuropathology and improves cognitive function via free radicals scavenging and inhibiting oligomerization of Aβ but with no effect on healthy rats.},

	abstract = {Metabolic syndrome is a growing health problem worldwide. It is therefore imperative to develop new strategies to treat this pathology. In the past years, the manipulation of NAD(+) metabolism has emerged as a plausible strategy to ameliorate metabolic syndrome. In particular, an increase in cellular NAD(+) levels has beneficial effects, likely because of the activation of sirtuins. Previously, we reported that CD38 is the primary NAD(+)ase in mammals. Moreover, CD38 knockout mice have higher NAD(+) levels and are protected against obesity and metabolic syndrome. Here, we show that CD38 regulates global protein acetylation through changes in NAD(+) levels and sirtuin activity. In addition, we characterize two CD38 inhibitors: quercetin and apigenin. We show that pharmacological inhibition of CD38 results in higher intracellular NAD(+) levels and that treatment of cell cultures with apigenin decreases global acetylation as well as the acetylation of p53 and RelA-p65. Finally, apigenin administration to obese mice increases NAD(+) levels, decreases global protein acetylation, and improves several aspects of glucose and lipid homeostasis. Our results show that CD38 is a novel pharmacological target to treat metabolic diseases via NAD(+)-dependent pathways.},

While conventional treatment approaches such as surgery and classic chemotherapy have slightly improved the relative five year survival rate to 8\% yet it is the lowest survival rate for any major cancer. This emphasizes the serious need of more effective and well tolerated therapies to reverse the poor prognosis of the defined neoplasm. Aberrant expression of histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes has been implicated in pancreatic cancer signalling. The inhibitors of these enzymes namely HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are the novel agents which are currently being tested. These inhibitors modulate both histone and nonhistone proteins and have shown multiple biological effects including cell cycle arrest, differentiation and apoptosis in several cancer models. This article focuses on plant-derived HDAC inhibitor Sulforaphane (SFN) as a promising antipancreatic cancer agent. Moreover, we discuss the distinct molecular mechanisms triggered by SFN to exert cytotoxic effect in the predefined cancer models. Finally we describe the combinatorial therapeutic strategy involving SFN with other anticancer agents. This novel approach circumvents herculean cancer chemoresistance and alleviates toxicity, the main drawbacks of monotherapy.},

OBJECTIVE: We determined whether plasma free FAs (FFAs) after a moderately high-fat (MHF, 40\% kcal from fat) breakfast modulate the inflammatory status of postprandial blood, and whether blueberry intake suppresses FFA-induced inflammatory responses in healthy humans.
METHODS: Twenty-three volunteers with a mean ± SEM age and body mass index (in kg/m(2)) of 30 ± 3 y and 21.9 ± 0.4, respectively, consumed an MHF breakfast with either a placebo powder or 2 or 4 servings of blueberry powder in a randomized crossover design. The placebo powder was provided on the first test day and the blueberry powder doses were randomized with a 2-wk washout period. Plasma concentrations of lipids, glucose, and cytokines were determined. To determine whether FFAs derived from TGRL stimulate monocyte activation, and whether this is inhibited by blueberry intake, whole blood was treated with lipoprotein lipase (LPL).
RESULTS: The median concentrations of FFAs and cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8] in postprandial plasma (3.5 h) decreased compared with fasting plasma regardless of the blueberry intake (P {\textless} 0.001 for FFAs and P {\textless} 0.05 for cytokines). However, concentrations of FFAs and cytokines including IL-1β increased in LPL-treated whole blood compared with untreated blood samples from participants who consumed the placebo powder. Blueberry intake suppressed IL-1β and IL-6 production in LPL-treated postprandial blood compared with the placebo control when fasting changes were used as a covariate.
CONCLUSIONS: The plasma FFA concentration may be an important determinant affecting inflammatory cytokine production in blood. Supplementation with blueberry powder did not affect plasma FFA and cytokine concentrations; however, it attenuated the cytokine production induced by ex vivo treatment of whole blood with LPL.

The anti-inflammatory property of curcumin and the antispasmodic and carminative effect of fennel suggests that combination of these nutraceutical compounds would be useful in functional bowel disorders including IBS. We assessed the efficacy and tolerability of a combination of curcumin and fennel essential oil (CU-FEO) in IBS symptoms relief.
METHODS: 121 patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms of IBS defined by an Irritable Bowel Syndrome- symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) 100-300 and abdominal pain score 30-70 on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), were randomly assigned to CU-FEO or placebo (2 capsules b.d. for 30 days). Primary endpoint was the mean decrease of IBS-SSS at the end of the treatment corrected for the mean baseline score (relative decrease). The impact of the treatment on quality of life was assessed through IBS-QoL questionnaire.
RESULTS: CU-FEO was safe, well-tolerated and induced symptom relief in patients with IBS; a significant decrease in the mean relative IBS-SSS was observed after 30 days of treatment (50.05 +/- 28.85\% vs 26.12 +/- 30.62\%, P{\textless}0.001). This result matched the reduction of abdominal pain and all the other symptoms of IBS-SSS. The percentage of symptom-free patients was significantly higher in the CU-FEO than in the placebo group (25.9\% vs. 6.8\%, P = 0.005). All domains of IBS-QoL improved consistently.
CONCLUSION: CU-FEO significantly improved symptoms and quality of life in IBS patients over 30 days.},

	abstract = {Despite the large popularity of the Boletus edulis mushroom, little is known about its influence on human health and the possibilities of its therapeutic use. Nevertheless, several reports revealed the usefulness of biopolymers isolated from it in cancer treatment. Our previous studies have shown that B. edulis water soluble biopolymers are not toxic against normal colon epithelial cells (CCD841 CoTr) and at the same concentration range elicited a very prominent antiproliferative effect in colon cancer cells (LS180) which was accompanied with cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. The purpose of the present study was to verify the proapoptotic properties of a selected fraction from B. edulis - BE3, as well as determine its chemical nature. The BE3 fraction was extracted with hot water and purified by anion-exchange chromatography. Further chemical examinations revealed that BE3 consists mainly of ribonucleic acid (59.1\%). The ability of BE3 to induce programmed cell death was examined in human colon cancer cell lines LS180 and HT-29 by measuring caspase activation, DNA fragmentation and expression of BAX, BCL2, TP53 and CDKN1A genes. The sensitivity of colon cancer cells with silenced BAX, TP53 and CDKN1A expression to BE3 treatment was also evaluated. We have demonstrated for the first time that the BE3 fraction is a potent apoptosis inducer in human colon cancer cells. The revealed mechanism of apoptosis triggering was dependent on the presence of functional p53 and consequently was a little different in investigated cell lines. Our results indicated that BE3 stimulated proapoptotic genes BAX (LS180, HT-29), TP53 (LS180) and CDKN1A (HT-29) while at the same time silenced the expression of the key prosurvival gene BCL2 (LS180, HT-29). The obtained results indicate the high therapeutic potential of the BE3 fraction against colon cancer, yet it is necessary to further confirm fraction efficacy and safety in animal and clinical studies.},

The aim of the current study was to assess the influence of aqueous extract of cinnamon (CE) on the monosodium glutamate-induced non-transgenic rat model of AD (NTAD) established with insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, neuronal loss, and cognitive impairment at a very early stage of life.
METHODS: The experimental design included oral administration of CE (50 mg/kg body weight) for 20 weeks to 2-month and 10-month-old NTAD rats. Following the treatments, the animals attained 7 and 15 months of age, respectively. They were then subjected to behavioural testing, biochemical analysis, and stereology experiments.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that CE treatment improved the insulin sensitivity, increased phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (pGSK3β), inhibited the cholinesterase activity, and improved the learning ability in NTAD rats. Histological evaluation has shown an increase in neuron count in the DG sub-field of hippocampus upon treatment with CE.
DISCUSSION: These beneficial effects of CE are suggestive of considering cinnamon as a dietary supplement in modulating the metabolic changes and cognitive functions.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 18 participants were recruited to consume 250 mL of a blackberry puree (650 mg of anthocyanins) without (BBP) or with 12\% ethanol (BBP 12\%). Venous blood was collected from participants at baseline and at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after puree ingestion. Urine samples were collected at baseline and at 120 min. Plasma and urine concentration of anthocyanins and anthocyanin conjugates were quantified by HPLC-DAD. Methyl-cyanidin-glucuronide (Me-Cy-Glucr) and 3'-methyl-cyanidin-3-glucoside (3'-Me-Cy3glc) were the main anthocyanin conjugates detected in all plasma and urine samples. Urinary concentration of these anthocyanin conjugates were positively correlated with their plasma concentration. Ethanol increased plasma Cmax of Me-Cy-Glucr and 3'-Me-Cy3glc. Participants were then stratified according to their body mass index (BMI) and body fat mass. After BBP consumption, plasma Cmax of Me-Cy-Glucr and 3'-Me-Cy3glc tended to be decreased in overweight/obese participants, in comparison to normal weight participants. The increase on plasma Cmax of Me-Cy-Glucr and 3'-Me-Cy3glc induced by ethanol was more pronounced in the group of overweight/obese participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Ethanol seems to enhance Cy3glc metabolism that appears to be compromised in overweight and obese individuals.},

We hypothesised that administration of a green tea extract containing epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) would improve the effects of non-pharmacological cognitive rehabilitation in young adults with Down's syndrome.
METHODS: We enrolled adults (aged 16-34 years) with Down's syndrome from outpatient settings in Catalonia, Spain, with any of the Down's syndrome genetic variations (trisomy 21, partial trisomy, mosaic, or translocation) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2, single centre trial (TESDAD). Participants were randomly assigned at the IMIM-Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute to receive EGCG (9 mg/kg per day) or placebo and cognitive training for 12 months. We followed up participants for 6 months after treatment discontinuation. We randomly assigned participants using random-number tables and balanced allocation by sex and intellectual quotient. Participants, families, and researchers assessing the participants were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was cognitive improvement assessed by neuropsychologists with a battery of cognitive tests for episodic memory, executive function, and functional measurements. Analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01699711.
FINDINGS: The study was done between June 5, 2012, and June 6, 2014. 84 of 87 participants with Down's syndrome were included in the intention-to-treat analysis at 12 months (43 in the EGCG and cognitive training group and 41 in the placebo and cognitive training group). Differences between the groups were not significant on 13 of 15 tests in the TESDAD battery and eight of nine adaptive skills in the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System II (ABAS-II). At 12 months, participants treated with EGCG and cognitive training had significantly higher scores in visual recognition memory (Pattern Recognition Memory test immediate recall, adjusted mean difference: 6·23 percentage points [95\% CI 0·31 to 12·14], p=0·039; d 0·4 [0·05 to 0·84]), inhibitory control (Cats and Dogs total score, adjusted mean difference: 0·48 [0·02 to 0·93], p=0·041; d 0·28 [0·19 to 0·74]; Cats and Dogs total response time, adjusted mean difference: -4·58 s [-8·54 to -0·62], p=0·024; d -0·27 [-0·72 to -0·20]), and adaptive behaviour (ABAS-II functional academics score, adjusted mean difference: 5·49 [2·13 to 8·86], p=0·002; d 0·39 [-0·06 to 0·84]). No differences were noted in adverse effects between the two treatment groups.
INTERPRETATION: EGCG and cognitive training for 12 months was significantly more effective than placebo and cognitive training at improving visual recognition memory, inhibitory control, and adaptive behaviour. Phase 3 trials with a larger population of individuals with Down's syndrome will be needed to assess and confirm the long-term efficacy of EGCG and cognitive training.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyse the nutraceutical properties of table green olives Nocellara del Belice, a traditional Mediterranean food. The Mediterranean Diet has as key elements olives and extra virgin olive oil, common to all Mediterranean countries. Olive oil is the main source of fat and can modulate oxidative stress and inflammation, whereas little is known about the role of olives. Moreover, emerging evidences underline the association between gut microbiota and food as the basis of many phenomena that affect health and delay or avoid the onset of some age-related chronic diseases.
METHODS: In order to show if table green olives have nutraceutical properties and/or probiotic effect, we performed a nutritional intervention, administering to 25 healthy subjects (mean age 38,3), 12 table green olives/day for 30Â days. We carried out anthropometric, biochemical, oxidative stress and cytokines analyses at the beginning of the study and at the end. Moreover, we also collected fecal samples to investigate about the possible variation of concentration of Lactobacilli, after the olives consumption.
RESULT: Our results showed a significant variation of one molecule related to oxidative stress, malondialdehyde, confirming that Nocellara del Belice green olives could have an anti-oxidant effect. In addition, the level of interleukin-6 decreased significantly, demonstrating how this food could be able to modulate the inflammatory response. Moreover, it is noteworthy the reduction of fat mass with an increase of muscle mass, suggesting a possible effect on long time assumption of table olives on body mass variation. No statistically significant differences were observed in the amount of Lactobacilli, although a trend towards an increased concentration of them at the end of the intervention could be related to the nutraceutical effects of olives.
CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest a possible nutraceutical effect of daily consumption of green table olives Nocellara del Belice. To best of our knowledge, this is the first study performed to assess nutraceutical properties of this food. Of course, it is necessary to verify the data in a larger sample of individuals to confirm their role as nutraceuticals.},

In contrast to the well-studied SFN, little is known about the molecular pathways targeted by GMG-ITC. We investigated the ability of GMG-ITC to inhibit essential signaling pathways that are frequently upregulated in cancer and immune disorders, such as JAK/STAT and NF-κB. We report for the first time that, similarly to SFN, GMG-ITC in the nanomolar range suppresses IL-3-induced expression of STAT5 target genes. GMG-ITC, like SFN, does not inhibit STAT5 phosphorylation, suggesting a downstream inhibitory event. Interestingly, treatment with GMG-ITC or SFN had a limited inhibitory effect on IFNα-induced STAT1 and STAT2 activity, indicating that both isothiocyanates differentially target JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Furthermore, we showed that GMG-ITC in the micromolar range is a more potent inhibitor of TNF-induced NF-κB activity than SFN. Finally, using a cellular system mimicking constitutive active STAT5-induced cell transformation, we demonstrated that SFN can reverse the survival and growth advantage mediated by oncogenic STAT5 and triggers cell death, therefore providing experimental evidence of a cancer chemopreventive activity of SFN. This work thus identified STAT5, and to a lesser extent STAT1/STAT2, as novel targets of moringin. It also contributes to a better understanding of the biological activities of the dietary isothiocyanates GMG-ITC and SFN and further supports their apparent beneficial role in the prevention of chronic illnesses such as cancer, inflammatory diseases and immune disorders.},

In subjects with Δbody mass less than 2.3kg (5 lb.), resistance artery endothelial function, assessed by forearm blood flow to brachial artery infusion of acetylcholine (FBFACh), increased {\textasciitilde}30\% with trehalose (13.3±1.0 vs. 10.5±1.1 AUC, P=0.02), but not maltose (P=0.40). This improvement in FBFACh was abolished when endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production was inhibited.

Trehalose supplementation had no effect on conduit artery endothelial function, large elastic artery stiffness or circulating markers of oxidative stress or inflammation (all P{\textgreater}0.1) independent of changes in body weight. Our findings demonstrate that oral trehalose improves resistance artery (microvascular) function, a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, in MA/O adults, possibly through increasing NO bioavailability and smooth muscle sensitivity to NO.},

Both compounds are also endogenously synthesized in our body as byproducts of dopamine and tyramine metabolisms, respectively. Over the last decades, research into hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol has experienced an increasing interest due to the role that these compounds may play in the prevention of certain pathologies (e.g. cardiovascular, metabolic, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer). The translation of promising in vitro and in vivo biological effects from preclinical studies to the context of human disease prevention initially depends on whether the dose ingested becomes available at the site of action. In this regard, information regarding the bioavailability and metabolic disposition of hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol is of most importance to evaluate the impact they may have on human health. In this review, we discuss and summarize the state of the art of the scientific evidence regarding the processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of both hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol. We also examine the impact of these compounds and their metabolites on biological activity in terms of beneficial health effects. Finally, we evaluate the different analytical approaches that have been developed to measure the plasma and urinary levels of hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol and their metabolites.},

The results showed that curcumin induced liver injury through the generation of the overexpression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and the decreases of the levels of antioxidant enzyme SOD and detoxified enzyme GST. Meanwhile, for the self-protection of rats, curcumin treatment activated the transcription of Nrf-2 and elevated the expression of HO-1 to reduce tissue damage. Furthermore, curcumin significantly increased key mRNA levels of HK2, PKM2, LDHA, CES, Cpt1, Cpt2, FASN, and ATP5b and decreased levels of GLUT2 and ACC1 to enhance glycolysis and inhibit lipid metabolism and TCA cycle. Therefore, overdose or long-term intake of curcumin could initiate the unbalanced state of bodies through oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolic disorders, which induces liver injury.

The natural flavonoid compound luteolin (2-(3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)- 5,7-dihydroxy-4-chromenone) has been reported to have antidepressant, antinociceptive, and anxiolytic-like effects, which possibly involve the mechanisms of modulating GABA signaling. However, as yet detailed studies of the pharmacological effects of luteolin are still lacking, we investigated the effects of luteolin on recombinant and endogenous GABAAR-mediated current responses by electrophysiological approaches. Our results showed that luteolin inhibited GABA-mediated currents and slowed the activation kinetics of recombinant α1β2, α1β2γ2, α5β2, and α5β2γ2 receptors with different degrees of potency and efficacy. The modulatory effect of luteolin was likely dependent on the subunit composition of the receptor complex: the αβ receptors were more sensitive than the αβγ receptors. In hippocampal pyramidal neurons, luteolin significantly reduced the amplitude and slowed the rise time of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). However, GABAAR-mediated tonic currents were not significantly influenced by luteolin. These data suggested that luteolin has negative modulatory effects on both recombinant and endogenous GABAARs and inhibits phasic rather than tonic inhibition in hippocampus.},

	abstract = {The gut/brain peptide, glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1), suppresses food intake by acting on receptors located in key energy balance regulating CNS areas, the hypothalamus or the hindbrain. Moreover, GLP-1 can reduce reward derived from food and motivation to obtain food by acting on its mesolimbic receptors. Together these data suggest a neuroanatomical segregation between homeostatic and reward effects of GLP-1. Here we aim to challenge this view and hypothesize that GLP-1 can regulate food reward behavior by acting directly on the hindbrain, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R). Using two models of food reward, sucrose progressive ratio operant conditioning and conditioned place preference for food in rats, we show that intra-NTS microinjections of GLP-1 or Exendin-4, a stable analogue of GLP-1, inhibit food reward behavior. When the rats were given a choice between palatable food and chow, intra-NTS Exendin-4 treatment preferentially reduced intake of palatable food but not chow. However, chow intake and body weight were reduced by the NTS GLP-1R activation if chow was offered alone. The NTS GLP-1 activation did not alter general locomotor activity and did not induce nausea, measured by PICA. We further show that GLP-1 fibers are in close apposition to the NTS noradrenergic neurons, which were previously shown to provide a monosynaptic connection between the NTS and the mesolimbic system. Central GLP-1R activation also increased NTS expression of dopamine-β-hydroxylase, a key enzyme in noradrenaline synthesis, indicating a biological link between these two systems. Moreover, NTS GLP-1R activation altered the expression of dopamine-related genes in the ventral tegmental area. These data reveal a food reward-suppressing role of the NTS GLP-1R and indicate that the neurobiological targets underlying food reward control are not limited to the mesolimbic system, instead they are distributed throughout the CNS.},

We performed an unbiased intestinal miRNA screening in mice supplemented (for 8 weeks) with nutritionally relevant amounts of HT. HT modulated the expression of several miRNAs. Analysis of other tissues revealed consistent HT-induced modulation of only few miRNAs. Also, HT administration increased triglycerides levels. Acute treatment with HT and in vitro experiments provided mechanistic insights. The HT-induced expression of one miRNA was confirmed in healthy volunteers supplemented with HT in a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial. HT consumption affects specific miRNAs' expression in rodents and humans. Our findings suggest that the modulation of miRNAs' action through HT consumption might partially explain its healthful activities and might be pharmanutritionally exploited in current therapies targeting endogenous miRNAs.

CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary data of the potential risks of a long-term DIY dietary supplementation and a high protein diet. In this case, permanent abdominal discomfort was evidenced in an amateur body builder with an intake exceeding tolerable upper limit for vitamin A, selenium and zinc, according to our national and updated recommendations. As many amateur athletes usually adopt self-made diets and supplementation, it would be advisable for them to be supervised in order to prevent health risks due to a long-term DIY diet and over-supplementation.},

	abstract = {SCOPE: Cocoa, rich in flavan-3-ols, improves vascular function, but the contribution of specific flavan-3-ols is unknown. We compared the effects of pure epicatechin, a major cocoa flavan-3-ol, and chocolate.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a randomized crossover study, twenty healthy men (40-80 years) were supplemented with: (1) 70g dark chocolate (150 mg epicatechin) with placebo capsules; (2) pure epicatechin capsules (2 Ã— 50 mg epicatechin) with 75g white chocolate; and (3) placebo capsules with 75 g white chocolate (0 mg epicatechin). Vascular function (flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and augmentation index (AIx)) were measured before and 2 hours after interventions. Epicatechin metabolites time-profiles were measured in blood to calculate the bioavailability. Pure epicatechin did not significantly improve FMD (+0.75\%; p = 0.10) or AIx (-2.2\%; p = 0.23) compared to placebo. Dark chocolate significantly improved FMD (+0.96\%; p = 0.04) and AIx (-4.6\%; p = 0.02). Differences in improvements in FMD (+ 0.21\%; p = 0.65) or Aix (-2.4\%; p = 0.20) between pure epicatechin and dark chocolate were not significant. The bioavailability of epicatechin did not differ between pure epicatechin and dark chocolate (p = 0.14).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite differences in epicatechin dose, improvements in vascular function after pure epicatechin and chocolate were similar and the bioavailability did not differ, suggesting a role for epicatechin.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Both inorganic nitrate and citrulline are known to alter the arginine-nitric oxide-nitrate system to increase the bioavailability of nitric oxide with potential benefits in the treatment of heart failure. However, their effects on cardiac electrical activity, vascular compliance and peripheral conductance are less well understood. This study examined the effect of nitrate and citrulline on cardiac electrical activity and blood flow.
METHODS: Young adult subjects (n = 12) were recruited to investigate the effects of acute oral nitrate consumption (8 mg/kg) and chronic citrulline consumption (3 g/day) on cardiac electrical activity measured by ECG recording and blood pressure. Blood flow and vascular compliance were measured by IR-plethysmography at the thumb and the hallux.
RESULTS: Nitrate (p {\textless} 0.05) and citrulline (p {\textless} 0.01) consumption both decreased diastolic blood pressure but had no effect on either pulse pressure or rate-pressure product (NS for both). Citrulline also decreased systolic pressure (p {\textless} 0.01). Nitrate and citrulline both decreased vascular compliance (p {\textless} 0.05 for both) prior to isometric grip exercise, but this was increased for nitrate following exercise (NS). Citrulline decreased R-R interval 9 \% (p {\textless} 0.05) at rest and increased heart rate (p {\textless} 0.05) in addition to significantly decreasing pulse transit duration (6 \%; p {\textless} 0.05). QRS duration was also decreased by 5 \% for citrulline (p {\textless} 0.05) with the reduction in R-R interval.
CONCLUSION: Both nitrate and citrulline supplementation decreased vascular tone at rest but citrulline also altered sympathovagal balance to increase sympathetic tone. We suggest that both oral nitrate and citrulline may be suitable adjuvants for patients with heart failure to improve peripheral tissue oxygenation.},

Beverages derived from broccoli sprout extracts (BSE) that are rich in glucoraphanin and its bioactive metabolite sulforaphane promote detoxication of airborne pollutants in humans. Herein, we investigated the potential chemopreventive activity of sulforaphane using in vitro models of normal and malignant mucosal epithelial cells and an in vivo model of murine oral cancer resulting from the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO). Sulforaphane treatment of Het-1A, a normal mucosal epithelial cell line, and 4 HNSCC cell lines led to dose- and time-dependent induction of NRF2 and the NRF2 target genes NQO1 and GCLC, known mediators of carcinogen detoxication. Sulforaphane also promoted NRF2-independent dephosphorylation/inactivation of pSTAT3, a key oncogenic factor in HNSCC. Compared with vehicle, sulforaphane significantly reduced the incidence and size of 4NQO-induced tongue tumors in mice. A pilot clinical trial in 10 healthy volunteers evaluated the bioavailability and pharmacodynamic activity of three different BSE regimens, based upon urinary sulforaphane metabolites and NQO1 transcripts in buccal scrapings, respectively. Ingestion of sulforaphane-rich BSE demonstrated the greatest, most consistent bioavailability. Mucosal bioactivity, defined as 2-fold or greater upregulation of NQO1 mRNA, was observed in 6 of 9 evaluable participants ingesting glucoraphanin-rich BSE; 3 of 6 ingesting sulforaphane-rich BSE; and 3 of 9 after topical-only exposure to sulforaphane-rich BSE. Together, our findings demonstrate preclinical chemopreventive activity of sulforaphane against carcinogen-induced oral cancer, and support further mechanistic and clinical investigation of sulforaphane as a chemopreventive agent against tobacco-related HNSCC.

As the current article shows, boron has been proven to be an important trace mineral because it (1) is essential for the growth and maintenance of bone; (2) greatly improves wound healing; (3) beneficially impacts the body's use of estrogen, testosterone, and vitamin D; (4) boosts magnesium absorption; (5) reduces levels of inflammatory biomarkers, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α); (6) raises levels of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase; (7) protects against pesticide-induced oxidative stress and heavy-metal toxicity; (8) improves the brains electrical activity, cognitive performance, and short-term memory for elders; (9) influences the formation and activity of key biomolecules, such as S-adenosyl methionine (SAM-e) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)); (10) has demonstrated preventive and therapeutic effects in a number of cancers, such as prostate, cervical, and lung cancers, and multiple and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; and (11) may help ameliorate the adverse effects of traditional chemotherapeutic agents. In none of the numerous studies conducted to date, however, do boron's beneficial effects appear at intakes {\textgreater} 3 mg/d. No estimated average requirements (EARs) or dietary reference intakes (DRIs) have been set for boron-only an upper intake level (UL) of 20 mg/d for individuals aged ≥ 18 y. The absence of studies showing harm in conjunction with the substantial number of articles showing benefits support the consideration of boron supplementation of 3 mg/d for any individual who is consuming a diet lacking in fruits and vegetables or who is at risk for or has osteopenia; osteoporosis; osteoarthritis (OA); or breast, prostate, or lung cancer.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Several experimental studies and clinical trials support the potential of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L) extracts in promoting eye health and circulation. Many active ingredients have been isolated from the berries and leaves of the bilberry plant. However, anthocyanins represent the most widely studied bioactive compounds in this plant.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The aim of this registry, supplement study was to evaluate the effects of Mirtoselect® (standardized in 36\% anthocyanins and obtained by an industrial extraction process that preserves the full range of the non-anthocyanin components, mainly natural sugars and polyphenols) in different types of retinal vasculopathies. In total, 140 patients with different types of retinopathy spontaneously decided to join one of the following groups: standard management (SM) only (n=38); SM associated with Mirtoselect® supplementation (n=47); SM associated with a generic bilberry extract supplementation (n=55). Retinal circulatory parameters and flow measurements of the retinal vessels were evaluated at the inclusion and after 6-months supplementation.
RESULTS: Overall, significant improvements in several retinal circulatory parameters such as retinal blood flow velocity, with respect to the values at inclusion, were observed in both supplementation groups, especially in Mirtoselect® supplementation group. However, at 6 months, inter-group comparison revealed a statistical advantage in all tested parameters for Mirtoselect® supplementation groups. No side effects or tolerability concerns were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Our registry study suggests that Mirtoselect® supplementation could represent an effective and safe integrated approach for the treatment of different retinopathies.},

Both phenomena have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the effect of folic acid on AD itself is unclear. We quantified folate supplementation's effect on inflammation and cognitive function in patients with AD over the course of 6 months. Methods. Patients newly diagnosed with AD (age {\textgreater} 60 years; n = 121; mild to severe; international criteria) and being treated with donepezil were randomly assigned into two groups with (intervention group) or without (control group) supplemental treatment with folic acid (1.25 mg/d) for 6 months. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered to all patients at baseline and follow-up, and blood samples were taken before and after treatment. We quantified serum folate, amyloid beta (Aβ), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), plasma homocysteine (Hcy), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and the mRNA levels of presenilin (PS), IL-6, and TNFα in leukocytes. Data were analyzed using a repeated-measures mixed model. Results. The mean MMSE was slightly increased in the intervention group compared to that in the control group (P {\textless} 0.05). Posttreatment, plasma SAM and SAM/SAH levels were significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.05), while Aβ 40, PS1-mRNA, and TNFα-mRNA levels were lower in the intervention group than in the control group (P {\textless} 0.05). The Aβ 42/Aβ 40 ratio was also higher in the intervention group (P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions. Folic acid is beneficial in patients with AD.

Oral administration of β-cryptoxanthin (0.1-1 mg/kg) to antigen-induced arthritic rats suppressed the loss of glycosaminoglycans in articular cartilage, which is accompanied by the interference of aggrecanase-mediated degradation of aggrecan. Inhibition of the interleukin 1α (IL-1α)-induced aggrecan degradation by β-cryptoxanthin was also observed with porcine articular cartilage explants in culture. β-Cryptoxanthin (1-10 μM) dose-dependently down-regulated the IL-1α-induced gene expression of aggrecanase 1 (ADAMTS-4) and aggrecanase 2 (ADAMTS-5) in cultured human chondrocytes. Moreover, β-cryptoxanthin was found to augment the gene expression of aggrecan core protein in chondrocytes.

Nevertheless, no clear data exist on the effects of prolonged combined dietary supplementation of DHA and lecithin on RBC and plasma PUFA levels. In the current experiments, levels of DHA and choline, two dietary ingredients that enhance neuronal membrane formation and function, were determined in plasma and red blood cells (RBC) from rats after dietary supplementation of DHA-containing oils with and without concomitant dietary supplementation of crude lecithin for 2-3Â weeks. The aim was to provide experimental evidence for the hypothesized additive effects of dietary lecithin (not containing any DHA) on top of dietary DHA on PUFA levels in plasma and RBC. Dietary supplementation of DHA-containing oils, either as vegetable algae oil or as fish oil, increased DHA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and total n-3 PUFA, and decreased total omega-6 PUFA levels in plasma and RBC, while dietary lecithin supplementation alone did not affect these levels. However, combined dietary supplementation of DHA and lecithin increased the changes induced by DHA supplementation alone. Animals receiving a lecithin-containing diet also had a higher plasma free choline concentration as compared to controls. In conclusion, dietary DHA-containing oils and crude lecithin have synergistic effects on increasing plasma and RBC n-3 PUFA levels, including DHA and EPA. By increasing the systemic availability of dietary DHA, dietary lecithin may increase the efficacy of DHA supplementation when their intake is combined.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stomach fullness is a determinant of satiety. Although both the viscosity and energy content have been shown to delay gastric emptying, their relative importance is not well understood.
OBJECTIVE: We compared the relative effects of and interactions between the viscosity and energy density on gastric emptying and perceived satiety.
DESIGN: A total of 15 healthy men [mean ± SD age: 22.6 ± 2.4 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 22.6 ± 1.8] participated in an experiment with a randomized 2 × 2 crossover design. Participants received dairy-based shakes (500 mL; 50\% carbohydrate, 20\% protein, and 30\% fat) that differed in viscosity (thin and thick) and energy density [100 kcal (corresponding to 0.2 kcal/mL) compared with 500 kcal (corresponding to 1 kcal/mL)]. After ingestion, participants entered an MRI scanner where abdominal scans and oral appetite ratings on a 100-point scale were obtained every 10 min until 90 min after ingestion. From the scans, gastric content volumes were determined.
RESULTS: Overall, the gastric emptying half-time (GE t50) was 54.7 ± 3.8 min. The thin 100-kcal shake had the lowest GE t50 of 26.5 ± 3.0 min, followed by the thick 100-kcal shake with a GE t50 of 41 ± 3.9 min and the thin 500-kcal shake with a GE t50 of 69.5 ± 5.9 min, and the thick 500-kcal shake had the highest GE t50 of 81.9 ± 8.3 min. With respect to appetite, the thick 100-kcal shake led to higher fullness (58 points at 40 min) than the thin 500-kcal shake (48 points at 40 min).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that increasing the viscosity is less effective than increasing the energy density in slowing gastric emptying. However, the viscosity is more important to increase the perceived fullness. These results underscore the lack of the satiating efficiency of empty calories in quickly ingested drinks such as sodas. The increase in perceived fullness that is due solely to the increased viscosity, which is a phenomenon that we refer to as phantom fullness, may be useful in lowering energy intake.

The present study aimed at evaluating the effects of a polyphenol-rich extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) (high-polyphenol EVOO, HP-EVOO) on the metabolic control and the production of specific pro-/anti-inflammatory adipokines in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).
METHODS: Eleven overweight T2D patients not in treatment with insulin were invited to follow their habitual diet for a total of 8 weeks. During the first 4 weeks (wash-out period), they were asked to consume refined olive oil (ROO, polyphenols not detectable) and then to replace ROO with HP-EVOO (25 mL/day, 577 mg of phenolic compounds/kg) for the remaining 4 weeks. Anthropometric parameters, fasting glycaemia, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), high-sensitive C-reactive protein, plasma lipid profile, liver function and serum levels of TNF-α, IL-6, adiponectin, visfatin and apelin were assessed at the end of each 4-week period.
RESULTS: HP-EVOO consumption significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose (P = 0.023) and HbA1c (P = 0.039) levels as well as BMI (P = 0.012) and body weight (P = 0.012). HP-EVOO ingestion determined a reduction in serum level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST, P = 0.0056) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT, P = 0.024). Serum visfatin levels strongly decreased after HP-EVOO ingestion (P = 0.0021).
CONCLUSIONS: Daily consumption of polyphenol-rich EVOO might improve metabolic control and circulating inflammatory adipokines profile in overweight T2D patients.},

GT3 protects mice against high doses of ionizing radiation and induces high levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). GT3-induced G-CSF in conjunction with AMD3100 (a chemokine receptor antagonist clinically used to improve the yield of mobilized progenitors) mobilizes progenitors; these mobilized progenitors mitigate injury when infused to mice exposed to acute, high-dose ionizing radiation. The administration of a G-CSF antibody to GT3-injected donor mice abrogated the radiomitigative efficacy of blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in irradiated recipient mice. The efficacy of GT3-injected donor mice blood or PBMC was comparable to a recently published article involving blood or mononuclear cells obtained from mice injected with G-CSF. The injected progenitors were found to localize in various tissues of irradiated hosts. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of a bridging therapy in a preclinical animal model that allows the lymphohematopoietic system of severely immunocompromised mice to recover. This suggests that GT3 is a highly effective agent for radioprotection and mobilizing progenitors with significant therapeutic potential. Therefore, GT3 may be considered for further translational development and ultimately for use in humans.},

Cholesterols, fasting glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin, and proinflammatory markers in the blood as well as waist circumference and \% body fat were lower post intervention in the RS4 group compared with the control group. 16S-rRNA gene sequencing revealed a differential abundance of 71 bacterial operational taxonomic units, including the enrichment of three Bacteroides species and one each of Parabacteroides, Oscillospira, Blautia, Ruminococcus, Eubacterium, and Christensenella species in the RS4 group. Gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry revealed higher faecal SCFAs, including butyrate, propionate, valerate, isovalerate, and hexanoate after RS4-intake. Bivariate analyses showed RS4-specific associations of the gut microbiota with the host metabolic functions and SCFA levels. Here we show that dietary RS4 induced changes in the gut microbiota are linked to its biological activity in individuals with signs of MetS.

	doi = {10.1177/0148607198022005286},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: During sepsis, lipid metabolism is shunted toward triacylglycerol synthesis and hepatic lipogenesis. A decrease in ketogenesis from free fatty acids also is observed, probably mediated by cytokines involved in host response to infection. Whether such an inhibition of ketogenesis occurs with other ketone body precursors such as ketoacids is not known. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) on hepatic ketone body production from octanoic acid, a medium-chain fatty acid, and from alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC), the ketoanalogue of leucine.
METHODS: The experiments were conducted in cultured hepatocytes isolated from 24-hour-fasted Sprague-Dawley rats. Hepatocyte monolayers were incubated for 6 hours, with either KIC or octanoic acid (1 mmol/L), in the presence of glucagon and TNF-alpha (25 micro/L) IL-6 (15 microg/L) and/or IL-6. Acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and free fatty acids were determined in culture medium by enzymatic methods and KIC was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.
RESULTS: KIC and octanoic acid uptake by hepatocytes was 79\% and 92\%, respectively, over 6 hours, and cytokines had no influence. However, TNF-alpha and IL-6 caused inhibition of ketogenesis from alpha-ketoisocaproate (5.6\% +/- 2.3\% and 4.4\% +/- 3.0\%, respectively), and from octanoic acid (7.9\% +/- 2.9\%, 5.7\% +/- 3.2\%, respectively). In addition, when the two cytokines were present together in the culture medium, the inhibition was enhanced (inhibition of ketogenesis from KIC: 14.0\% +/- 4.8\%; from octanoic acid: 11.6\% +/- 3.4\%).
CONCLUSIONS: In our experimental conditions, cytokines mediate an inhibition of ketogenesis; this process could be explained by a direct effect of cytokines on metabolic pathways of octanoic acid and KIC oran indirect effect by modification of the mitochondrial redox state.},

In this study, effects of taurine on mice gut microbes and metabolism were investigated. BALB/C mice were randomly divided into three experimental groups: The first group was administered saline (CK), the second was administered 165 mg/kg natural taurine (NE) and the third one administered 165 mg/kg synthetic taurine (CS). Gut microbiota composition in mice feces was analyzed by metagenomics technology, and the content of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in mice feces was detected by gas chromatography (GC), while the concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were detected by a LPS ELISA kit and a SOD assay kit, respectively. The results showed that the effect of taurine on gut microbiota could reduce the abundance of Proteobacteria, especially Helicobacter. Moreover, we found that the SCFA content was increased in feces of the NE group while LPS content was decreased in serum of the NE group; the SOD activity in serum and livers of the NE and CS groups were not changed significantly compare to that of the CK group. In conclusion, taurine could regulate the gut micro-ecology, which might be of benefit to health by inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria, accelerating the production of SCFA and reducing LPS concentration.},

A new method for compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) by coupling high-temperature reversed-phase liquid chromatography to isotope ratio mass spectrometry (HT-RPLC/IRMS) was developed for discrimination of natural and synthetic caffeine contained in all types of drinks. The analytical parameters such as stationary phase, column inner diameter, and column temperature were optimized for the separation of caffeine directly from drinks (without extraction). On the basis of the carbon isotope analysis of 42 natural caffeine samples including coffee beans, tea leaves, guaraná powder, and maté leaves, and 20 synthetic caffeine samples from different sources by high-temperature reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry, it is concluded that there are two distinguishable groups of caffeine δ(13)C-values: one between -25 and -32‰ for natural caffeine, and the other between -33 and -38‰ for synthetic caffeine. Isotope analysis by HT-RPLC/IRMS has been applied to identify the caffeine source in 38 drinks. Four mislabeled products were detected due to added but nonlabeled synthetic caffeine with δ(13)C-values lower than -33‰. This work is the first application of HT-RPLC/IRMS to real-world food samples, which showed several advantages: simple sample preparation (only dilution), high throughput, long-term column stability, and high precision of δ(13)C-value. Thus, HT-RPLC/IRMS can be a very promising tool in stable isotope analysis of nonvolatile compounds.},

It has been traditionally and clinically used in the treatment of several diseases. Many reviews have investigated this valuable plant, but none of them focused on its clinical effects. Therefore, the aim of the present review is to provide a comprehensive report of clinical studies on N. sativa and some of its constituents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies on the clinical effects of N. sativa and its main constituent, thymoquinone, which were published between 1979 and 2015, were searched using various databases.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: During the last three decades, several in vivo and in vitro animal studies revealed the pharmacological properties of the plant, including its antioxidant, antibacterial, antiproliferative, proapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antiepileptic properties, and its effect on improvement in atherogenesis, endothelial dysfunction, glucose metabolism, lipid profile dysfunction, and prevention of hippocampus pyramidal cell loss. In clinical studies, antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antidiabetic properties as well as therapeutic effects on metabolic syndrome, and gastrointestinal, neuronal, cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, and reproductive disorders were found in N. sativa and its constituents.
CONCLUSION: Extensive basic and clinical studies on N. sativa seed powder, oil, extracts (aqueous, ethanolic, and methanolic), and thymoquinone showed valuable therapeutic effects on different disorders with a wide range of safe doses. However, there were some confounding factors in the reviewed clinical trials, and a few of them presented data about the phytochemical composition of the plant. Therefore, a more standard clinical trial with N. sativa supplementation is needed for the plant to be used as an inexpensive potential biological adjuvant therapy.},

We found that GM-MØ undergo biochemical, morphological and functional modifications in response to NAM, whereas M-MØ were hardly affected. GM-MØ exposed to NAM acquired an M-MØ-like structure while the LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and COX-derived eicosanoids were down-regulated. In contrast, NAM had no effect on the production of IL-10 or the cytochrome P450-derived eicosanoids. Administration of NAM enhanced intracellular NAD concentrations; however, it did not prevent the LPS-mediated drain on NAD pools. In search of intracellular molecular targets of NAM known to be involved in LPS-induced cytokine and eicosanoid synthesis, we found NF-κB activity to be diminished. In conclusion, our data show that vitamin B3, when present during the differentiation of monocytes into GM-MØ, interferes with biochemical pathways resulting in strongly reduced pro-inflammatory features.},

	doi = {10.3945/ajcn.115.126706},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), metabolites produced through the microbial fermentation of nondigestible dietary components, have key roles in energy homeostasis. Animal research suggests that colon-derived SCFAs modulate feeding behavior via central mechanisms. In humans, increased colonic production of the SCFA propionate acutely reduces energy intake. However, evidence of an effect of colonic propionate on the human brain or reward-based eating behavior is currently unavailable.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effect of increased colonic propionate production on brain anticipatory reward responses during food picture evaluation. We hypothesized that elevated colonic propionate would reduce both reward responses and ad libitum energy intake via stimulation of anorexigenic gut hormone secretion.
DESIGN: In a randomized crossover design, 20 healthy nonobese men completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) food picture evaluation task after consumption of control inulin or inulin-propionate ester, a unique dietary compound that selectively augments colonic propionate production. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal was measured in a priori brain regions involved in reward processing, including the caudate, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, anterior insula, and orbitofrontal cortex (n = 18 had analyzable fMRI data).
RESULTS: Increasing colonic propionate production reduced BOLD signal during food picture evaluation in the caudate and nucleus accumbens. In the caudate, the reduction in BOLD signal was driven specifically by a lowering of the response to high-energy food. These central effects were partnered with a decrease in subjective appeal of high-energy food pictures and reduced energy intake during an ad libitum meal. These observations were not related to changes in blood peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucose, or insulin concentrations.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that colonic propionate production may play an important role in attenuating reward-based eating behavior via striatal pathways, independent of changes in plasma PYY and GLP-1. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00750438.},

Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis was performed to identify the major components present in the RE. The clinical signs, biochemistry, immunoblot, ELISA and histology in colon tissues were assessed in order to elucidate the beneficial effect of RE. RE suppressed the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production and the expressions of inflammatory proteins in macrophages. Administration of RE (50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) also significantly reduced the severity of DSS-induced murine colitis, as assessed by the clinical symptoms, colon length and histology. RE administration prevented the DSS-induced activation of p38, ERK and JNK MAPKs, attenuated IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-κB (p65). RE also suppressed the COX-2 and iNOS expressions, decreased the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines and the myeloperoxidase activity in the colon tissue. Histological observation revealed that RE administration alleviated mucosal damage and inflammatory cell infiltration induced by DSS in the colon tissue.

We aimed to assess the association between CVD risk and β-cryptoxanthin in Japan, where Satsuma mandarin, a major source of β-cryptoxanthin, is widely consumed.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This was part of the Mikkabi cohort study. Surveys were conducted at baseline, in 2003 and 2005, and on follow-up in 2006, 2009, and 2013. We examined brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) with a high cut-off value set at 18.3 m s(-1). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals for high baPWV were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model with adjustment for potential confounders. A total of 635 participants with baPWV of less than 18.3 m s(-1) at baseline were included in the analysis. During the follow-up period of 57,921 person-months, 99 subjects developed high baPWV. After multivariate adjustment, the HR for high baPWV in the highest tertile compared with the lowest tertile was significantly low for β-cryptoxanthin, β-carotene, and total carotenoids. Serum concentrations of β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene were higher in people who ate Satsuma mandarin frequently. Compared with {\textless}1/d intake of Satsuma mandarin, 3-4/d was associated with a low risk of high PWV.
CONCLUSION: This study indicated that β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene derived from Satsuma mandarin are candidate micronutrients for preventing arteriosclerosis development. Further longitudinal and interventional studies will be required to validate the effect on CVD.},

The bioavailability, form and in vivo concentrations of these metabolites require to be established.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight healthy volunteers consumed a test meal containing a recommended dose (40 g) and high dose (120 g) of ready-to-eat wheat bran cereal and the systemic and colonic metabolites determined quantitatively by LC-MS.
CONCLUSION: Analysis of the systemic metabolomes demonstrated that a wide range of phytophenols were absorbed/excreted (43 metabolites) within 5 h of consumption. These included 16 of the 21 major parent compounds identified in the intervention product and several of these were also found to be significantly increased in the colon. Not all of the metabolites were increased with the higher dose, suggesting some limitation in absorption due to intrinsic factors and/or the food matrix. Many compounds identified (e.g. ferulic acid and major metabolites) exhibit anti-inflammatory activity and impact on redox pathways. The combination of postprandial absorption and delivery to the colon, as well as hepatic recycling of the metabolites at these concentrations, is likely to be beneficial to both systemic and gut health.},

Consumption of ACE showed safety regarding markers pertaining to anticoagulant activity and platelet activation status, in conjunction with rapid and robust relief of chronic pain.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the food in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. The trial was conducted in subjects aged between 30 and 60 years whose rate of salivary sIgA release was moderately low.

The data obtained with 54 eligible subjects (n=28 and 26 for placebo and active, respectively) were analyzed for efficacy. The rates of salivary sIgA release in the active food group (35.9±84.6 and 47.9±123.4 µg/min at weeks 4 and 8 of intake; changes from pretrial value) were higher compared to the respective rates in the placebo food group (-12.3±72.1 and -3.2±85.9 µg/min, P=0.028 and 0.082, respectively). These findings indicate that intake of black-vinegar-mash-garlic-containing food enhanced the intraoral immune response. There was no adverse event associated with the intake of active food.},

NaB induced the activation of CREB in hippocampal neurons via protein kinase A (PKA), which was responsible for the upregulation of plasticity-related molecules. Finally, spatial memory consolidation-induced activation of CREB and expression of different plasticity-related molecules were less in the hippocampus of poor learning mice as compared to good learning ones. However, oral treatment of cinnamon and NaB increased spatial memory consolidation-induced activation of CREB and expression of plasticity-related molecules in the hippocampus of poor-learning mice and converted poor learners into good learners.

We therefore evaluated the association between use of these non-vitamin, non-mineral supplements and risk of CRC in two prospective cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Regular use of glucosamine and chondroitin was first assessed in 2002 and participants were followed until 2010, over which time 672 CRC cases occurred. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) within each cohort, and results were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. Associations were comparable across cohorts, with a RR of 0.79 (95\% CI: 0.63-1.00) observed for any use of glucosamine and a RR of 0.77 (95\% CI: 0.59-1.01) observed for any use of chondroitin. Use of glucosamine in the absence of chondroitin was not associated with risk of CRC, whereas use of glucosamine + chondroitin was significantly associated with risk (RR: 0.77; 95\% CI: 0.58-0.999). The association between use of glucosamine + chondroitin and risk of CRC did not change markedly when accounting for change in exposure status over follow-up (RR: 0.75; 95\% CI: 0.58-0.96), nor did the association significantly vary by sex, aspirin use, body mass index, or physical activity. The association was comparable for cancers of the colon and rectum. Results support a protective association between use of glucosamine and chondroitin and risk of CRC.

Rats were administered LO at usual therapeutic dose (5 mg/kg) in humans, and following collection of the venous blood from the heart and extraction of total RNA, the differentially expressed genes were screened using a 4 × 44-K whole-genome rat chip (Agilent microarray platform; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) in conjunction with a two-color dye-swap approach. A total of 834 differentially expressed genes in the blood were identified: 362 up-regulated and 472 down-regulated. These genes were functionally categorized using bioinformatics tools. The gene expression inventory of rat blood transcriptome under LO, a first report, has been deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE67499.

	abstract = {AIMS: Several dietary compounds that are able to induce the brown fat-like phenotype in white adipocytes have been considered for treatment of obesity due to their ability to increase energy expenditure. Here, we report that limonene induces the brown fat-like phenotype in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by increasing expression of brown adipocyte-specific genes and proteins.
MAIN METHODS: Limonene-induced browning in white adipocytes was investigated by determining expression levels of brown fat-specific genes and proteins by real-time RT-PCR, immunoblot analysis, and immunocytochemical staining.
KEY FINDINGS: Limonene enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, as evidenced by increased mitochondrial content and immunofluorescent intensity. Limonene also significantly elevated protein levels of HSL, PLIN, p-AMPK, p-ACC, ACO, COX4, CPT1, and CYT C, suggesting its possible role in enhancement of lipolysis and lipid catabolism. Increased expression of PRDM16, UCP1, C/EBPβ, and other brown fat-specific markers by limonene was possibly mediated by activation of β3-adnergenic receptor (β3-AR), as inhibition of β3-AR inhibited up-regulation of brown fat-specific markers. Similarly, limonene-mediated activation of ERK and up-regulation of key brown adipocyte specific markers were eliminated by treatment with ERK antagonist.
SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, these results suggest that limonene induces browning of 3T3-L1 adipocytes via activation of β3-AR and the ERK signaling pathway. In conclusion, our findings suggest that limonene plays a dual modulatory role in induction of the brown adipocyte-like phenotype as well as promotion of lipid metabolism and thus may have potential therapeutic implications for treatment of obesity.},

Here, we show that curcumin induces browning of 3T3-L1 and primary white adipocytes via enhanced expression of brown fat-specific genes. Curcumin-induced browning in white adipocytes was investigated by determining expression levels of brown adipocyte-specific genes/proteins by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot analysis and immunocytochemical staining. Curcumin increased mitochondrial biogenesis, as evidenced by transmission electronic microscopic detection and enhanced expression of proteins involved in fat oxidation. Cucurmin also increased protein levels of hormone-sensitive lipase and p-acyl-CoA carboxylase, suggesting its possible role in augmentation of lipolysis and suppression of lipogenesis. Increased expression of UCP1 and other brown adipocyte-specific markers was possibly mediated by curcumin-induced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) based on the fact that inhibition of AMPK by dorsomorphin abolished expression of PRDM16, UCP1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-alpha while the activator 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide elevated expression of these brown marker proteins.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Not much is known about the relations of circulating saturated fatty acids (SFAs), which are influenced by both metabolic and dietary determinants, with total and cause-specific mortality.
OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of plasma phospholipid SFAs with total and cause-specific mortality among 3941 older adults from the Cardiovascular Health Study, a population-based prospective study of adults aged â‰¥65 y who were followed from 1992 through 2011.
METHODS: The relations of total and cause-specific mortality with plasma phospholipid palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), arachidic acid (20:0), behenic acid (22:0), and lignoceric acid (24:0) were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: During 45,450 person-years of follow-up, 3134 deaths occurred. Higher concentrations of the plasma phospholipid SFAs 18:0, 22:0, and 24:0 were associated with a lower risk of total mortality [multivariable-adjusted HRs (95\% CIs)] for the top compared with the bottom quintile: 0.85 (0.75, 0.95) for 18:0; 0.85 (0.75, 0.95) for 22:0; and 0.80 (0.71, 0.90) for 24:0. In contrast, plasma 16:0 concentrations in the highest quintile were associated with a higher risk of total mortality compared with concentrations in the lowest quintile [1.25 (1.11, 1.41)]. We also found no association of plasma phospholipid 20:0 with total mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the associations of plasma phospholipid SFAs with the risk of death differ according to SFA chain length and support future studies to better characterize the determinants of circulating SFAs and to explore the mechanisms underlying these relations.},

	abstract = {SCOPE: Nutritional interventions based on the use of natural bioactive compounds might offer new possibilities for reshaping obesity-associated bacterial dysregulation or dysbiosis and improving health. We evaluated whether pterostilbene supplementation could induce changes in gut microbiota composition and whether these modifications were associated with improvements in metabolic variables.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Zucker (fa/fa) rats were given a standard diet supplemented (n = 10) or not (n = 9) with pterostilbene (15 mg/kg body weight/day) by oral gavage for 6 weeks. Faucal samples at the beginning and at the end of the intervention period were analyzed by Illumina Mi-Seq sequencing approach. Pterostilbene exerted protective antiobesity effects, improved metabolic function (insulin sensitivity), and induced structural changes in gut microbiota composition. A decrease in the levels of Firmicutes and an increase in Verrucomicrobia phyla were detected in the pterostilbene-treated group. Bacterial species belonging to genera Akkermansia and Odoribacter were also increased. A strong inverse correlation between Akkermansia muciniphila and body weight was evidenced. Odoribacter splanchnicus showed a negative correlation with adiposity.
CONCLUSION: Pterostilbene modifies intestinal bacteria composition toward a healthier microbial profile and suggests that the antiobesity effects induced in Zucker rats could be associated with an enrichment of the mucin-degrading bacterial members, namely Akkermansia and Odoribacter genus.},

This evidence has kindled interest into research on bioactive food components and has till date resulted in the identification of many compounds with cancer preventive and therapeutic potential. Among such compounds is fisetin (3,7,3,4-tetrahydroxyflavone), a flavonol that is commonly found in many fruits and vegetables such as apples, persimmons, grapes, kiwis, strawberries, onions and cucumbers. Fisetin has been shown to inhibit or retard the growth of various cancer cells in culture and implanted tumors in vivo. Fisetin targets many components of intracellular signaling pathways including regulators of cell survival and apoptosis, tumor angiogenic and metastatic switches by modulating a distinct set of upstream kinases, transcription factors and their regulators. Current evidence supports the idea that fisetin is a promising agent for cancer treatment. This review summarizes reported anticancer effects of fisetin, and re-emphasizes its potential therapeutic role in the treatment of cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two brown-like adipocytes, including classical brown adipocytes from brown adipose tissues and beige cells from white adipose tissues, regulate thermogenesis. The developmental and functional induction of brown-like cells provides a defense against obesity and associated metabolic diseases. Our previous study suggests dietary luteolin can improve diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice. Here we further elucidated the action of the natural flavonoid on energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis.
METHODS: Five-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were fed low-fat diet (LFD), high-fat diet (HFD) and HFD supplemented with 0.01\% luteolin. After 12 weeks, their energy expenditure were detected using a combined indirect calorimetry system. Moreover, thermogenic program and associated molecular regulators were assessed in adipose tissues. In another independent study, even-aged mice were fed LFD and luteolin-containing LFD for 12 weeks, and their energy expenditure and thermogenic program were also investigated. Finally, differentiated primary brown and subcutaneous adipocytes were used to identify the critical participation of AMPK/PGC1α signaling in luteolin-regulated browning and thermogenesis.
RESULTS: In mice fed either HFD or LFD, dietary luteolin supplement increased oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and respiratory exchange ratio. The enhancement in energy expenditure was accompanied by the upregulation of thermogenic genes in brown and subcutaneous adipose tissues. Meanwhile, several important AMPK/PGC1α signaling molecules were activated by dietary luteolin in the tissues. Further, luteolin treatment directly elevated thermogenic gene expressions and activated AMPK/PGC1α signaling in differentiated primary brown and subcutaneous adipocytes, whereas AMPK inhibitor Compound C reversed the efficiencies.
CONCLUSIONS: Dietary luteolin activated browning and thermogenesis through an AMPK/PGC1α pathway-mediated mechanism.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Aging is associated with elevated blood pressure (peripheral and aortic; BP) and aortic augmentation index (AIx) which may contribute to aortic BP. Although inorganic nitrate consumption reduces peripheral BP in both young and older adults, the effects of nitrate consumption on aortic BP and wave reflection in young and older adults is unknown. Therefore, we sought to characterize the effects of nitrate consumption on aortic BP and AIx in young and older adults.
METHODS: Noninvasive aortic pressure waveforms were synthesized from high-fidelity radial pressure waveforms via applanation tonometry before and following (60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min) consumption of a nitrate-rich beetroot juice in 26 healthy adults (young: 25 ± 4 years, n = 14; older: 64 ± 5 years, n = 12). Aortic BP and indices of aortic wave reflection (AIx and AIx normalized for heart rate; AIx@75bpm) were calculated from the generated aortic pressure waveform.
RESULTS: Nitrate consumption increased plasma nitrite in both groups 60-180 min following beetroot consumption (P {\textless} 0.001). Nitrate consumption reduced peripheral and aortic BP in both young and older adults (P {\textless} 0.05), with the change being similar between age groups. Conversely, indices of aortic wave reflection were reduced only in young adults following nitrate consumption (range of change from baseline over time: AIx@75bpm, -4.3 to -8.8\%, P {\textless} 0.05), whereas aortic AIx remained unchanged in the older adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that acute dietary nitrate supplementation reduces peripheral and aortic BP similarly in young and older adults despite differential effects on aortic AIx between age groups.},

Cinnamaldehyde showed to have many pharmacological activities indicating anti-diabetic, cognitive enhancer, antiinflammatory etc. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of cinnamaldehyde (CA) on diabetes-induced cognitive deficits.
METHODS: Diabetes was induced in Sprague Dawley rats using high fat diet followed by streptozotocin (35mg/kg, i.p.). High fat diet feeding was continued for 18 week after STZ administration. CA was administered daily during the last 3 weeks (week 16-18) at a doses of 10, 20 and 40mg/kg (p.o.). Animals were subjected to behavioral tests during 18th week. Neurotransmitter levels (glutamate and GABA), acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity and inflammatory markers (TNF-α and IL-6) were assessed in the hippocampus and cortex.
RESULTS: Vehicle-treated diabetic rats showed impaired behavior in open field, elevated plus maze and water maze test compared to age-matched control rats. Cinnamaldehyde showed significant reduction in blood glucose levels at dose of 20 and 40mg/kg. Three weeks treatments of cinnamaldehyde showed significant amelioration of behavioral deficits in diabetic rats. Chronic treatment with cinnamaldehyde showed improvement in brain ChE activity, neurotransmitter levels and reduction in IL-6 and TNF-α levels.
CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that treatment with cinnamaldehyde reverse neuroinflammation and changes in neurotransmitter levels, and consequently improves behavioral deficits in diabetic rats.},

	abstract = {Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a significant cause of morbidity after surgery, especially for the elderly. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that neuroinflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of POCD. Thus, we hypothesized that berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid with anti-inflammatory effects, could improve surgery-induced cognitive impairment. Twenty-month-old male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to exploratory laparotomy with isoflurane anesthesia to mimic the clinical human abdominal surgery. For the interventional studies, mice received berberine (10mg/kg) or vehicle intraperitoneally. For the in vitro study, we examined the effects of berberine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory mediators by cultured BV2 cells. Behavioral tests, expressions of IBA1, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-6 were performed at the indicated time points. In the present study, we showed that surgery impaired the contextual fear memory, as evidenced by the significantly decreased freezing time to the context. This behavioral change coincided with marked increases in IBA1, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus only at 24h but not 7 d after surgery. In BV2 cells, LPS induced significantly increased TNF-α and IL-1β expressions. Notably, berberine treatment rescued surgery-induced cognitive impairment and inhibited the release of IBA1, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the hippocampus. In line with the in vivo study, berberine treatment suppressed LPS-stimulated production of TNF-α and IL-1β in BV2 cells. In conclusion, our study suggests that berberine could alleviate POCD by suppressing neuroinflammation in aged mice.},

	abstract = {Berberine, an isoquinoline plant alkaloid, exhibits a wide range of biochemical and pharmacological effects. However, the precise mechanism of these bioactivities remains poorly understood. In this study, we found significant similarity between berberine and two epigenetic modulators (CG-1521 and TSA). Reverse-docking using berberine as a ligand identified lysine-N-methyltransferase as a putative target of berberine. These findings suggested the potential role of berberine in epigenetic modulation. The results of PCR array analysis of epigenetic chromatin modification enzymes supported our hypothesis. Furthermore, the analysis showed that enzymes involved in histone acetylation and methylation were predominantly affected by treatment with berberine. Up-regulation of histone acetyltransferase CREBBP and EP300, histone deacetylase SIRT3, histone demethylase KDM6A as well as histone methyltransferase SETD7, and down-regulation of histone acetyltransferase HDAC8, histone methyltransferase WHSC1I, WHSC1II and SMYD3, in addition to 38 genes from histone clusters 1-3 were observed in berberine-treated cells using real-time PCR. In parallel, western blotting analyses revealed that the expression of H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 proteins decreased with berberine treatment. These results were further confirmed in acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) cell lines HL-60/ADR and KG1-Î±.

Although the immunomodulatory effects of some herbs have been extensively studied, research related to possible immunomodulatory effects of many herbs and various spices is relatively scarce. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of Nigella sativa, also known as black seed or black cumin, and its major active ingredient, thymoquinone (TQ). This review article focuses on analyzing in vitro and in vivo experimental findings that were reported with regard to the ability of N. sativa and TQ to modulate inflammation, cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses, and Th1/Th2 paradigm. The reported capability of N. sativa to augment the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells against cancer cells is also emphasized. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying such immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of N. sativa and TQ are highlighted. Moreover, the signal transduction pathways implicated in the immunoregulatory functions of N. sativa and TQ are underscored. Experimental evidence suggests that N. sativa extracts and TQ can potentially be employed in the development of effective therapeutic agents towards the regulation of immune reactions implicated in various infectious and non-infectious conditions including different types of allergy, autoimmunity, and cancer.},

	abstract = {The incidence of food hypersensitivity and food allergies is on the rise and new treatment approaches are needed. We investigated whether N. sativa, one of its components, thymoquinone, or synthetic opioid receptor (OR)-agonists can alleviate food allergy. Hence, ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized BALB/c-mice were pre-treated either with a hexanic N. sativa seed extract, thymoquinone, kappa-(U50'4889) or mu-OR-agonists (DAMGO) and subsequently challenged intra-gastrically with OVA. All 4 treatments significantly decreased clinical scores of OVA-induced diarrhea. N. sativa seed extract, thymoquinone, and U50'488 also decreased intestinal mast cell numbers and plasma mouse mast cell protease-1 (MMCP-1). DAMGO, in contrast, had no effect on mast cell parameters but decreased IFNÎ³, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 concentration after ex vivo re-stimulation of mesenteric lymphocytes. The effects on allergy symptoms were reversible by OR-antagonist pre-treatment, whereas most of the effects on immunological parameter were not. We demonstrate that N. sativa seed extract significantly improves symptoms and immune parameters in murine OVA-induced allergic diarrhea; this effect is at least partially mediated by thymoquinone. ORs may also be involved and could be a new target for intestinal allergy symptom alleviation. N. sativa seed extract seems to be a promising candidate for nutritional interventions in humans with food allergy.},

The plant's mechanism of action is still largely unknown. Due to the lack of study data on its efficacy in allergies, four studies on the clinical efficacy of Nigella sativa in allergic diseases are presented. In these studies, a total of 152 patients with allergic diseases (allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, atopic eczema) were treated with Nigella sativa oil, given in capsules at a dose of 40 to 80 mg/kg/day. The patients scored the subjective severity of target symptoms using a predefined scale. The following laboratory parameters were investigated: IgE, eosinophil count, endogenous cortisol in plasma and urine, ACTH, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol and lymphocyte subpopulations. The score of subjective feeling decreased over the course of treatment with black seed oil in all four studies. A slight decrease in plasma triglycerides and a discrete increase in HDL cholesterol occurred while the lymphocyte subpopulations, endogenous cortisol levels and ACTH release remained unchanged. Black seed oil therefore proved to be an effective adjuvant for the treatment of allergic diseases.},

Originally, N. sativa was used to treat migraines and allergy, and researches have shown its effectiveness in destroying cancer cells as well. The gastro protective effect of NS oil and its constituents has also been reported earlier; however, the complete perception on etiology and pathogenesis of gastric ulcer is not yet clear. Herein, we attempt to unveil some of the potential mechanisms exhibited by NS in preventing problems related to gastric ulcers. Gastric ailments like ulcers and tumors are the most common disorders of the gastro-intestinal tract in the present day life of the industrialized world. Gastric ulcer being a multifaceted problem exhibits complex etiology and is the fourth most common cause of cancer mortality. Drug interactions and toxicity are the main hindrances in chemotherapy. The existing merits and demerits of modern-day drugs make us turn toward the plant kingdom which may provide a valuable resource of novel potent natural compounds for pharmaceuticals or alternately, as dietary supplements. In this context, the revered phytotherapeutic N. sativa comes as a promising savior in today's times.

	abstract = {Cinnamon bark is commonly used in traditional Japanese herbal medicines (Kampo medicines). The coumarin contained in cinnamon is known to be hepatotoxic, and a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.1 mg/kg/day, has been quantified and used in Europe to insure safety. Risk assessments for hepatotoxicity by the cinnamon contained in foods have been reported. However, no such assessment of cinnamon bark has been reported and the coumarin content of Kampo medicines derived from cinnamon bark is not yet known. To assess the risk for hepatotoxicity by Kampo medicines, we evaluated the daily coumarin intake of patients who were prescribed Kampo medicines and investigated the relation between hepatotoxicity and the coumarin intake. The clinical data of 129 outpatients (18 male and 111 female, median age 58 years) who had been prescribed keishibukuryogankayokuinin (TJ-125) between April 2008 and March 2013 was retrospectively investigated. Concurrent Kampo medicines and liver function were also surveyed. In addition to TJ-125, the patients took some of the other 32 Kampo preparations and 22 decoctions that include cinnamon bark. The coumarin content of these Kampo medicines was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). TJ-125 had the highest daily content of coumarin (5.63 mg/day), calculated from the daily cinnamon bark dosage reported in the information leaflet inserted in each package of Kampo medicine. The coumarin content in 1g cinnamon bark decoction was 3.0 mg. The daily coumarin intake of the patients was 0.113 (0.049-0.541) mg/kg/day, with 98 patients (76.0\%) exceeding the TDI. Twenty-three patients had an abnormal change in liver function test value, but no significant difference was found in the incidence of abnormal change between the group consuming less than the TDI value (6/31, 19.4\%) and the group consuming equal to or greater than the TDI value (17/98, 17.3\%). In addition, no abnormal change related to cinnamon bark was found for individual patients. This paper was done to assess the risk of hepatotoxicity by the coumarin contained in Kampo medicines and to clarify whether or not the Kampo preparations in general use that contain cinnamon bark may be safely used in clinical practice.},

METHODS: Red ginseng and vitamin C were treated to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-infected BCBL-1, and administrated to Gulo(-/-) mice, which are incapable of synthesizing vitamin C, with or without influenza A virus/H1N1 infection.
KEY FINDINGS: Red ginseng and vitamin C increased the expression of CD25 and CD69 of PBMCs and natural killer (NK) cells. Co-treatment of them decreased cell viability and lytic gene expression in BCBL-1. In Gulo(-/-) mice, red ginseng and vitamin C increased the expression of NKp46, a natural cytotoxic receptor of NK cells and interferon (IFN)-Î³ production. Influenza infection decreased the survival rate, and increased inflammation and viral plaque accumulation in the lungs of vitamin C-depleted Gulo(-/-) mice, which were remarkably reduced by red ginseng and vitamin C supplementation.
CONCLUSIONS: Administration of red ginseng and vitamin C enhanced the activation of immune cells like T and NK cells, and repressed the progress of viral lytic cycle. It also reduced lung inflammation caused by viral infection, which consequently increased the survival rate.},

	abstract = {Several lines of evidence suggest that brain function and behaviour are influenced by microbial metabolites. Key products of the microbiota are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including butyric acid. Butyrate is a functionally versatile molecule that is produced in the mammalian gut by fermentation of dietary fibre and is enriched in butter and other dairy products. Butyrate along with other fermentation-derived SCFAs (e.g. acetate, propionate) and the structurally related ketone bodies (e.g. acetoacetate and d-β-hydroxybutyrate) show promising effects in various diseases including obesity, diabetes, inflammatory (bowel) diseases, and colorectal cancer as well as neurological disorders. Indeed, it is clear that host energy metabolism and immune functions critically depend on butyrate as a potent regulator, highlighting butyrate as a key mediator of host-microbe crosstalk. In addition to specific receptors (GPR43/FFAR2; GPR41/FFAR3; GPR109a/HCAR2) and transporters (MCT1/SLC16A1; SMCT1/SLC5A8), its effects are mediated by utilisation as an energy source via the β-oxidation pathway and as an inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), promoting histone acetylation and stimulation of gene expression in host cells. The latter has also led to the use of butyrate as an experimental drug in models for neurological disorders ranging from depression to neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive impairment. Here we provide a critical review of the literature on butyrate and its effects on multiple aspects of host physiology with a focus on brain function and behaviour. We find fundamental differences in natural butyrate at physiological concentrations and its use as a neuropharmacological agent at rather high, supraphysiological doses in brain research. Finally, we hypothesise that butyrate and other volatile SCFAs produced by microbes may be involved in regulating the impact of the microbiome on behaviour including social communication.},

	abstract = {Microglial cells are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), recognized as key elements in the regulation of neural homeostasis and the response to injury and repair. As excessive activation of microglia may lead to neurodegeneration, therapeutic strategies targeting its inhibition were shown to improve treatment of most neurodegenerative diseases. Benfotiamine is a synthetic vitamin B1 (thiamine) derivate exerting potentially anti-inflammatory effects. Despite the encouraging results regarding benfotiamine potential to alleviate diabetic microangiopathy, neuropathy and other oxidative stress-induced pathological conditions, its activities and cellular mechanisms during microglial activation have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory effects of benfotiamine were investigated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine BV-2 microglia. We determined that benfotiamine remodels activated microglia to acquire the shape that is characteristic of non-stimulated BV-2 cells. In addition, benfotiamine significantly decreased production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NO; cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70), tumor necrosis factor alpha α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), whereas it increased anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) production in LPS stimulated BV-2 microglia. Moreover, benfotiamine suppressed the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and protein kinase B Akt/PKB. Treatment with specific inhibitors revealed that benfotiamine-mediated suppression of NO production was via JNK1/2 and Akt pathway, while the cytokine suppression includes ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and Akt pathways. Finally, the potentially protective effect is mediated by the suppression of translocation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) in the nucleus. Therefore, benfotiamine may have therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases by inhibiting inflammatory mediators and enhancing anti-inflammatory factor production in activated microglia.},

Activated microglia acquires proinflammatory cellular profile that generates oxidative burst. Their persistent activation exacerbates inflammation, which damages healthy neurons via cytotoxic mediators, such as superoxide radical anion and nitric oxide. In our recent study, we have shown that benfotiamine (S-benzoylthiamine O-monophosphate) possesses anti-inflammatory effects. Here, the effects of benfotiamine on the pro-oxidative component of activity of LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells were investigated. The activation of microglia was accompanied by upregulation of intracellular antioxidative defense, which was further promoted in the presence of benfotiamine. Namely, activated microglia exposed to non-cytotoxic doses of benfotiamine showed increased levels and activities of hydrogen peroxide- and superoxide-removing enzymes-catalase and glutathione system, and superoxide dismutase. In addition, benfotiamine showed the capacity to directly scavenge superoxide radical anion. As a consequence, benfotiamine suppressed the activation of microglia and provoked a decrease in NO and (Â·)O(-) 2 production and lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, benfotiamine might silence pro-oxidative activity of microglia to alleviate/prevent oxidative damage of neighboring CNS cells.},

We adjusted effects on incident changes in happiness and life satisfaction for people’s changing incomes and personal circumstances.Results. Increased fruit and vegetable consumption was predictive of increased happiness, life satisfaction, and well-being. They were up to 0.24 life-satisfaction points (for an increase of 8 portions a day), which is equal in size to the psychological gain of moving from unemployment to employment. Improvements occurred within 24 months.Conclusions. People’s motivation to eat healthy food is weakened by the fact that physical health benefits accrue decades later, but well-being improvements from increased consumption of fruit and vegetables are closer to immediate.Policy implications. Citizens could be shown evidence that “happiness” gains from healthy eating can occur quickly and many years before enhanced physical health.},

RESULTS: Probiotic consumption significantly reduced body weight by 0.59 kg (95\% CI, 0.30-0.87) and BMI by 0.49 kg/m(2) (95\% CI, 0.24-0.74). A greater reduction in BMI was found with multiple species of probiotics. Subgroup analysis of trials with intervention duration ≥8 weeks found a more significant reduction in BMI. Limiting analysis to trials with a baseline BMI ≥25 kg/m(2) showed a greater reduction in BMI.
CONCLUSION: Consuming probiotics could reduce body weight and BMI, with a potentially greater effect when multiple species of probiotics were consumed, the duration of intervention was ≥8 weeks, or the objects were overweight.},

All randomized controlled trials published in English on PubMed and Scopus from 2000 to 2014 were systematically searched. Using the PEDro scale to assess the quality of studies, a total of 15 studies with 788 subjects were selected for inclusion in the analysis. The mean difference and effect size with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) were extracted from individual studies. Statistically significant pooled effects of probiotics were found on reduction of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and inflammatory markers. Subgroup analysis revealed statistically significant effects of probiotics on total cholesterol and LDL when the medium was fermented milk or yogurt (P {\textless} 0.001) compared to capsule form, consumption was at least 8 weeks in duration (P {\textless} 0.001), and the probiotics consisted of multiple strains (P {\textless} 0.001) rather than a single strain. A significant reduction was found in LDL in trials which contained Lactobacillus Acidophilus strain (P {\textless} 0.001) compared to other types of strains. Our findings suggest that probiotic supplementation use is effective in lowering the lipid level and coexisting factors associated with cardiovascular disease.},

Traditionally, walnuts have been known for their lipid profile, which has been linked to a wide array of biological properties and health-promoting effects. In addition to essential fatty acids, walnuts contain a variety of other bioactive compounds, such as vitamin E and polyphenols. Among common foods and beverages, walnuts represent one of the most important sources of polyphenols, hence their effect over human health warrants attention. The main polyphenol in walnuts is pedunculagin, an ellagitannin. After consumption, ellagitannins are hydrolyzed to release ellagic acid, which is converted by gut microflora to urolithin A and other derivatives such as urolithins B, C, and D. Ellagitannins possess well known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bioactivity, and several studies have assessed the potential role of ellagitannins against disease initiation and progression, including cancer, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases. The purpose of this review is to summarize current available information relating to the potential effect of walnut polyphenols in health maintenance and disease prevention.},

Researchers have identified biochemicals, including n-3 (ω-3) fatty acids, tocopherols, β-sitosterol, and pedunculagin, that are found in walnuts and that have cancer-prevention properties. Mouse studies in which walnuts were added to the diet have shown the following compared with the control diet: (1) the walnut-containing diet inhibited the growth rate of human breast cancers implanted in nude mice by ∼80\%; (2) the walnut-containing diet reduced the number of mammary gland tumors by ∼60\% in a transgenic mouse model; (3) the reduction in mammary gland tumors was greater with whole walnuts than with a diet containing the same amount of n-3 fatty acids, supporting the idea that multiple components in walnuts additively or synergistically contribute to cancer suppression; and (4) walnuts slowed the growth of prostate, colon, and renal cancers by antiproliferative and antiangiogenic mechanisms. Cell studies have aided in the identification of the active components in walnuts and of their mechanisms of action. This review summarizes these studies and presents the notion that walnuts may be included as a cancer-preventive choice in a healthy diet.},

	abstract = {Because of the combination of population growth and population aging, increases in the incidence of chronic neurodegenerative disorders have become a societal concern, both in terms of decreased quality of life and increased financial burden. Clinical manifestation of many of these disorders takes years, with the initiation of mild cognitive symptoms leading to behavioral problems, dementia and loss of motor functions, the need for assisted living, and eventual death. Lifestyle factors greatly affect the progression of cognitive decline, with high-risk behaviors including unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and exposure to environmental toxins leading to enhanced oxidative stress and inflammation. Although there exists an urgent need to develop effective treatments for age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease, prevention strategies have been underdeveloped. Primary prevention in many of these neurodegenerative diseases could be achieved earlier in life by consuming a healthy diet, rich in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phytochemicals, which offers one of the most effective and least expensive ways to address the crisis. English walnuts (Juglans regia L.) are rich in numerous phytochemicals, including high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and offer potential benefits to brain health. Polyphenolic compounds found in walnuts not only reduce the oxidant and inflammatory load on brain cells but also improve interneuronal signaling, increase neurogenesis, and enhance sequestration of insoluble toxic protein aggregates. Evidence for the beneficial effects of consuming a walnut-rich diet is reviewed in this article.},

The report also addresses the supporting evidence for the health benefit of other tree nuts and selected legumes. Compared to most other nuts, which contain monounsaturated fatty acids, walnuts are unique because they are rich in n-6 (linoleate) and n-3 (linolenate) polyunsaturated fatty acids. Walnuts contain multiple health-beneficial components, such as having a low lysine:arginine ratio and high levels of arginine, folate, fiber, tannins, and polyphenols. Though walnuts are energy rich, clinical dietary intervention studies show that walnut consumption does not cause a net gain in body weight when eaten as a replacement food. Five controlled, peer-reviewed, human clinical walnut intervention trials, involving approximately 200 subjects representative of the 51\% of the adult population in the United States at risk of coronary heart disease were reviewed. The intervention trials consistently demonstrated walnuts as part of a heart-healthy diet, lower blood cholesterol concentrations. None of these studies were of extended duration that would be essential for evaluation of the sustainability of the observed outcomes. These results were supported by several large prospective observational studies in humans, all demonstrating a dose response-related inverse association of the relative risk of coronary heart disease with the frequent daily consumption of small amounts of nuts, including walnuts.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—A total of 71,346 female nurses aged 38–63 years who were free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes in 1984 were followed for 18 years, and dietary information was collected using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire every 4 years. Diagnosis of diabetes was self-reported.
RESULTS—During follow-up, 4,529 cases of diabetes were documented, and the cumulative incidence of diabetes was 7.4\%. An increase of three servings/day in total fruit and vegetable consumption was not associated with development of diabetes (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio 0.99 [95\% CI 0.94–1.05]), whereas the same increase in whole fruit consumption was associated with a lower hazard of diabetes (0.82 [0.72–0.94]). An increase of 1 serving/day in green leafy vegetable consumption was associated with a modestly lower hazard of diabetes (0.91 [0.84–0.98]), whereas the same change in fruit juice intake was associated with an increased hazard of diabetes (1.18 [1.10–1.26]).
CONCLUSIONS—Consumption of green leafy vegetables and fruit was associated with a lower hazard of diabetes, whereas consumption of fruit juices may be associated with an increased hazard among women.},

Brachial artery blood flow was assessed using ultrasound at baseline and 30 min post-ingestion (30minPI). Three treadmill runs to exhaustion were performed at 90\%, 100\%, and 110\% PV. Blood flow was assessed immediately after each exercise bout and 30 min postexercise (30minPEx). After a 7-10 day washout, participants repeated the same procedures, ingesting the opposite supplement. Separate repeated measures ANOVAs were performed for blood flow, vessel diameter, and time to exhaustion (TTE). Blood flow was significantly augmented (p = 0.033) 30minPI with PE in comparison with PL. Vessel diameter was significantly larger (p = 0.036) 30minPEx with PE. Ingestion of PE was found to significantly augment TTE at 90\% (p = 0.009) and 100\% PV (p = 0.027). Acute ingestion of PE 30 min before exercise may enhance vessel diameter and blood flow and delay fatigue during exercise.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ellagitannin supplementation from Wonderful variety pomegranate extract (POMx) improved recovery of skeletal muscle strength after eccentric exercise.
METHODS: Recreationally active males were randomized into a crossover design with either pomegranate extract (POMx) or placebo (PLA), each given during a period of 9 d.To produce delayed-onset muscle soreness, subjects performed two sets of 20 maximal eccentric elbow flexion exercises with one arm.Maximal isometric elbow flexion strength and muscle soreness as well as serum measures of creatine kinase, myoglobin, interleukin 6, and C-reactive protein were made at baseline and 2, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after exercise.
RESULTS: With both treatments, strength was similarly reduced 2 h after exercise (i.e., 72\% of baseline), and recovery of strength was incomplete after 96 h (i.e., 91\% of baseline).However, strength was significantly higher in POMx compared with that in PLA at 48 h (85.4\% +/- 2.5\% and 78.3\% +/- 2.6\%, P = 0.01) and 72 h (88.9\% +/- 2.0\% and 84.0\% +/- 2.0\%, P = 0.009) after exercise. Serum markers of inflammation and muscle damage did not provide insight regarding possible mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with ellagitannins from pomegranate extract significantly improves recovery of isometric strength 2-3 d after a damaging eccentric exercise.},

	abstract = {Urges to eat are influenced by stimuli in the environment that are associated with food (food cues). Obese people are more sensitive to food cues, reporting stronger craving and consuming larger portions after food cue exposure. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediates cue-triggered motivational responses, and activations in the NAc triggered by food cues are stronger in people who are susceptible to obesity. This has led to the idea that alterations in NAc function similar to those underlying drug addiction may contribute to obesity, particularly in obesity-susceptible individuals. Motivational responses are mediated in part by NAc AMPA receptor (AMPAR) transmission, and recent work shows that cue-triggered motivation is enhanced in obesity-susceptible rats after 'junk-food' diet consumption. Therefore, here we determined whether NAc AMPAR expression and function is increased by 'junk-food' diet consumption in obesity-susceptible vs -resistant populations using both outbred and selectively bred models of susceptibility. In addition, cocaine-induced locomotor activity was used as a general 'read out' of mesolimbic function after 'junk-food' consumption. We found a sensitized locomotor response to cocaine in rats that gained weight on a 'junk-food' diet, consistent with greater responsivity of mesolimbic circuits in obesity-susceptible groups. In addition, eating 'junk-food' increased NAc calcium-permeable-AMPAR (CP-AMPAR) function only in obesity-susceptible rats. This increase occurred rapidly, persisted for weeks after 'junk-food' consumption ceased, and preceded the development of obesity. These data are considered in light of enhanced cue-triggered motivation and striatal function in obesity-susceptible rats and the role of NAc CP-AMPARs in enhanced motivation and addiction.},

Therefore, mild dehydration was produced by intermittent moderate exercise without hyperthermia and its effects on cognitive function of women were investigated. Twenty-five females (age 23.0 ± 0.6 y) participated in three 8-h, placebo-controlled experiments involving a different hydration state each day: exercise-induced dehydration with no diuretic (DN), exercise-induced dehydration plus diuretic (DD; furosemide, 40 mg), and euhydration (EU). Cognitive performance, mood, and symptoms of dehydration were assessed during each experiment, 3 times at rest and during each of 3 exercise sessions. The DN and DD trials in which a volunteer attained a ≥1\% level of dehydration were pooled and compared to that volunteer's equivalent EU trials. Mean dehydration achieved during these DN and DD trials was -1.36 ± 0.16\% of body mass. Significant adverse effects of dehydration were present at rest and during exercise for vigor-activity, fatigue-inertia, and total mood disturbance scores of the Profile of Mood States and for task difficulty, concentration, and headache as assessed by questionnaire. Most aspects of cognitive performance were not affected by dehydration. Serum osmolality, a marker of hydration, was greater in the mean of the dehydrated trials in which a ≥1\% level of dehydration was achieved (P = 0.006) compared to EU. In conclusion, degraded mood, increased perception of task difficulty, lower concentration, and headache symptoms resulted from 1.36\% dehydration in females. Increased emphasis on optimal hydration is warranted, especially during and after moderate exercise.},

Its downregulation has been associated with elastic fibers repair loss in aging aorta, lung, ligament, and skin. Several evidences of LOXL1 epigenetic silencing by promoter methylation were reported in cancer and cutis laxa syndrome. We hypothesized that this mechanism could be implicated in skin aging process, as far as elastic fibers are also concerned. Anti-DNMT3A chromatin immunoprecipitation was conducted with nuclear extracts from skin fibroblasts isolated from young and elderly individuals, and showed a higher level of DNMT3A protein binding to the LOXL1 promoter in older cells concomitantly to the decrease of LOXL1 mRNA expression and the increase of LOXL1 promoter methylation. Using luciferase reporter assay driven by LOXL1 promoter in HEK293 cells, we demonstrated that LOXL1 transcriptional activity was dramatically reduced when a recombinant DNMT3A was concomitantly overexpressed. LOXL1 promoter transcriptional activity was restored in the presence of a broad-spectrum inhibitor of DNMT activity, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Finally, to assess whether the interplay between DNMT3A and LOXL1 promoter could be targeted to increase LOXL1 mRNA expression level, an Origanum majorana extract was selected among 43 plant extracts as a new inhibitor of human DNMT3A activity to restore LOXL1 secretion without cytotoxicity in aged skin fibroblasts.},

It is activated by oxidative stress and a number of exogenous compounds, one of which is tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), a widely used food preservative. Nrf2 modulates immune responses in numerous rodent models of inflammation, but its effects on human immune cells are not well characterized. The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the effects of the Nrf2 activator tBHQ on early events of T cell activation in primary human cells. Treatment with tBHQ induced mRNA expression of the Nrf2 target genes HMOX-1, GCLC, and NQO1, and also increased NRF2 mRNA expression, albeit to a lesser extent than the other target genes. tBHQ decreased production of the cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ at both the protein and mRNA levels after stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and to an even greater extent in isolated CD4 T cells. Likewise, tBHQ decreased induction of CD25 and CD69 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and this decrease was even more marked in isolated CD4 T cells. In addition, tBHQ inhibited induction of NFκB DNA binding in anti-CD3/anti-CD28-activated PBMCs. Collectively, these data suggest that tBHQ inhibits activation of primary human CD4 T cells, which correlates with activation of Nrf2 and inhibition of NFκB DNA binding. Although these studies suggest the food additive tBHQ negatively impacts T cell activation, further studies will be needed to fully elucidate the effect of tBHQ on human immune responses.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: l-theanine, an amino acid uniquely contained in green tea (Camellia sinensis), has been suggested to have various psychotropic effects. This study aimed to examine whether l-theanine is effective for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in an open-label clinical trial.
METHODS: Subjects were 20 patients with MDD (four males; mean age: 41.0±14.1 years, 16 females; 42.9±12.0 years). l-theanine (250 mg/day) was added to the current medication of each participant for 8 weeks. Symptoms and cognitive functions were assessed at baseline, 4, and 8 weeks after l-theanine administration by the 21-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Stroop test, and Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS).
RESULTS: HAMD-21 score was reduced after l-theanine administration (p=0.007). This reduction was observed in unremitted patients (HAMD-21{\textgreater}7; p=0.004) at baseline. Anxiety-trait scores decreased after l-theanine administration (p=0.012) in the STAI test. PSQI scores also decreased after l-theanine administration (p=0.030) in the unremitted patients at baseline. Regarding cognitive functions, response latency (p=0.001) and error rate (p=0.036) decreased in the Stroop test, and verbal memory (p=0.005) and executive function (p=0.016) were enhanced in the BACS test after l-theanine administration.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that chronic (8-week) l-theanine administration is safe and has multiple beneficial effects on depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbance and cognitive impairments in patients with MDD. However, since this is an open-label study, placebo-controlled studies are required to consolidate the effects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tocotrienols (TCTs) are more potent antioxidants than α-tocopherol (TOC). However, the effectiveness and mechanism of the action of TCT isomers as anti-atherosclerotic agents in stimulated human endothelial cells under inflammatory conditions are not well established.
AIMS: 1) To compare the effects of different TCT isomers on inflammation, endothelial activation, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). 2) To identify the two most potent TCT isomers in stimulated human endothelial cells. 3) To investigate the effects of TCT isomers on NFκB activation, and protein and gene expression levels in stimulated human endothelial cells.
METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were incubated with various concentrations of TCT isomers or α-TOC (0.3-10 µM), together with lipopolysaccharides for 16 h. Supernatant cells were collected and measured for protein and gene expression of cytokines (interleukin-6, or IL-6; tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or TNF-α), adhesion molecules (intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, or ICAM-1; vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, or VCAM-1; and e-selectin), eNOS, and NFκB.
RESULTS: δ-TCT is the most potent TCT isomer in the inhibition of IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and NFκB, and it is the second potent in inhibiting e-selectin and eNOS. γ-TCT isomer is the most potent isomer in inhibiting e-selectin and eNOS, and it is the second most potent in inhibiting is IL-6, VCAM-1, and NFκB. For ICAM-1 protein expression, the most potent is δ-TCT followed by α-TCT. α- and β-TCT inhibit IL-6 at the highest concentration (10 µM) but enhance IL-6 at lower concentrations. γ-TCT markedly increases eNOS expression by 8-11-fold at higher concentrations (5-10 µM) but exhibits neutral effects at lower concentrations.
CONCLUSION: δ- and γ-TCT are the two most potent TCT isomers in terms of the inhibition of inflammation and endothelial activation whilst enhancing eNOS, possibly mediated via the NFκB pathway. Hence, there is a great potential for TCT isomers as anti-atherosclerotic agents.},

This study examined the hypothesis that sweetened beverage consumption is positively associated with risk of BTC in a prospective study.
METHODS: The study population comprised 70 832 Swedish adults (55.9\% men, age 45-83 years) from the Swedish Mammography Cohort and Cohort of Swedish Men who were free of cancer and diabetes and completed a food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Incident BTC case patients were ascertained through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to analyze the data. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 13.4 years, 127 extrahepatic BTC case patients (including 71 gallbladder cancers) and 21 intrahepatic BTC case patients were ascertained. After adjustment for other risk factors, women and men in the highest category of combined sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened beverage consumption had a statistically significantly increased risk of extrahepatic BTC and gallbladder cancer. The multivariable hazard ratios for two or more servings per day (200 mL/serving) of sweetened beverages compared with no consumption were 1.79 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02 to 3.13) for extrahepatic BTC and 2.24 (95\% CI = 1.02 to 4.89) for gallbladder cancer. The corresponding hazard ratio for intrahepatic BTC was 1.69 (95\% CI = 0.41 to 7.03).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that high consumption of sweetened beverages may increase the risk of BTC, particularly gallbladder cancer.},

Therefore, from a pomegranate extract (PE), previously reported by our group to have anti-AD effects in vivo, 21 constituents, which were primarily ellagitannins, were isolated and identified (by HPLC, NMR, and HRESIMS). In silico computational studies, used to predict blood-brain barrier permeability, revealed that none of the PE constituents, but the urolithins, fulfilled criteria required for penetration. Urolithins prevented β-amyloid fibrillation in vitro and methyl-urolithin B (3-methoxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one), but not PE or its predominant ellagitannins, had a protective effect in Caenorhabditis elegans post induction of amyloid β(1-42) induced neurotoxicity and paralysis.

However, very few nuts have been investigated to date, and no information is available regarding the ME of walnuts.
OBJECTIVE: A study was conducted to determine the ME of walnuts when consumed as part of a typical American diet.
METHODS: Healthy adults (n = 18; mean age = 53.1 y; body mass index = 28.8 kg/m(2)) participated in a randomized crossover study with 2 treatment periods (3 wk each). The study was a fully controlled dietary feeding intervention in which the same base diet was consumed during each treatment period; the base diet was unsupplemented during one feeding period and supplemented with 42 g walnuts/d during the other feeding period. Base diet foods were reduced in equal proportions during the walnut period to achieve isocaloric food intake during the 2 periods. After a 9 d diet acclimation period, subjects collected all urine and feces for âˆ¼1 wk (as marked by a Brilliant Blue fecal collection marker) for analysis of energy content. Administered diets, walnuts, and fecal and urine samples were subjected to bomb calorimetry, and the resulting data were used to calculate the ME of the walnuts.
RESULTS: One 28-g serving of walnuts contained 146 kcal (5.22 kcal/g), 39 kcal/serving less than the calculated value of 185 kcal/serving (6.61 kcal/g). The ME of the walnuts was 21\% less than that predicted by the Atwater factors (P {\textless} 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Consistent with other tree nuts, Atwater factors overestimate the metabolizable energy value of walnuts. These results could help explain the observations that consumers of nuts do not gain excessive weight and could improve the accuracy of food labeling. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01832909.},

	abstract = {Dietary restriction (DR) is a dietary regimen that extends lifespan in many organisms. One mechanism contributing to the conserved effect of DR on longevity is the cellular recycling process autophagy, which is induced in response to nutrient scarcity and increases sequestration of cytosolic material into double-membrane autophagosomes for degradation in the lysosome. Although autophagy plays a direct role in DR-mediated lifespan extension in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the contribution of autophagy in individual tissues remains unclear. In this study, we show a critical role for autophagy in the intestine, a major metabolic tissue, to ensure lifespan extension of dietary-restricted eat-2 mutants. The intestine of eat-2 mutants has an enlarged lysosomal compartment and flux assays indicate increased turnover of autophagosomes, consistent with an induction of autophagy in this tissue. This increase in intestinal autophagy may underlie the improved intestinal integrity we observe in eat-2 mutants, since whole-body and intestinal-specific inhibition of autophagy in eat-2 mutants greatly impairs the intestinal barrier function. Interestingly, intestinal-specific inhibition of autophagy in eat-2 mutants leads to a decrease in motility with age, alluding to a potential cell non-autonomous role for autophagy in the intestine. Collectively, these results highlight important functions for autophagy in the intestine of dietary-restricted C. elegans.},

A majority of suicidal and homicidal violence involves males; homicidal violence is prevalent among young men and suicide is the leading cause of violence worldwide. Lithium, in pharmacological doses, has been used successfully for decades in treating bipolar disorders, and has been shown to decrease violent crime in this situation. Interestingly, lithium, in trace amounts, as occurs in some drinking water, has been inversely related to aggression, and suicidal and homicidal violence. Lithium is naturally found in vegetables, grains and drinking water, and dietary intake varies from nearly zero to 3mg daily. Elemental lithium, in trace doses, has been shown to improve mood in weeks. Moreover, lithium, in trace amounts, has no toxicity. In order to ensure adequate dietary intakes of elemental lithium daily for the purpose of decreasing aggression and violence, we propose considering the fortification of cereal grain products with lithium and also the addition of lithium to vitamin preparations for adults. Importantly, randomized trials in various populations are needed to test this hypothesis.},

	issn = {0163-4984},
	abstract = {Using data for 27 Texas counties from 1978-1987, it is shown that the incidence rates of suicide, homicide, and rape are significantly higher in counties whose drinking water supplies contain little or no lithium than in counties with water lithium levels ranging from 70-170 micrograms/L; the differences remain statistically significant (p less than 0.01) after corrections for population density. The corresponding associations with the incidence rates of robbery, burglary, and theft were statistically significant with p less than 0.05. These results suggest that lithium has moderating effects on suicidal and violent criminal behavior at levels that may be encountered in municipal water supplies. Comparisons of drinking water lithium levels, in the respective Texas counties, with the incidences of arrests for possession of opium, cocaine, and their derivatives (morphine, heroin, and codeine) from 1981-1986 also produced statistically significant inverse associations, whereas no significant or consistent associations were observed with the reported arrest rates for possession of marijuana, driving under the influence of alcohol, and drunkenness. These results suggest that lithium at low dosage levels has a generally beneficial effect on human behavior, which may be associated with the functions of lithium as a nutritionally-essential trace element. Subject to confirmation by controlled experiments with high-risk populations, increasing the human lithium intakes by supplementation, or the lithiation of drinking water is suggested as a possible means of crime, suicide, and drug-dependency reduction at the individual and community level.},

The purpose of the study reported here was to test the validity of our observation that assaultive young males have elevated blood copper/zinc (Cu/Zn) ratios when compared to a control group of young males with no history of assaultive behavior. All male patients between the ages of 3 years and 20 years who made a first visit to the outpatient Pfeiffer Treatment Center in Naperville, Ill., during a two-month period were evaluated. Based on interviews with patients and their families and application of a standardized behavior scale, 135 assaultive young males and 18 controls with no history of assaultive behavior were identified. Blood samples were collected from test subjects and controls and analyzed for serum copper and plasma zinc concentrations by an independent laboratory using atomic absorption methods. The median Cu/Zn ratio for the assaultive subjects was 1.40 compared to 1.02 for controls, a statistically significant difference (t = 5.94; p {\textless} 0.01).},

Here we show that lithium, a drug approved for human use, promotes longevity and healthspan. We demonstrate that lithium extends lifespan in female and male Drosophila, when administered throughout adulthood or only later in life. The life-extending mechanism involves the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF-2). Combining genetic loss of the NRF-2 repressor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) with lithium treatment revealed that high levels of NRF-2 activation conferred stress resistance, while low levels additionally promoted longevity. The discovery of GSK-3 as a therapeutic target for aging will likely lead to more effective treatments that can modulate mammalian aging and further improve health in later life.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Lithium is a nutritionally essential trace element predominantly contained in vegetables, plant-derived foods, and drinking water. Environmental lithium exposure and concurrent nutritional intake vary considerably in different regions. We here have analyzed the possibility that low-dose lithium exposure may affect mortality in both metazoans and mammals.
METHODS: Based on a large Japanese observational cohort, we have used weighted regression analysis to identify putative effects of tap water-derived lithium uptake on overall mortality. Independently, we have exposed Caenorhabditis elegans, a small roundworm commonly used for anti-aging studies, to comparable concentrations of lithium, and have quantified mortality during this intervention.
RESULTS: In humans, we find here an inverse correlation between drinking water lithium concentrations and all-cause mortality in 18 neighboring Japanese municipalities with a total of 1,206,174 individuals (Î² = -0.661, p = 0.003). Consistently, we find that exposure to a comparably low concentration of lithium chloride extends life span of C. elegans (p = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings indicate that long-term low-dose exposure to lithium may exert anti-aging capabilities and unambiguously decreases mortality in evolutionary distinct species.},

	abstract = {Lithium has been a valuable treatment for bipolar affective disorders for decades. Clinical use of lithium, however, has been problematic due to its narrow therapeutic index and concerns for its toxicity in various organ systems. Renal side effects associated with lithium include polyuria, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, proteinuria, distal renal tubular acidosis, and reduction in glomerular filtration rate. Histologically, chronic lithium nephrotoxicity is characterized by interstitial nephritis with microcyst formation and occasional focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Nevertheless, this type of toxicity is uncommon, with the strongest risk factors being high serum levels of lithium and longer time on lithium therapy. In contrast, in experimental models of acute kidney injury and glomerular disease, lithium has antiproteinuric, kidney protective, and reparative effects. This paradox may be partially explained by lower lithium doses and short duration of therapy. While long-term exposure to higher psychiatric doses of lithium may be nephrotoxic, short-term low dose of lithium may be beneficial and ameliorate kidney and podocyte injury. Mechanistically, lithium targets glycogen synthase kinase-3Î², a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine protein kinase implicated in the processes of tissue injury, repair, and regeneration in multiple organ systems, including the kidney. Future studies are warranted to discover the exact "kidney-protective dose" of lithium and test the effects of low-dose lithium on acute and chronic kidney disease in humans.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Lithium is an essential treatment in bipolar disorder and treatment-resistant depression; however, its use has been limited by concerns regarding its renal adverse effects. An improved understanding of potential molecular mechanisms can help develop prevention and treatment strategies for lithium-associated renal disease.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search using MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychINFO including English-language original research articles published prior to November 2015 that specifically investigated lithium's effects on nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), using molecular markers.
RESULTS: From a total of 3510 records, 71 pre-clinical studies and two relevant clinical studies were identified. Molecular alterations were reported in calcium signaling, inositol monophosphate, extracellular-regulated, prostaglandin, sodium/solute transport, G-protein-coupled receptors, nitric oxide, vasopressin/aquaporin, and inflammation-related pathways in lithium-associated renal disease. The majority of studies found that these mechanisms were implicated in NDI, while few studies had examined CKD.
DISCUSSION: Future studies will have to focus on (1) validating the present findings in human subjects and (2) examining CKD, which is the most clinically relevant lithium-associated renal effect. This will improve our understanding of lithium's biological effects, as well as inform a personalized medicine approach, which could lead to safer lithium prescribing and less renal adverse events.},

Although the mechanisms underlying the lithium-induced renal pathologies are becoming clearer, several recent animal studies revealed that short-term administration of lower amounts of lithium prevents different forms of experimental AKI. In this review, we discuss the knowledge of the pathologic and therapeutic effects of lithium in the kidney. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying mechanisms of these seemingly paradoxical effects of lithium, in which fine-tuned regulation of glycogen synthase kinase type 3, a prime target for lithium, seems to be key. The new discoveries regarding the protective effect of lithium against AKI in rodents call for follow-up studies in humans and suggest that long-term therapy with low lithium concentrations could be beneficial in CKD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The effect of lycopene-containing foods in prostate cancer development remains undetermined. We tested whether a lycopene-rich tomato intervention could reduce the levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer patients.
METHODS: Prior to their curative treatment, 79 patients with prostate cancer were randomized to a nutritional intervention with either 1) tomato products containing 30 mg lycopene per day; 2) tomato products plus selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, soy isoflavones, grape/pomegranate juice, and green/black tea (tomato-plus); or 3) control diet for 3 weeks.
RESULTS: The main analysis, which included patients in all risk categories, did not reveal differences in changes of PSA-values between the intervention and control groups. Post-hoc, exploratory analyses within intermediate risk (n = 41) patients based on tumor classification and Gleason score post-surgery, revealed that median PSA decreased significantly in the tomato group as compared to controls (-2.9\% and +6.5\% respectively, p = 0.016). In separate post-hoc analyses, we observed that median PSA-values decreased by 1\% in patients with the highest increases in plasma lycopene, selenium and C20:5 n-3 fatty acid, compared to an 8.5\% increase in the patients with the lowest increase in lycopene, selenium and C20:5 n-3 fatty acid (p = 0.003). Also, PSA decreased in patients with the highest increase in lycopene alone (p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: Three week nutritional interventions with tomato-products alone or in combination with selenium and n-3 fatty acids lower PSA in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer. Our observation suggests that the effect may depend on both aggressiveness of the disease and the blood levels of lycopene, selenium and omega-3 fatty acids.},

A flexible machine learning framework, Venn machine (VM) was introduced to make probabilistic predictions for each prediction. Three Venn predictors were developed based on three classical probabilistic prediction methods (Platt's method, Softmax regression and Naive Bayes). Three Venn predictors and three classical probabilistic prediction methods were compared in aspect of classification rate and especially the validity of estimated probability. A best classification rate of 88.57\% was achieved with Platt's method in offline mode, and the classification rate of VM-SVM (Venn machine based on Support Vector Machine) was 86.35\%, just 2.22\% lower. The validity of Venn predictors performed better than that of corresponding classical probabilistic prediction methods. The validity of VM-SVM was superior to the other methods. The results demonstrated that Venn machine is a flexible tool to make precise and valid probabilistic prediction in the application of E-nose, and VM-SVM achieved the best performance for the probabilistic prediction of ginseng samples.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Consumption of alcohol mixed with energy drinks (AmED) has been associated with a variety of risks beyond that observed with alcohol alone. Consumers of AmED beverages are more likely to engage in heavy episodic (binge) drinking. This study was to investigate whether the consumption of high caffeine energy drink mixers with alcohol would increase the desire to drink alcohol compared to the same amount of alcohol alone using a double-blind, within-subjects, placebo-controlled study design.
METHODS: Participants (n = 26) of equal gender who were social drinkers attended 6 double-blind dose administration sessions that involved consumption of alcohol and energy drinks, alone and in combination. On each test day, participants received 1 of 6 possible doses: (i) 1.21 ml/kg vodka + 3.63 ml/kg decaffeinated soft drink, (ii) 1.21 ml/kg vodka + 3.63 ml/kg energy drink, (iii) 1.21 ml/kg vodka + 6.05 ml/kg energy drink, (iv) 3.63 ml/kg decaffeinated soft drink, (v) 3.63 ml/kg energy drink, and (vi) 6.05 ml/kg energy drink. Following dose administration, participants repeatedly completed self-reported ratings on the Desire-for-Drug questionnaire and provided breath alcohol readings.
RESULTS: Alcohol alone increased the subjective ratings of "desire for more alcohol" compared to placebo doses. Energy drink mixers with the alcohol increased desire for more alcohol ratings beyond that observed with alcohol alone.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides laboratory evidence that AmED beverages lead to greater desire to drink alcohol versus the same amount of alcohol consumed alone. The findings are consistent with results from animal studies indicating that caffeine increases the rewarding and reinforcing properties of alcohol.},

METHODS: Twenty four rats were assigned to three groups (8 rats for each). Rats of first group were non diabetic and rats of the second group were rendered diabetic by streptozotocin (STZ). Both groups received vehicle, corn oil only (5 ml/kg body weight) and served as negative and positive controls, respectively. Rats of the third group were rendered diabetic and received oral curcumin dissolved in corn oil at a dose of 15 mg/5 ml/kg body weight for 6 weeks.
RESULTS: Diabetic rats showed significant increase of blood glucose, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and activities of all antioxidant enzymes with significant reduction of reduced glutathione (GSH) compare to the control non diabetic group. Gene expression of Bcl2, SOD, CAT, GPX and GST was increased significantly in diabetic untreated rats compare to the control non diabetic group. The administration of curcumin to diabetic rats normalized significantly their blood sugar level and TBARS values and increased the activities of all antioxidant enzymes and GSH concentration. In addition, curcumin treated rats showed significant increase in gene expression of IGF-1, Bcl2, SOD and GST compare to non diabetic and diabetic untreated rats.
CONCLUSION: Curcumin was antidiabetic therapy, induced hypoglycemia by up-regulation of IGF-1 gene and ameliorate the diabetes induced oxidative stress via increasing the availability of GSH, increasing the activities and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes and Bcl2. Further studies are required to investigate the actual mechanism of action of curcumin regarding the up regulation of gene expression of examined parameters.},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between MP, serum concentrations of L and Z, and cognitive function in subjects free of retinal disease with low MP (Group 1, n = 105) and in subjects with AMD (Group 2, n = 121).
METHODS: MP was measured using customized heterochromatic flicker photometry and dual-wavelength autofluorescence; cognitive function was assessed using a battery of validated cognition tests; serum L and Z concentrations were determined by HPLC.
RESULTS: Significant correlations were evident between MP and various measures of cognitive function in both groups (r = -0.273 to 0.261, p≤0.05, for all). Both serum L and Z concentrations correlated significantly (r = 0.187, p≤0.05 and r = 0.197, p≤0.05, respectively) with semantic (animal) fluency cognitive scores in Group 2 (the AMD study group), while serum L concentrations also correlated significantly with Verbal Recognition Memory learning slope scores in the AMD study group (r = 0.200, p = 0.031). Most of the correlations with MP, but not serum L or Z, remained significant after controlling for age, gender, diet, and education level.
CONCLUSION: MP offers potential as a non-invasive clinical biomarker of cognitive health, and appears more successful in this role than serum concentrations of L or Z.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the 2-year effect of multiple doses of lutein/zeaxanthin on serum, macular pigmentation, and visual performance on patients with early age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
METHODS: In this randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial, 112 early AMD patients randomly received either 10 mg lutein, 20 mg lutein, a combination of lutein (10 mg) and zeaxanthin (10 mg), or placebo daily for 2 years. Serum concentration of lutein/zeaxanthin, macular pigment optical density (MPOD), visual functions including best-spectacle corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity (CS), flash recovery time (FRT), and vision-related quality of life (VFQ25) was quantified.
RESULTS: Serum lutein concentration and MPOD significantly increased in all the active treatment groups. Supplementation with 20 mg lutein was the most effective in increasing MPOD and CS at 3 cycles/degree for the first 48 weeks. However, they both significantly increased to the same peak value following supplementation with either 10 mg or 20 mg lutein during the intervention. No statistical changes of BCVA or FRT were observed during the trial.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term lutein supplementation could increase serum lutein concentration, MPOD, and visual sensitivities of early AMD patients. 10 mg lutein daily might be an advisable long-term dosage for early AMD treatment.},

METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of lutein supplementation was conducted in healthy nonsmokers. 117 eligible subjects were randomly assigned to receive 10 or 20 mg/d of lutein or placebo for 12 weeks. Levels of plasma carotenoid concentrations, total antioxidant capacity (TAOC), the lipoprotein profile, and antioxidant enzymes activities were determined at baseline and at 6, and 12 weeks after the initiation of treatment. Biomarkers of oxidative damage to protein and lipids, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were measured at baseline and after supplementation.
RESULTS: Plasma lutein and TAOC significantly increased in both active treatment groups during 12 weeks. A significant reduction was found in malondialdehyde in the 20 mg lutein group. CRP concentration decreased in a dose-dependent manner for lutein supplementation, and there was a significant between-group difference in CRP between the 20 mg lutein and the placebo group. Serum CRP was directly related to the change in plasma lutein and TAOC for both active treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: The results support the possibility that lutein supplementation reduce biomarkers of CVD risk via decreased lipid peroxidation and inflammatory response by increasing plasma lutein concentrations and antioxidant capacity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial examined serum and macular (in vivo measured macular pigment optical density [MPOD]) responses to supplemental lutein and zeaxanthin in Chinese subjects with early age-related macular degeneration.
METHODS: One hundred and eight patients with early age-related macular degeneration older than 50 y were randomized to low lutein (LL; 10 mg/d), high lutein (HL; 20 mg/d), lutein plus zeaxanthin (LZ; each 10 mg/d), or placebo during a 48-wk intervention. Serum concentrations were quantified by C(30) high-performance liquid chromatography (at baseline and 4, 12, 24, and 48 wk), and MPOD was measured by analysis of autofluorescence images (at baseline and 24 and 48 wk).
RESULTS: Serum lutein levels in the LL, LZ, and HL groups increased significantly in the first 4 wk and then increased 4.24-, 4.66-, and 6.23-fold during the trial, respectively (all P {\textless} 0.001). The serum lutein level in the HL group was significantly higher than that in the LL or LZ group at 48 wk (P {\textless} 0.05). Similarly, the serum zeaxanthin concentration in the LZ group increased 3.11-fold at 48 wk. MPOD increased smoothly in all treated groups, and the increase from baseline was greatest in the HL group at 24 and 48 wk (both P {\textless} 0.05). MPOD and serum lutein levels increased linearly with the dosage and their increasing rates were statistically correlated (all P {\textless} 0.05). No notable changes were detected in the placebo group for MPOD and serum concentrations.
CONCLUSION: Xanthophyll supplementation significantly increased serum concentrations and MPOD in patients with early age-related macular degeneration, and a higher lutein supplementation (20 mg/d) might be more effective in increasing these two biochemical markers in Chinese patients without significant side effects.},

Systematic evaluation of the research designs and data provide a basis for risk assessment and the usual tolerable Upper Level of Intake (UL) derived from it if the newer methods described as the Observed Safe Level (OSL) or Highest Observed Intake (HOI) are utilized. The OSL risk assessment method indicates that the evidence of safety is strong at intakes up to 20mg/d for lutein, and 75 mg/d for lycopene, and these levels are identified as the respective OSL. Although much higher levels have been tested without adverse effects and may be safe, the data for intakes above these levels are not sufficient for a confident conclusion of long-term safety.},

	abstract = {Epidemiologic studies suggest that dietary lutein and zeaxanthin may be of benefit in maintaining cognitive health. Among the carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin are the only two that cross the blood-retina barrier to form macular pigment (MP) in the eye. They also preferentially accumulate in the human brain. Lutein and zeaxanthin in macula from nonhuman primates were found to be significantly correlated with their concentrations in matched brain tissue. Therefore, MP can be used as a biomarker of lutein and zeaxanthin in primate brain tissue. This is of interest given that a significant correlation was found between MP density and global cognitive function in healthy older adults. An examination of a relation between cognition and lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations in the brain tissue of decedents from a population-based study in centenarians found that zeaxanthin concentrations in brain tissue were significantly related to antemortem measures of global cognitive function, memory retention, verbal fluency, and dementia severity after adjustment for age, sex, education, hypertension, and diabetes. In univariate analyses, lutein was related to recall and verbal fluency, but the strength of the associations was attenuated with adjustment for covariates. However, lutein concentrations in the brain were significantly lower in individuals with mild cognitive impairment than in those with normal cognitive function. Last, in a 4-mo, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in older women that involved lutein supplementation (12 mg/d), alone or in combination with DHA (800 mg/d), verbal fluency scores improved significantly in the DHA, lutein, and combined-treatment groups. Memory scores and rate of learning improved significantly in the combined-treatment group, who also showed a trend toward more efficient learning. When all of these observations are taken into consideration, the idea that lutein and zeaxanthin can influence cognitive function in older adults warrants further study.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a transgenic retinoic acid response element reporter mouse model (n = 8, per group) for this study, and after the initial wash out of VA using a vitamin A deficient diet (VAD) for 18 weeks, the animals were supplemented further with (a) VAD-fed mice, (b) VAD-fed mice plus retinol (20 mg/kg bw), (c) VAD-fed mice plus β-carotene (40 mg/kg bw), and (d) VAD-fed mice plus lycopene (40 mg/kg bw). Using ex vivo scanning and gene expression analysis of retinoid target and VA marker gene analysis in various organs of these supplemented mice (b, c, d), we found increased luciferase activity and normalized marker and target gene analysis compared to group a.
CONCLUSIONS: Lycopene can restore VA deficiency and compensate VA for retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-mediated signaling as the major function of VA in the mammalian organism. Lycopene administration can initiate upregulation of RAR-mediated signaling in various organs in VAD-fed animals via potential novel bioactive lycopene metabolites. This indicates that lycopene possesses partial pro-VA activity in mice transmitted via RAR-mediated signaling.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is an oxidative stress-mediated degenerative disorder. Elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) is frequently found in the levodopa-treated PD patients, is associated with disease progression and is a marker of oxidative stress. Whey protein is a rich source of cysteine, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). It has been shown that supplementation with Whey protein increases glutathione synthesis and muscle strength.
OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: In this study, we conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind study (NCT01662414) to investigate the effects of undenatured Whey protein isolate supplementation for 6months on plasma glutathione, plasma amino acids, and plasma Hcy in PD patients. Clinical outcome assessments included the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) and striatal L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-(18)F-fluorophenylalanine (FDOPA) uptake were determined before and after supplementation. 15 patients received Whey protein, and 17 received Soy protein, served as a control group.
RESULTS: Significant increases in plasma concentration of reduced glutathione and the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione were found in the Whey-supplemented patients but not in a control group. This was associated with a significant decrease of plasma levels of Hcy. The plasma levels of total glutathione were not significantly changed in either group. Plasma BCAA and essential amino acids (EAA) were significantly increased in the Whey-supplemented group only. The UPDRS and striatal FDOPA uptake in PD patients were not significantly ameliorated in either group. However, significant negative correlation was observed between the UPDRS and plasma BCAA and EAA in the pre-supplemented PD patients.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to report that Whey protein supplementation significantly increases plasma reduced glutathione, the reduced to oxidized glutathione ratio, BCAAs and EAAs in patients with PD, together with a concomitant significant reduction of plasma Hcy. However, there were no significant changes in clinical outcomes. Long-term, large randomized clinical studies are needed to explore the benefits of Whey protein supplementation in the management of PD patients.},

	abstract = {The combination of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous fatty acid amide belonging to the family of the N-acylethanolamines, and the flavonoid luteolin has been found to exert neuroprotective activities in a variety of mouse models of neurological disorders, including brain ischemia. Indirect findings suggest that the two molecules can reduce the activation of mastocytes in brain ischemia, thus modulating crucial cells that trigger the inflammatory cascade. Though, no evidence exists about a direct effect of PEA and luteolin on mast cells in experimental models of brain ischemia, either used separately or in combination. In order to fill this gap, we developed a novel cell-based model of severe brain ischemia consisting of primary mouse cortical neurons and cloned mast cells derived from mouse fetal liver (MC/9 cells) subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). OGD exposure promoted both mast cell degranulation and the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a time-dependent fashion. MC/9 cells exacerbated neuronal damage in neuron-mast cells co-cultures exposed to OGD. Likewise, the conditioned medium derived from OGD-exposed MC/9 cells induced significant neurotoxicity in control primary neurons. PEA and luteolin pre-treatment synergistically prevented the OGD-induced degranulation of mast cells and reduced the neurotoxic potential of MC/9 cells conditioned medium. Finally, the association of the two drugs promoted a direct synergistic neuroprotection even in pure cortical neurons exposed to OGD. In summary, our results indicate that mast cells release neurotoxic factors upon OGD-induced activation. The association PEA-luteolin actively reduces mast cell-mediated neurotoxicity as well as pure neurons susceptibility to OGD.},

However, there is a lack of scientific information about its effectiveness to increase fat metabolism during exercise. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of an acute ingestion of p-synephrine on fat oxidation at rest and during exercise.
METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized and counterbalanced experimental design, 18 healthy subjects performed two acute experimental trials after the ingestion of p-synephrine (3 mg kg(-1) ) or after the ingestion of a placebo (cellulose). Energy expenditure and fat oxidation rates were measured by indirect calorimetry at rest and during a cycle ergometer ramp exercise test (increases of 25 W every 3 min) until volitional fatigue.
RESULTS: In comparison with the placebo, the ingestion of p-synephrine did not change energy consumption (1.6 ± 0.3 vs. 1.6 ± 0.3 kcal min(-1) ; P = 0.69) or fat oxidation rate at rest (0.08 ± 0.02 vs. 0.10 ± 0.04 g min(-1) ; P = 0.15). However, the intake of p-synephrine moved the fat oxidation-exercise intensity curve upwards during the incremental exercise (P {\textless} 0.05) without affecting energy expenditure. Moreover, p-synephrine increased maximal fat oxidation rate (0.29 ± 0.15 vs. 0.40 ± 0.18 g min(-1) ; P = 0.01) during exercise although it did not affect the intensity at which maximal fat oxidation was achieved (55.8 ± 7.7 vs. 56.7 ± 8.2\% VO2peak ; P = 0.51).
CONCLUSIONS: The acute ingestion of p-synephrine increased the fat oxidation rate while it reduced the carbohydrate oxidation rate when exercising at low-to-moderate exercise intensities.},

Results In comparison with the placebo, the ingestion of p-synephrine did not change energy consumption (1.6 ± 0.3 vs. 1.6 ± 0.3 kcal min−1; P = 0.69) or fat oxidation rate at rest (0.08 ± 0.02 vs. 0.10 ± 0.04 g min−1; P = 0.15). However, the intake of p-synephrine moved the fat oxidation–exercise intensity curve upwards during the incremental exercise (P {\textless} 0.05) without affecting energy expenditure. Moreover, p-synephrine increased maximal fat oxidation rate (0.29 ± 0.15 vs. 0.40 ± 0.18 g min−1; P = 0.01) during exercise although it did not affect the intensity at which maximal fat oxidation was achieved (55.8 ± 7.7 vs. 56.7 ± 8.2\% VO2peak; P = 0.51). Conclusions The acute ingestion of p-synephrine increased the fat oxidation rate while it reduced the carbohydrate oxidation rate when exercising at low-to-moderate exercise intensities.},

DESIGN: Cohort study. The duration of follow-up was the interval between the date of interview and the date of death or 31 December 2008, when censored for survivors. Information used included demographics, socio-economic status, health behaviours, cooking frequencies, physical function, cognitive function, nutrition knowledge awareness, eating out habits and food and nutrient intakes. These data were linked to death records. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to evaluate cooking frequency on death from 1999 to 2008 with related covariate adjustments.
SETTING: Elderly Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan, 1999-2000.
SUBJECTS: Nationally representative free-living elderly people aged ≥65 years (n 1888).
RESULTS: During a 10-year follow-up, 695 participants died. Those who cooked most frequently were younger, women, unmarried, less educated, non-drinkers of alcohol, non-smokers, without chewing difficulty, had spouse as dinner companion, normal cognition, who walked or shopped more than twice weekly, who ate less meat and more vegetables. Highly frequent cooking ({\textgreater}5 times/week, compared with never) predicted survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 0·47; 95 \% CI, 0·36, 0·61); with adjustment for physical function, cognitive function, nutrition knowledge awareness and other covariates, HR was 0·59 (95 \% CI, 0·41, 0·86). Women benefited more from cooking more frequently than did men, with decreased HR, 51 \% v. 24 \%, when most was compared with least. A 2-year delay in the assessment of survivorship led to similar findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Cooking behaviour favourably predicts survivorship. Highly frequent cooking may favour women more than men.},

Twenty college athletes (14 males and 6 females) were allocated to two randomly assigned trials. Subjects in the CB group orally ingested capsules that contained CB formulation at a dose of 800 mg per day in two equal doses for 28 days, while subjects in the placebo (P) group ingested an equal number of identical-looking caps that contained cellulose. There were no changes in glucose, cholesterol, and lipoproteins within or between trials (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was significantly higher in the CB versus P trial at the post- supplementation trial (1.66 +/- 0.16 vs. 1.51 +/- 0.05 mmol/L; p {\textless} 0.05). There were no statistically significant changes in average anaerobic power, index of anaerobic fatigue, maximal heart rate, blood lactate, and maximal oxygen uptake within or between trials (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Heart rate recovery (HRR) index increased significantly in CB group as compared with baseline level (38 +/- 4 vs. 32 +/- 5 beats/min; p {\textless} 0.05). Blood lactate after 10 min of recovery (Lact(rec)) significantly decreased in the CB group after supplementation protocol as compared with initial results (7.6 +/- 4.2 vs. 5.5 +/- 2.6 mmol/L; p {\textless} 0.05). No subject reported any side effects from CB or P. The results of the present study indicate that supplementation with a CB formulation slightly increased antioxidant capacity, but there were minimal effects on recovery parameters after exercise in college athletes.},

To study further these effects, mitogen response and some immune parameters were examined in a high mammary tumour strain of SHN mice. While the T-lymphocyte response to concanavalin A was not significantly changed by either CC or CC-W, the lipopolysaccharide response was significantly enhanced by both treatments. The proportion of CD45R/B220+ (B) cells in the splenic lymphocytes was significantly increased by CC, and the percentage of activated (CD25+) cells in B-lymphocytes was increased by CC and CC-W. These data indicate that coffee cherry extract can enhance B-lymphocyte response, and suggest that this immunopotentiation contributes to the antitumourigenic role of coffee cherry.},

	abstract = {The fruit of the coffee plant, Coffea arabica, has high phenolic antioxidant and phytonutrient content and could be a beneficial food ingredient. However, the fruit has historically been discarded for the favored harvesting of the coffee bean alone. CoffeeBerry products are derived from the whole fruit and include a ground whole powder, a water extract, and a more recently developed water-ethanol extract. The safety of CoffeeBerry products was evaluated in three genotoxicity studies, three short-term oral toxicity studies, and a 90-day dietary toxicity study. Bacterial mutagenicity studies and a micronucleus test using murine peripheral cells demonstrated that none of the three products showed mutagenic or genotoxic potential. In the short-term studies, despite palatability issues, female rats showed a tolerance for whole powder and ethanol extract at doses up to 8800 mg/kg bw/day. Male rats also exhibited palatability issues and tolerated lower doses of approximately 4000 mg/kg bw/day ethanol extract via gavage and approximately 2100 mg/kg bw/day whole powder or water extract in the diet. When fed in the diet to Sprague-Dawley rats for 90 days, ethanol extract showed no adverse effects at dietary concentrations of up to 5\% (approximately 3446 and 4087 mg/kg bw/day for male and female rats, respectively).},

Both probiotics and synbiotics are well known ingredients of functional foods and nutraceuticals and may provide beneficial health effects because they can influence the intestinal microbial ecology and immunity. The present study reviews the effects of probiotics and synbiotics on obesity, insulin resistance syndrome (IRS), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in human randomized clinical trials. Select probiotics and synbiotics provided beneficial effects in patients with obesity, mainly affecting the body mass index and fat mass. Some probiotics had beneficial effects on IRS, decreasing the cell adhesion molecule-1 levels, and the synbiotics decreased the insulin resistance and plasma lipid levels. Moreover, select probiotics improved the carbohydrate metabolism, fasting blood glucose, insulin sensitivity and antioxidant status and also reduced metabolic stress in subjects with T2D. Some probiotics and synbiotics improved the liver and metabolic parameters in patients with NAFLD. The oral intake of probiotics and synbiotics as co-adjuvants for the prevention and treatment of obesity, IRS, T2D and NAFLD is partially supported by the data shown in the present review. However, further studies are required to understand the precise mechanism of how probiotics and synbiotics affect these metabolic disorders.},

However, the influence of ω-3 PUFAs on colorectal cancer (CRC) survival is unknown.
Design Within the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we prospectively studied CRC-specific and overall mortality in a cohort of 1659 patients with CRC according to intake of marine ω-3 PUFAs and its change after diagnosis.
Results Higher intake of marine ω-3 PUFAs after CRC diagnosis was associated with lower risk of CRC-specific mortality (p for trend=0.03). Compared with patients who consumed {\textless}0.10 g/day of marine ω-3 PUFAs, those consuming at least 0.30 g/day had an adjusted HR for CRC-specific mortality of 0.59 (95\% CI 0.35 to 1.01). Patients who increased their marine ω-3 PUFA intake by at least 0.15 g/day after diagnosis had an HR of 0.30 (95\% CI 0.14 to 0.64, p for trend {\textless}0.001) for CRC deaths, compared with those who did not change or changed their intake by {\textless}0.02 g/day. No association was found between postdiagnostic marine ω-3 PUFA intake and all-cause mortality (p for trend=0.47).
Conclusions High marine ω-3 PUFA intake after CRC diagnosis is associated with lower risk of CRC-specific mortality. Increasing consumption of marine ω-3 PUFAs after diagnosis may confer additional benefits to patients with CRC.},

Literature searches were conducted in Pubmed, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Only randomized controlled trials were included. In total, 38 studies were included: 25 in animals and 15 in humans (2 studies were conducted in both). Most studies used Bifidobacterium (eg, B. longum, B. breve , and B. infantis ) and Lactobacillus (eg, L. helveticus , and L. rhamnosus ), with doses between 10⁸ and 10¹⁰ colony-forming units for 2 weeks in animals and 4 weeks in humans. These probiotics showed efficacy in improving psychiatric disorder-related behaviors including anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, and memory abilities, including spatial and non-spatial memory. Because many of the basic science studies showed some efficacy of probiotics on central nervous system function, this background may guide and promote further preclinical and clinical studies. Translating animal studies to human studies has obvious limitations but also suggests possibilities. Here, we provide several suggestions for the translation of animal studies. More experimental designs with both behavioral and neuroimaging measures in healthy volunteers and patients are needed in the future.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Improving hydration is a strategy commonly used by clinicians to prevent overeating with the goal of promoting a healthy weight among patients. The relationship between weight status and hydration, however, is unclear. Our objective was to assess the relationship between inadequate hydration and BMI and inadequate hydration and obesity among adults in the United States.
METHODS: Our study used a nationally representative sample from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009 to 2012, and included adults aged 18 to 64 years. The primary outcome of interest was body mass index (BMI), measured in continuous values and also categorized as obese (BMI â‰¥30) or not (BMI {\textless}30). Individuals with urine osmolality values of 800 mOsm/kg or greater were considered to be inadequately hydrated. Linear and logistic regressions were performed with continuous BMI and obesity status as the outcomes, respectively. Models were adjusted for known confounders including age, race/ethnicity, sex, and income-to-poverty ratio.
RESULTS: In this nationally representative sample (n = 9,528; weighted n = 193.7 million), 50.8\% were women, 64.5\% were non-Hispanic white, and the mean age was 41 years. Mean urine osmolality was 631.4 mOsm/kg (SD = 236.2 mOsm/kg); 32.6\% of the sample was inadequately hydrated. In adjusted models, adults who were inadequately hydrated had higher BMIs (1.32 kg/m(2); 95\% CI, 0.85-1.79; P {\textless}.001) and higher odds of being obese (OR = 1.59; 95\% CI, 1.35-1.88; P {\textless}.001) compared with hydrated adults.
CONCLUSION: We found a significant association between inadequate hydration and elevated BMI and inadequate hydration and obesity, even after controlling for confounders. This relationship has not previously been shown on a population level and suggests that water, an essential nutrient, may deserve greater focus in weight management research and clinical strategies.},

Using a rat model, we aimed to assess the effects of supplementation with oxidized fish oil during pregnancy in mothers and offspring, focusing on newborn viability and maternal insulin sensitivity. Female rats were allocated to a control or high-fat diet and then mated. These rats were subsequently randomized to receive a daily gavage treatment of 1 ml of unoxidized fish oil, a highly oxidized fish oil, or control (water) throughout pregnancy. At birth, the gavage treatment was stopped, but the same maternal diets were fed ad libitum throughout lactation. Supplementation with oxidized fish oil during pregnancy had a marked adverse effect on newborn survival at day 2, leading to much greater odds of mortality than in the control (odds ratio 8.26) and unoxidized fish oil (odds ratio 13.70) groups. In addition, maternal intake of oxidized fish oil during pregnancy led to increased insulin resistance at the time of weaning (3 wks after exposure) compared with control dams (HOMA-IR 2.64 vs. 1.42; P = 0.044).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Emerging evidence suggests that traditional diets and nutrition have a significant impact on brain development, and could contribute to the promotion of mental health and prevention of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Moreover, deficits in parvalbumin (PV)-immunoreactive and/or GABAergic neurons are closely associated with various psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. To investigate the possible neural mechanisms of diet involvement in mental health, we analyzed the effects of dried-bonito dashi (Japanese fish broth) (DBD) on PV-immunoreactive neurons and emotional behaviors in young mice.
METHODS: Male mice after weaning were fed DBD for 60 days, and tested with a resident-intruder test for aggressiveness and a forced swimming test for depression-like symptoms. After the behavioral testing, PV-immunoreactive neurons in the brain were immunohistochemically analyzed.
RESULTS: The results indicated that DBD intake decreased aggressiveness and depression-like symptoms, and increased the densities of PV-immunoreactive neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala, hippocampus, and superior colliculus. These behavioral changes were correlated with the densities of PV-immunoreactive neurons in the mPFC, amygdala, and hippocampus. However, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy did not affect the effects of DBD on emotional behaviors, although it nonspecifically decreased the densities of PV-immunoreactive neurons.
DISCUSSION: The results suggest that DBD might modulate emotional behaviors by promoting PV-immunoreactive and/or GABAergic neuronal activity through parallel routes. The present results highlight a new mechanism for diet involvement in brain functions, and suggest that DBD might have therapeutic potential for the promotion of mental health.},

Two of the major mechanisms of protection offered by lutein and zeaxanthin against age-related blue light damage are the quenching of singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species and the absorption of blue light. Determining the specific reactive intermediate(s) produced by a particular phototoxic ocular chromophore not only defines the mechanism of toxicity but can also later be used as a tool to prevent damage.},

	abstract = {The relationship between lutein and zeaxanthin and visual and cognitive health throughout the lifespan is compelling. There is a variety of evidence to support a role for lutein and zeaxanthin in vision. Lutein's role in cognition has only recently been considered. Lutein and its isomer, zeaxanthin, are taken up selectively into eye tissue. Lutein is the predominant carotenoid in human brain tissue. Lutein and zeaxanthin in neural tissue may have biological effects that include antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and structural actions. In addition, lutein and zeaxanthin may be protective against eye disease because they absorb damaging blue light that enters the eye. In pediatric brains, the relative contribution of lutein to the total carotenoids is twice that found in adults, accounting for more than half the concentration of total carotenoids. The greater proportion of lutein in the pediatric brain suggests a need for lutein during neural development as well. In adults, higher lutein status is related to better cognitive performance, and lutein supplementation improves cognition. The evidence to date warrants further investigation into the role of lutein and zeaxanthin in visual and cognitive health throughout the lifespan.},

Although ALA-DAG increases dietary fat utilization as energy in rodents, its effects in humans are not known. The present study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover intervention trial performed to clarify the effect of ALA-DAG on postprandial energy metabolism in humans. Nineteen healthy subjects participated in this study, and postprandial energy metabolism was evaluated using indirect calorimetry followed by 14-d repeated pre-consumption of TAG (rapeseed oil) as a control or ALA-DAG. As a primary outcome, ALA-DAG induced significantly higher postprandial fat oxidation than TAG. As a secondary outcome, carbohydrate oxidation tended to be decreased. In addition, postprandial energy expenditure was significantly increased by ALA-DAG compared to TAG. These findings suggest that daily ALA-DAG consumption stimulates dietary fat utilization as energy after a meal, as well as greater diet induced thermogenesis in healthy humans. In conclusion, repeated consumption of ALA-DAG enhanced postprandial fat metabolism after a meal, which may partially explain its visceral fat area-reducing effect.},

Curcumin inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas silymarin showed significant inhibition only at the highest concentrations assessed. We found synergistic effects when colon cancer cells were treated with curcumin and silymarin together. The combination treatment led to inhibition of colon cancer cell proliferation and increased apoptosis compared to single compound treated cells. Combination treated cells exhibited marked cell rounding and membrane blebbing of apoptotic cells. Curcumin treated cells showed 3-fold more caspase3/7 activity whereas combination treated cells showed 5-fold more activity compared to control and silymarin treated cells. When DLD-1 cells were pre-exposed to curcumin, followed by treatment with silymarin, the cells underwent a high amount of cell death. The pre-exposure studies indicated curcumin sensitization of silymarin effect. Our results indicate that combinatorial treatments using phytochemicals are effective against colorectal cancer.},

In this study, the effects of American ginseng on chemically induced colitis and colon carcinogenesis were evaluated using an azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse model. During the acute phase on day 15, the oral administration of ginseng (15 and 30 mg/kg/day) significantly suppressed AOM/DSS-induced colitis, as demonstrated by the disease activity index and colon tissue histology. During the chronic phase in week 13, AOM/DSS-induced tumor multiplicity was significantly suppressed by ginseng. Ginseng significantly attenuated the increase of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL1α, IL1β, IL6, G-CSF, and GM-CSF. Serum metabolomics data in the PCA plots showed good separation between the AOM/DSS model and ginseng-treated mice, and the most important endogenous metabolite changes were identified. The 16S rRNA data showed that after AOM/DSS, the microbiome community in the model group was obviously changed, and ginseng inhibited these changes. Fecal metabolomics analysis supported these findings. In conclusion, oral ginseng significantly decreased AOM/DSS-induced colitis and colon carcinogenesis by inhibiting inflammatory cytokines and restoring the metabolomics and microbiota profiles accordingly. Selective endogenous small molecules could be used as biomarkers to elucidate the effects of ginseng treatment. Cancer Prev Res; 9(10); 803-11. ©2016 AACR.},

Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a polyphenolic compound found in high concentration in coffee, is known to possess antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of CGA and its major metabolites in primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons. We show that CGA and caffeic acid displayed a dramatic protective effect against the nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside. In marked contrast, ferulic acid and quinic acid had no protective effect against this nitrosative stress. While CGA and quinic acid had no protective effect against glutamate-induced cell death, caffeic acid and ferulic acid significantly protected neurons from excitotoxicity. Finally, caffeic acid was the only compound to display significant protective activity against hydrogen peroxide, proteasome inhibition, caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. These results indicate that caffeic acid displays a much broader profile of neuroprotection against a diverse range of stressors than its parent polyphenol, CGA, or the other major metabolites, ferulic acid and quinic acid. We conclude that caffeic acid is a promising candidate for testing in pre-clinical models of neurodegeneration.},

Six randomized controlled trials involving 501 patients were included in this study. The results showed that the efficacy of reducing TC, LDL, ALT, 2hPG, and HbA1c in NAFLD patients of the berberine group were significantly higher than that of control group. The subgroup analyses on TG, AST, and FBG indicated that treatment combined with berberine decreased TG level in NAFLD patients significantly.

We assessed the impact of quercetin on BP through a systematic review and meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched PUBMED, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and EMBASE up to January 31, 2015 to identify placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of quercetin on BP. Meta-analysis was performed using either a fixed-effects or random-effect model according to I(2) statistic. Effect size was expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95\% CI. Overall, the impact of quercetin on BP was reported in 7 trials comprising 9 treatment arms (587 patients). The results of the meta-analysis showed significant reductions both in systolic BP (WMD: -3.04 mm Hg, 95\% CI: -5.75, -0.33, P=0.028) and diastolic BP (WMD: -2.63 mm Hg, 95\% CI: -3.26, -2.01, P{\textless}0.001) following supplementation with quercetin. When the studies were categorized according to the quercetin dose, there was a significant systolic BP and diastolic BP-reducing effect in randomized controlled trials with doses ≥500 mg/day (WMD: -4.45 mm Hg, 95\% CI: -7.70, -1.21, P=0.007 and -2.98 mm Hg, 95\% CI: -3.64, -2.31, P{\textless}0.001, respectively), and lack of a significant effect for doses {\textless}500 mg/day (WMD: -1.59 mm Hg, 95\% CI: -4.44, 1.25, P=0.273 and -0.24 mm Hg, 95\% CI: -2.00, 1.52, P=0.788, respectively), but indirect comparison tests failed to significant differences between doses.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant effect of quercetin supplementation in the reduction of BP, possibly limited to, or greater with dosages of {\textgreater}500 mg/day. Further studies are necessary to investigate the clinical relevance of these results and the possibility of quercetin application as an add-on to antihypertensive therapy.},

However, some individuals experience a range of symptoms in response to wheat ingestion, without the characteristic serological or histological evidence of coeliac disease. The aetiology and mechanism of these symptoms are unknown, and no biomarkers have been identified. We aimed to determine if sensitivity to wheat in the absence of coeliac disease is associated with systemic immune activation that may be linked to an enteropathy.
Design Study participants included individuals who reported symptoms in response to wheat intake and in whom coeliac disease and wheat allergy were ruled out, patients with coeliac disease and healthy controls. Sera were analysed for markers of intestinal cell damage and systemic immune response to microbial components.
Results Individuals with wheat sensitivity had significantly increased serum levels of soluble CD14 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein, as well as antibody reactivity to bacterial LPS and flagellin. Circulating levels of fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2), a marker of intestinal epithelial cell damage, were significantly elevated in the affected individuals and correlated with the immune responses to microbial products. There was a significant change towards normalisation of the levels of FABP2 and immune activation markers in a subgroup of individuals with wheat sensitivity who observed a diet excluding wheat and related cereals.

	abstract = {The psychoactive cannabinoids from Cannabis sativa L. and the arachidonic acid-derived endocannabinoids are nonselective natural ligands for cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB(1)) and CB(2) receptors. Although the CB(1) receptor is responsible for the psychomodulatory effects, activation of the CB(2) receptor is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of inflammation, pain, atherosclerosis, and osteoporosis. Here, we report that the widespread plant volatile (E)-beta-caryophyllene [(E)-BCP] selectively binds to the CB(2) receptor (K(i) = 155 +/- 4 nM) and that it is a functional CB(2) agonist. Intriguingly, (E)-BCP is a common constituent of the essential oils of numerous spice and food plants and a major component in Cannabis. Molecular docking simulations have identified a putative binding site of (E)-BCP in the CB(2) receptor, showing ligand pi-pi stacking interactions with residues F117 and W258. Upon binding to the CB(2) receptor, (E)-BCP inhibits adenylate cylcase, leads to intracellular calcium transients and weakly activates the mitogen-activated kinases Erk1/2 and p38 in primary human monocytes. (E)-BCP (500 nM) inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression in peripheral blood and attenuates LPS-stimulated Erk1/2 and JNK1/2 phosphorylation in monocytes. Furthermore, peroral (E)-BCP at 5 mg/kg strongly reduces the carrageenan-induced inflammatory response in wild-type mice but not in mice lacking CB(2) receptors, providing evidence that this natural product exerts cannabimimetic effects in vivo. These results identify (E)-BCP as a functional nonpsychoactive CB(2) receptor ligand in foodstuff and as a macrocyclic antiinflammatory cannabinoid in Cannabis.},

	abstract = {It has been shown that blockade of L-type calcium channels could abolish the development of opioid-induced antinociceptive tolerance. Here, the antitolerant effects of olive leaf extract (OLE) and its main component, oleuropein, which have a calcium channel blocker property were determined. Adult male Wistar rats were injected with morphine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) for 8 days to induce antinociceptive tolerance. Then OLE (50-200 mg/kg i.g.) and oleuropein (1-10 mg/kg i.p.) were injected concomitantly with morphine. The tail-flick test was used to assess the nociceptive threshold. The dorsal half of the lumbar spinal cord was assayed for the expression of L-type calcium channel using semiquantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that OLE (200 mg/kg) completely prevented morphine tolerance development. In addition, oleuropein in dose of 10 mg/kg, but not in 5 mg/kg, prevented the development of morphine antinociceptive tolerance. In addition, a significant increase in the mRNA levels of calcium channel (43.9\%) was observed in the lumbar spinal cord of tolerant animals, which was reversed by effective of dose OLE. In conclusion, the results indicate that olive leaf extract has a potential antitolerant property against the chronic usage of morphine and that its main component, oleuropein, is responsible for such effect.},

More recently, the DASH diet was shown to reduce oxidative stress in hypertensive and nonhypertensive humans. However, the main nutritional components responsible for these beneficial effects of the DASH diet remain unknown. Because the DASH diet is rich in potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and alkali, we performed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to compare effects of potassium magnesium citrate (KMgCit), potassium chloride (KCl), and potassium citrate (KCit) to allow dissociation of the three components of K, Mg, and citrate on 24-hour ambulatory BP and urinary 8-isoprostane in hypertensive and prehypertensive subjects, using a randomized crossover design. We found that KCl supplementation for 4 weeks induced a significant reduction in nighttime SBP compared with placebo (116 ± 12 vs 121 ± 15 mm Hg, respectively, p {\textless}0.01 vs placebo), whereas KMgCit and KCit had no significant effect in the same subjects (118 ± 11 and 119 ± 13 mm Hg, respectively, p {\textgreater}0.1 vs placebo). In contrast, urinary 8-isoprostane was significantly reduced with KMgCit powder compared with placebo (13.5 ± 5.7 vs 21.1 ± 10.5 ng/mgCr, respectively, p {\textless}0.001), whereas KCl and KCit had no effect (21.4 ± 9.1 and 18.3 ± 8.4, respectively, p {\textgreater}0.1 vs placebo). In conclusion, our study demonstrated differential effects of KCl and KMgCit supplementation on BP and the oxidative stress marker in prehypertensive and hypertensive subjects.

METHODS: Forty normal-weight young women were involved in this cross-sectional study. DNA was isolated from white blood cells, and CpG site methylation in TNF-α was analyzed by Sequenom EpiTyper. The quality of the diet was assessed by Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2005).
RESULTS: Contradicting our hypothesis, HEI-2005 score was negatively associated with CpG5 (r = -0.460, p = 0.003) and TNF-α total methylation (r = -0.355, p = 0.026). A higher intake of fruits was related to lower insulin, HOMA-IR, and TNF-α methylation. No other dietary pattern was related to TNF-α methylation. TNF-α total methylation correlated positively with systolic blood pressure (r = 0.323; p = 0.042) and CpG5 methylation with body mass index (r = 0.333, p = 0.036). Furthermore, fiber intake was negatively associated with the CpG5 (r = -0.324, p = 0.041) and TNF-α total methylation (r = -0.434, p = 0.005), whereas vitamin C intake was negatively associated with TNF-α total methylation (r = -0.411, p = 0.009). Intakes of apples and citrus fruits were negatively associated with TNF-α total methylation.
CONCLUSION: A healthy dietary pattern and higher fruit intake (particularly apples and citrus fruits) were related to better glucose tolerance in healthy subjects, which could be mediated by lower TNF-α methylation.},

	abstract = {Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6, ω-3) is a highly polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid. It is concentrated in neuronal brain membranes, for which reason it is also referred to as a "brain food". DHA is essential for brain development and function. It plays an important role in improving antioxidant and cognitive activities of the brain. DHA deficiency occurs during aging and dementia, impairs memory and learning, and promotes age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). For about two decades, we have reported that oral administration of DHA increases spatial memory acquisition, stimulates neurogenesis, and protects against and reverses memory impairment in amyloid β peptide-infused AD rat models by decreasing amyloidogenesis and protects against age-related cognitive decline in the elderly. These results demonstrate a robust link between DHA and cognitive health. Rodents that were fed a diet low in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly those that were DHA-deficient, frequently suffered from anxiety, depression and memory impairment. Although the exact mechanisms of action of DHA in brain functions are still elusive, a host of mechanisms have been proposed. For example, DHA, which inherently has a characteristic three-dimensional structure, increases membrane fluidity, strengthens antioxidant activity and enhances the expression of several proteins that act as substrates for improving memory functions. It reduces the brain amyloid burden and inhibits in vitro fibrillation and amyloid-induced neurotoxicity in cell-culture model. In this review, we discuss how DHA acts as a molecule with diverse functions.},

	doi = {10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.4182},
	abstract = {Importance: Defining what represents a macronutritionally balanced diet remains an open question and a high priority in nutrition research. Although the amount of protein may have specific effects, from a broader dietary perspective, the choice of protein sources will inevitably influence other components of diet and may be a critical determinant for the health outcome.
Objective: To examine the associations of animal and plant protein intake with the risk for mortality.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study of US health care professionals included 131 342 participants from the Nurses' Health Study (1980 to end of follow-up on June 1, 2012) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986 to end of follow-up on January 31, 2012). Animal and plant protein intake was assessed by regularly updated validated food frequency questionnaires. Data were analyzed from June 20, 2014, to January 18, 2016.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality.
Results: Of the 131 342 participants, 85 013 were women (64.7\%) and 46 329 were men (35.3\%) (mean [SD] age, 49 [9] years). The median protein intake, as assessed by percentage of energy, was 14\% for animal protein (5th-95th percentile, 9\%-22\%) and 4\% for plant protein (5th-95th percentile, 2\%-6\%). After adjusting for major lifestyle and dietary risk factors, animal protein intake was not associated with all-cause mortality (HR, 1.02 per 10\% energy increment; 95\% CI, 0.98-1.05; P for trend = .33) but was associated with higher cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.08 per 10\% energy increment; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.16; P for trend = .04). Plant protein was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.90 per 3\% energy increment; 95\% CI, 0.86-0.95; P for trend {\textless} .001) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.88 per 3\% energy increment; 95\% CI, 0.80-0.97; P for trend = .007). These associations were confined to participants with at least 1 unhealthy lifestyle factor based on smoking, heavy alcohol intake, overweight or obesity, and physical inactivity, but not evident among those without any of these risk factors. Replacing animal protein of various origins with plant protein was associated with lower mortality. In particular, the HRs for all-cause mortality were 0.66 (95\% CI, 0.59-0.75) when 3\% of energy from plant protein was substituted for an equivalent amount of protein from processed red meat, 0.88 (95\% CI, 0.84-0.92) from unprocessed red meat, and 0.81 (95\% CI, 0.75-0.88) from egg.
Conclusions and Relevance: High animal protein intake was positively associated with cardiovascular mortality and high plant protein intake was inversely associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, especially among individuals with at least 1 lifestyle risk factor. Substitution of plant protein for animal protein, especially that from processed red meat, was associated with lower mortality, suggesting the importance of protein source.},

Pb acetate (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was administered for 3 d. After 24 h of the last toxicant dose, LA (100 mg/kg, orally [po]) alone or in conjuction with Ca (50 mg/kg, po) and Zn (10 mg/kg, po) was administered for 3 d. Significant alterations in the concentration of urea, uric acid, triglycerides, cholesterol, aspartate amino transferase, alanine amino transferase, lipid peroxidation, and reduced glutathione as well as alterations in enzyme activity of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase were observed following acute Pb exposure. These findings were also supported by elevated mean DNA damage and Pb body burden in blood and soft tissues compared to controls (p ≤ 0.05). Three d posttreatment with LA along with Zn and Ca could significantly restore the biochemical parameters and Pb body burden to near-normal status through antioxidant activity or by preventing bioaccumulation of Pb within the blood and tissues of experimental rats.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Professional voice users, such as singers and teachers, are at greater risk of developing vocal fold injury from excessive use of voice; thus, protection of the vocal fold is essential. One of the most important factors that aggravates injury is the production of reactive oxygen species at the wound site. The purpose of the current study was to assess the effect of astaxanthin, a strong antioxidant, on the protection of the vocal fold from injury and inflammation due to vocal loading.
STUDY DESIGN: This study is an institutional review board-approved human clinical trial.
METHODS: Ten male subjects underwent a 60-minute vocal loading session and received vocal assessments prior to, immediately after, and 30 minutes postvocal loading (AST(-) status). All subjects were then prescribed 24â€‰mg/day of astaxanthin for 28 days, after which they received the same vocal task and assessments (AST(+) status). Phonatory parameters were compared between both groups.
RESULTS: Aerodynamic assessment, acoustic analysis, and GRBAS scale (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, and strain) were significantly worse in the AST(-) status immediately after vocal loading, but improved by 30 minutes after loading. In contrast, none of the phonatory parameters in the AST(+) status were statistically worse, even when measured immediately after vocal loading. No allergic responses or adverse effects were observed after administration of astaxanthin.
CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that astaxanthin can protect the vocal fold from injury and inflammation caused by vocal loading possibly through the regulation of oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {Panax ginseng roots are well known for their medicinal properties and have been used in Korean and Chinese traditional medicines for 1000s of years. However, the medicinal value of P. ginseng fruits remain poorly characterized. In this study, we used an integrated biochemical, proteomics, and metabolomics approach to look into the medicinal properties of ginseng fruits. DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS [2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)] assays showed higher antioxidant activities in ginseng fruits than leaves or roots. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) profiling of ginseng fruit proteins (cv. Cheongsun) showed more than 400 spots wherein a total of 81 protein spots were identified by mass spectrometry using NCBInr, UniRef, and an in-house developed RNAseq (59,251 protein sequences)-based databases. Gene ontology analysis showed that most of the identified proteins were related to the hydrolase (18\%), oxidoreductase (16\%), and ATP binding (15\%) activities. Further, a comparative proteome analysis of four cultivars of ginseng fruits (cvs. Yunpoong, Gumpoong, Chunpoong, and Cheongsun) led to the identification of 22 differentially modulated protein spots. Using gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS), 66 metabolites including amino acids, sugars, organic acids, phenolic acids, phytosterols, tocopherols, and policosanols were identified and quantified. Some of these are well known medicinal compounds and were not previously identified in ginseng. Interestingly, the concentration of almost all metabolites was higher in the Chunpoong and Gumpoong cultivars. Parallel comparison of the four cultivars also revealed higher amounts of the medicinal metabolites in Chunpoong and Gumpoong cultivars. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ginseng fruits are a rich source of medicinal compounds with potential beneficial health effects.},

This review provides a summary regarding the sources, pharmacokinetic aspects and pharmacodynamics of PS, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying its protective effects against cancer, brain injuries and heart disease.

Magnolol (M) extracted from Magnolia officinalis exhibits several pharmacological effects including anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. In this study, we investigated whether magnolol supplementation protects against the development of cachexia symptoms in bladder cancer-bearing mice undergoing chemotherapy. Combined treatment of magnolol with chemotherapeutic drugs, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin (TGCM) or gemcitabine (TGM), markedly attenuates the body weight loss and skeletal muscle atrophy compared with conventional chemotherapy (TGC). The antiatrophic effect of magnolol may be associated with inhibition of myostatin and activin A formation, as well as FoxO3 transcriptional activity resulting from Akt activation, thereby suppressing ubiquitin ligases MuRF-1 and MAFbx/atrogin-1 expression, as well as proteasomal enzyme activity. Notably, magnolol-induced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production and related protein synthesis may also contribute to its protective effects. The decreased food intake, and intestinal injury and dysfunction observed in the mice of TGC group were significantly improved in the TGCM and TGM groups. Moreover, the increased inflammatory responses evidenced by elevation of proinflammatory cytokine formation and NF-ÎºB activation occurred in the atrophying muscle of TGC group were markedly inhibited in mice of combined treatment with magnolol. In summary, these findings support that magnolol is a promising chemopreventive supplement for preventing chemotherapy-induced skeletal muscle atrophy associated with cancer cachexia by suppressing muscle protein degradation, and inflammatory responses, as well as increasing IGF-1-mediated protein synthesis.},

Level of NO was determined to decrease in blood and tissues whereas MDA increased in arsenic given mice. Tissue protein carbonyl content also increased in this group. Immunoreactivity for iNOS and eNOS was noted to increase with arsenic treatment. Oleuropein treatment had significant effects in normalizing the MDA and NO levels as well as protein carbonyl content. Immunohistochemical staining also showed reduction of the expression of iNOS and eNOS in liver. The results indicate that oleuropein ameliorates oxidative tissue damage by scavenging free radicals.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative amyloid disease and is considered a social and clinical problem the last decades, particularly in the Western countries. Amyloid diseases are characterized by the deposition of typically aggregated protein/peptides in tissues that are associated with brain degeneration and progressive cognitive impairment. The amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles arise as a result of self-assembly into fibrillar material of amyloid-β protein and hyperphosphorylated tau, respectively. Moreover, mounting evidence shows that oxidative and nitrosative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. Oleuropein belongs to a specific group of polyphenols, the secoiridoids, which are abundant in Oleaceae. Oleuropein aglycone is abundant in extra virgin olive oil and it is generated as a product of a glucosidase released when olive fruits are crushed. This secoiridoid compound has radical-scavenging activity and antioxidative effects and it is considered a promising target to prevent amyloid toxicity as an inhibitor of the oligomer nucleation and growth. The neuroprotective and antioxidant effects of flavonoids have been found to strongly depend on their structure and functional groups. Oleuropein aglycone counteracts amyloid aggregation and toxicity affecting different pathways: amyloid precursor protein processing, amyloid-β peptide and tau aggregation, autophagy impairment, and neuroinflammation. In the current work, available literature on oleuropein aglycone effects as antioxidant and inhibitor of amyloid deposits in AD is reviewed. Moreover, we discuss the chemistry, food sources and bioavailability of oleuropein aglycone.},

	abstract = {Berberine has been shown to possess anti-tumor activity against a wide spectrum of cancer cells. It inhibits cancer cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest, at G1 and/or G2/M, and apoptosis. While it has been documented that berberine induces G1 arrest by activating the p53-p21 cascade, it remains unclear what mechanism underlies the berberine-induced G2/M arrest, which is p53-independent. In this study, we tested the anti-proliferative effect of berberine on murine prostate cancer cell line RM-1 and characterized the underlying mechanisms. Berberine dose-dependently induced DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis. At low concentrations, berberine was observed to induce G1 arrest, concomitant with the activation of p53-p21 cascade. Upon exposure to berberine at a higher concentration (50 Î¼M) for 24h, cells exhibited G2/M arrest. Pharmacological inhibition of ATM by KU55933, or Chk1 by UCN-01, could efficiently abrogate the G2/M arrest in berberine-treated cells. Downregulation of Chk1 by RNA interference also abolished the G2/M arrest caused by berberine, confirming the role of Chk1 in the pathway leading to G2/M arrest. Abrogation of G2/M arrest by ATM inhibition forced more cells to undergo apoptosis in response to berberine treatment. Chk1 inhibition by UCN-01, on the other hand, rendered cells more sensitive to berberine only when p53 was inhibited. Our results suggest that combined administration of berberine and caffeine, or other ATM inhibitor, may accelerate the killing of cancer cells.},

In this study, we investigated the effects of berberine on lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the molecular mechanisms mediating the effect. The effects of berberine on LPS-induced cell apoptosis and viability were measured with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine staining, flow cytometry, and Cell Counting Kit-8 assays. The expression and/or activation of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins or signaling pathways, including caspase-3, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, were determined with western blotting. The malondialdehyde levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and production of proinflammatory cytokines were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The results demonstrated that berberine pretreatment protected HUVECs from LPS-induced apoptosis, attenuated LPS-induced injury, inhibited LPS-induced JNK phosphorylation, increased MCL-1 expression and SOD activity, and decreased proinflammatory cytokine production. The effects of berberine on LPS-treated HUVECs were prevented by SP600125, a JNK-specific inhibitor. Thus, berberine might be a potential candidate in the treatment of endothelial cell injury-related vascular diseases.},

This study aimed to evaluate the possible efficacies of celecoxib, omega-3 or the combination of celecoxib+risperidone and omega-3+ risperidone compared to risperidone on the behavior and brain biochemistry in rats. In the present study, an amphetamine-induced model of schizophrenia in adult male rats was used to evaluate the effects of celecoxib, omega-3, celecoxib+risperidone and omega-3+ risperidone on the behavior of animals and on brain lipid peroxidation or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In the water maze task, celecoxib, omega-3, celecoxib+risperidone, omega-3+ risperidone significantly decreased the latency time compared to amphetamine-treated group. Celecoxib, omega-3, celecoxib+risperidone, omega-3+risperidone also significantly reversed the decreased spontaneous alternation induced by amphetamine in the Y-maze task. In the social interaction task, groups treated with celecoxib, omega-3, celecoxib+risperidone, omega-3+ risperidone spent less time to recognize foreign animals than animals in the amphetamine-treated group. Increased brain MDA and TNF-Î± levels due to amphetamine were significantly reduced in groups treated with celecoxib+risperidone or omega-3+ risperidone. The present findings showed that celecoxib or omega-3 can attenuate amphetamine- induced behavioral impairment and these effects may be associated with their ability to decrease lipid peroxidation and cytokine release.

Cd exposure has been associated with increased risk of chronic diseases, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and nephropathy, all of which could be attributable to dysfunctional endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Cd toxicity is correlated with increased reactive oxygen formation and depletion of antioxidants, resulting in an oxidative stress. Chelation of Cd has proved useful in the removal of the Cd burden. However, several chelating agents cause side effects in clinical usage. Recent studies have shown that the antioxidant compounds curcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin can alleviate vascular dysfunction and high blood pressure caused by Cd toxicity. In chronic Cd exposure, these antioxidants protect vascular endothelium by increasing nitric oxide (NO•) bioavailability and improving vascular function. Antioxidant activity against Cd intoxication results directly and/or indirectly through free radical scavenging, metal chelation, enhanced expression of the antioxidant defense system, regulation of inflammatory enzymes, increase in NO• bioavailability, and reduction of gastrointestinal absorption and tissue Cd accumulation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although a reductionist approach has sought to understand the roles of individual nutrients and biochemicals in foods, it has become apparent that there can be differences when studying food components in isolation or within the natural matrix of a whole food.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the ability of whole-food intake to modulate the development of obesity and other metabolic dysfunction in mice fed a high-fat (HF), Western-style obesogenic diet. To test the hypothesis that an n-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid-rich food could synergize with other, largely polyphenol-rich foods by producing greater reductions in metabolic disease conditions, the intake of English walnuts was evaluated in combination with 9 other whole foods.
METHODS: Eight-week-old male C57Bl/6J mice were fed low-fat (LF; 10\% fat) and HF control diets, along with an HF diet with 8.6\% (wt:wt) added walnuts for 9 wk. The HF control diet contained 46\% fat with added sucrose (10.9\%, wt:wt) and cholesterol (1\%, wt:wt); the added sucrose and cholesterol were not present in the LF diet. Other groups were provided the walnut diet with a second whole food-raspberries, apples, cranberries, tart cherries, broccoli sprouts, olive oil, soy protein, or green tea. All of the energy-containing whole foods were added at an energy level equivalent to 1.5 servings/d. Body weights, food intake, and glucose tolerance were determined. Postmortem, serum lipids and inflammatory markers, hepatic fat, gene expression, and the relative concentrations of 594 biochemicals were measured.
RESULTS: The addition of walnuts with either raspberries, apples, or green tea reduced glucose area under the curve compared with the HF diet alone (-93\%, -64\%, and -54\%, respectively, P {\textless} 0.05). Compared with HF-fed mice, mice fed walnuts with either broccoli sprouts or green tea (-49\% and -61\%, respectively, P {\textless} 0.05) had reduced hepatic fat concentrations. There were differences in global gene expression patterns related to whole-food content, with many examples of differences in LF- and HF-fed mice, HF- and walnut-fed mice, and mice fed walnuts and walnuts plus other foods. The mean ± SEM increase in relative hepatic concentrations of the n-3 fatty acids α-linolenic acid, eicosapentanoic acid, and docosapentanoic acid in all walnut-fed groups was 124\% ± 13\%, 159\% ± 11\%, and 114\% ± 10\%, respectively (P {\textless} 0.0001), compared with LF- and HF-fed mice not consuming walnuts.
CONCLUSIONS: In obese male mice, walnut consumption with an HF Western-style diet caused changes in hepatic fat concentrations, gene expression patterns, and fatty acid concentrations. The addition of a second whole food in combination with walnuts produced other changes in metabolite concentrations and gene expression patterns and other physiologic markers. Importantly, these substantial changes occurred in mice fed typical amounts of intake, representing only 1.5 servings each food/d.},

	abstract = {Despite numerous studies chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) still remains an incurable disease. Therefore, all new compounds and novel strategies which are able to eradicate CLL cells should be considered as valuable clues for a potential future remedy against this malignancy. In the present study, the cytotoxic profiles of natural flavonoids were described in two human CLL cell lines, HG-3 and EHEB, indicating the flavone luteolin as the most potent flavonoid with half-maximal inhibitory constants (IC50) of 37 μM and 26 μM, respectively. Luteolin significantly increased the apoptotic cell population in both cell lines by increasing the activities of caspases-3 and -9 and triggering the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Two flavonols, fisetin and quercetin, were somewhat less efficient in suppressing cellular viability, whereas baicalein, chrysin, (+)-catechin and hesperetin exerted only a small or no response at doses as high as 100 μM. Both fisetin and quercetin were able to augment the cytotoxic activity of luteolin in both cell lines by reducing the IC50 values up to four fold. As a result of this, luteolin displayed cytotoxicity activity already at low micromolar concentrations that could potentially be physiologically achievable through oral ingestion. No other tested flavonoids were capable of sensitizing CLL cells to luteolin pointing to a specific binding of fisetin and quercetin to the cellular targets which interfere with the signaling pathways induced by luteolin. Although further molecular studies to unravel this potentiating mechanism are certainly needed, this phenomenon could contribute to future remedies for prevention and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) and its phosphorylated form (NADP(+)) are key molecules in ubiquitous bioenergetic and cellular signaling pathways, regulating cellular metabolism and homeostasis. Thus, supplementation with NAD(+) and NADP(+) precursors emerged as a promising strategy to gain many and multifaceted health benefits. In this proof-of-concept study, we sought to investigate whether chronic nicotinamide riboside administration (an NAD(+) precursor) affects exercise performance.
METHODS: Eighteen Wistar rats were equally divided in two groups that received either saline vehicle or nicotinamide riboside at a dose of 300 mg/kg body weight/day for 21 days via gavage. At the end of the 21-day administration protocol, both groups performed an incremental swimming performance test.
RESULTS: The nicotinamide riboside group showed a tendency towards worse physical performance by 35 \% compared to the control group at the final 10 \% load (94 ± 53 s for the nicotinamide riboside group and 145 ± 59 s for the control group; P = 0.071).
CONCLUSION: Our results do not confirm the previously reported ergogenic effect of nicotinamide riboside. The potentially negative effect of nicotinamide riboside administration on physical performance may be attributed to the pleiotropic metabolic and redox properties of NAD(+) and NADP(+).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the metabolic, lipolytic, and cardiovascular responses to supplementation with p-synephrine alone and in combination with caffeine during resistance exercise (RE).
METHODS: Twelve healthy men performed a control RE protocol (6 × 10 repetitions of squats) and were randomly assigned (using a double-blind crossover design with random protocol sequencing) to a supplement sequence: p-synephrine (S; 100 mg), p-synephrine + caffeine (SCF; 100 mg of p-synephrine plus 100 mg of caffeine), or a placebo (P). Subjects reported to the lab at a standard time, consumed a supplement, sat quietly for 45 minutes, performed the RE protocol, and sat quietly for 30 minutes. Blood samples were collected at rest (T1), after sitting quietly for 45 minutes (T2), immediately following RE (T3), and 15 minutes (T4) and 30 minutes (T5) postexercise. Oxygen consumption (VO2) and heart rate (HR) data were collected throughout.
RESULTS: Serum glycerol was significantly elevated at T2 only in S and SCF and T3 to T5 in all treatments. Nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations did not differ between treatments. Plasma glucose was significantly elevated compared to T1 with highest area under the curve values seen in SCF. Mean VO2 and energy expenditure (EE) were significantly higher in S and SCF through 30 minutes postexercise. Fat oxidation rates favored S and SCF between 25 and 30 minutes postexercise. Mean HR during RE was significantly highest in SCF.
CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with S and SCF increases lipolysis primarily at rest and increases VO2, EE, and fat oxidation rates 30 minutes following RE. No HR changes were observed unless caffeine was added.},

We evaluated whether a long-term healthy Nordic diet (ND) can modify the expression of inflammation and lipid metabolism-related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in individuals with MetS.
METHODS: A Nordic multicenter randomized dietary study included subjects (n = 213) with MetS, randomized to a ND group or a control diet (CD) group applying an isocaloric study protocol. In this sub-study, we included subjects (n = 89) from three Nordic centers: Kuopio (n = 26), Lund (n = 30), and Oulu (n = 33) with a maximum weight change of ±4 kg, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration ≤10 mg L(-1), and baseline body mass index {\textless}39 kg m(-2). PBMCs were isolated, and the mRNA gene expression analysis was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We analyzed the mRNA expression changes of 44 genes before and after a 2hOGTT at the beginning and the end of the intervention.
RESULTS: The healthy ND significantly down-regulated the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), interleukin 18 (IL18), and thrombospondin receptor (CD36) mRNA transcripts and significantly up-regulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD) mRNA transcript after the 2hOGTT compared to the CD.
CONCLUSIONS: A healthy ND is able to modify the gene expression in PBMCs after a 2hOGTT. However, more studies are needed to clarify the biological and clinical relevance of these findings.},

Berberine was given to Apc (min/+) mice for 12 weeks. Primary macrophages were isolated; after berberine treatment, the change in signaling cascade was determined. The total number and size of polyps were reduced remarkably in berberine group, compared with control group. A significant decrease in protein levels of F4/80, mannose receptor (MR), and COX-2 in stroma of intestinal polyps and an increase in the level of iNOS were observed after berberine treatment. The mRNA level of MR and Arg-1 in berberine group was significantly lower than those in IL-10 or IL-4 group, while no significant difference in mRNA levels of iNOS and CXCL10 was observed. The migration and invasiveness assays in vitro showed that berberine could reduce the capability of migration and invasiveness. These findings suggest that berberine attenuates intestinal tumorigenesis by inhibiting the migration and invasion of colorectal tumor cells via regulation of macrophage polarization.},

Totally 97 patients completed it. Then they were randomly assigned to the berberine group (the treatment group, 49 cases) and the placebo group (the control group, 48 cases). Patients in the treatment group took BC 300 mg, while those in the control group took placebo 300 mg, thrice per day for 3 successive months. Then placebos and BC were interrupted for 2 months (as washout period). All subjects received only diet control and physical activity during washout period. After washout period, placebos and BC were re-administered to all patients in the same way for 3 months.

In addition, fucoxanthin significantly reversed the scopolamine-induced increase of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and decreased both choline acetyltransferase activity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. Using an in vitro AChE activity assay, we discovered that fucoxanthin directly inhibits AChE with an IC50 value of 81.2 μM. Molecular docking analysis suggests that fucoxanthin likely interacts with the peripheral anionic site within AChE, which is in accordance with enzymatic activity results showing that fucoxanthin inhibits AChE in a non-competitive manner. Based on our current findings, we anticipate that fucoxanthin might exhibit great therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by acting on multiple targets, including inhibiting AChE and increasing BDNF expression.},

On the skin, it is suggested that silicon is important for optimal collagen synthesis and activation of hydroxylating enzymes, improving skin strength and elasticity. Regarding hair benefits, it was suggested that a higher silicon content in the hair results in a lower rate of hair loss and increased brightness. For these beneficial effects, there is growing interest in scientific studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of using dietary supplements containing silicon. Its use aims at increasing blood levels of this element and improving the skin and its annexes appearance. There are different forms of silicon supplements available and the most important consideration to be made in order to select the best option is related to safety and bioavailability. Silicon supplements are widely used, though there is wide variation in silicon bioavailability, ranging from values below 1\% up to values close to 50\%, depending on the chemical form. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the scientific literature related to the different chemical forms of silicon supplements available and the limitations and recent progress in this field. According to reported studies, among the different chemical forms available, the orthosilicic acid (OSA) presents the higher bioavailability, whereas the others forms have absorption inversely proportional to the degree of polymerization. However, clinical studies evaluating safety and efficacy are still lacking.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2 randomized controlled trials, it was reported that dark chocolate acutely decreased appetite in human subjects, but the authors did not assess the types or concentrations of cocoa compounds that are needed. Other studies have suggested that the cocoa compounds epicatechin and procyanidins may be involved.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to test the hypotheses that, compared with placebo (an alkalized cocoa mixture containing essentially no epicatechin or procyanidins), the following beverages cause a decrease in appetite: 1) a nonalkalized cocoa mixture; 2) epicatechin plus placebo; and 3) procyanidins plus placebo. We measured the concentrations of cocoa compounds in all beverages.
DESIGN: We used a 4-way randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled trial that was balanced for period and carryover effects in 28 healthy, young-adult men. We also conducted a smaller (n = 14), parallel, secondary randomized trial in which we explored the effects of higher doses of epicatechin and procyanidins. Our primary measure of appetite was ad libitum pizza intake 150 min after beverage ingestion. We used a linear mixed-model analysis.
RESULTS: Intakes of beverages with the nonalkalized cocoa mixture that contained 0.6 mg epicatechin, 0.2 mg catechin, and 2.9 mg monomer-decamer procyanidins/kg body weight did not decrease pizza intake significantly (P = 0.29) compared with intake of the placebo. In the smaller secondary trial, a combination of epicatechin and the nonalkalized cocoa mixture that contained 1.6 mg epicatechin/kg body weight significantly decreased pizza intake by 18.7\% (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Our nonalkalized cocoa mixture was associated with an acute decrease in food intake only after being supplemented with epicatechin. It is possible that epicatechin at a dose of {\textgreater}1.6 mg/kg body weight, alone or in concert with appropriate catalytic cocoa compounds, may be useful for helping people control their food intakes.

	abstract = {The earliest and perhaps best example of an interaction between nutrition and dementia is related to thiamine (vitamin B1). Throughout the last century, research showed that thiamine deficiency is associated with neurological problems, including cognitive deficits and encephalopathy. Multiple similarities exist between classical thiamine deficiency and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in that both are associated with cognitive deficits and reductions in brain glucose metabolism. Thiamine-dependent enzymes are critical components of glucose metabolism that are reduced in the brains of AD patients and by thiamine decline, and a decrease in their levels could account for the reduction in glucose metabolism. In preclinical models, reduced thiamine can drive AD-like abnormalities, including memory deficits, neuritic plaques, and hyperphosphorylation of tau. Furthermore, excess thiamine diminishes AD-like pathologies. In addition to dietary deficits, drugs or other manipulations that interfere with thiamine absorption can cause thiamine deficiency. Elucidating the reasons why the brains of AD patients are functionally thiamine deficient and determining the effects of thiamine restoration may provide critical information to help treat patients with AD.},

The present study investigated the protective effects of garlic on photo-damage and cellular senescence in UVB-exposed human keratinocytes, HaCaT cells. An in vitro cell free system was used to examine the scavenging activity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals and nitric oxide (NO). The effect of garlic extract on ROS formation, MMP-1 protein and mRNA expressions, cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, senescence associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, and silent information regulator T1 (SIRT1) activity were determined in UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells. Garlic exhibited strong DPPH radical and NO scavenging activity in cell free system exhibiting IC50 values of 2.50 mg/mL and 4.38 mg/mL, respectively. Garlic pretreatment attenuated the production of UVB-induced intracellular ROS. MMP-1 level, which has been known to be induced by ROS, was dramatically elevated by UVB irradiation, and UVB-induced MMP-1 mRNA and protein expressions were significantly reduced by garlic treatment (50 µg/mL) comparable to those of UV-unexposed control cells. UV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine productions (IL-6 and IL-1β) were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with garlic in a dose-dependent manner. SA-β-gal activity, a classical biomarker of cellular senescence, and SIRT1 activity, which has attracted attention as an anti-aging factor in recent years, were ameliorated by garlic treatment in UV-irradiated HaCaT cells. The present study provides the first evidence of garlic inhibiting UVB-induced photoaging as a result of augmentation of cellular senescence in HaCaT human keratinocytes.},

METHODS: In a parallel-designed randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 112 hyperlipidemic patients 30-60 years, were recruited from Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center. People were selected and randomly divided into four groups. Control blood samples were taken and height, weight, and blood pressure were recorded. (1) Received 20 g of garlic daily, plus 1 tablespoon lemon juice, (2) received 20 g garlic daily, (3) received 1 tablespoon of lemon juice daily, and (4) did not receive garlic or lemon juice. A study technician was done the random allocations using a random numbers table. All participants presented 3 days of dietary records and 3 days of physical activity records during 8 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at study baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention.
RESULTS: Results showed a significant decrease in total cholesterol (changes from baseline: 40.8 ± 6.1, P {\textless} 0.001), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (29.8 ± 2.6, P {\textless} 0.001), and fibrinogen (111.4 ± 16.1, P {\textless} 0.001) in the Group 1, in comparison with other groups. A greater reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed in Group 1 compared with the Groups 3 and 4 (37 ± 10, P = 0.01) (24 ± 1, P = 0.02); respectively. Furthermore, a great reduction in body mass index was observed in the mixed group compared with the lemon juice and control groups (1.6 ± 0.1, P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Administration of garlic plus lemon juice resulted in an improvement in lipid levels, fibrinogen and blood pressure of patients with hyperlipidemia.},

	abstract = {Several lines of evidence suggest that oxidatively modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is atherogenic, and that atherosclerosis can be attenuated by natural antioxidants, which inhibit LDL oxidation. This study was conducted to determine the effect of tomato lycopene alone, or in combination with other natural antioxidants, on LDL oxidation. LDL (100 microg of protein/ml) was incubated with increasing concentrations of lycopene or of tomato oleoresin (lipid extract of tomatoes containing 6\% lycopene, 0.1\% beta-carotene, 1\% vitamin E, and polyphenols), after which it was oxidized by the addition of 5 micromol/liter of CuSO4. Tomato oleoresin exhibited superior capacity to inhibit LDL oxidation in comparison to pure lycopene, by up to five-fold [97\% vs. 22\% inhibition of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) formation, and 93\% vs. 27\% inhibition of lipid peroxides formation, respectively]. Because tomato oleoresin also contains, in addition to lycopene, vitamin E, flavonoids, and phenolics, a possible cooperative interaction between lycopene and such natural antioxidants was studied. A combination of lycopene (5 micromol/liter) with vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) in the concentration range of 1-10 micromol/liter resulted in an inhibition of copper ion-induced LDL oxidation that was significantly greater than the expected additive individual inhibitions. The synergistic antioxidative effect of lycopene with vitamin E was not shared by gamma-to-cotrienol. The polyphenols glabridin (derived from licorice), rosmarinic acid or carnosic acid (derived from rosemary), as well as garlic (which contains a mixture of natural antioxidants) inhibited LDL oxidation in a dose-dependent manner. When lycopene (5 micromol/liter) was added to LDL in combination with glabridin, rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid, or garlic, synergistic antioxidative effects were obtained against LDL oxidation induced either by copper ions or by the radical generator AAPH. Similar interactive effects seen with lycopene were also observed with beta-carotene, but, however, to a lesser extent of synergism. Because natural antioxidants exist in nature in combination, the in vivo relevance of lycopene in combination with other natural antioxidants was studied. Four healthy subjects were administered a fatty meal containing 30 mg of lycopene in the form of tomato oleoresin. The lycopene concentration in postprandial plasma was elevated by 70\% in comparison to plasma obtained before meal consumption. Postprandial LDL isolated 5 hr after meal consumption exhibited a significant (p {\textless} 0.01) reduced susceptibility to oxidation by 21\%. We conclude that lycopene acts synergistically, as an effective antioxidant against LDL oxidation, with several natural antioxidants such as vitamin E, the flavonoid glabridin, the phenolics rosmarinic acid and carnosic acid, and garlic. These observations suggest a superior antiatherogenic characteristic to a combination of different natural antioxidants over that of an individual one.},

The aim of the present study was to utilize sensitive high-throughput transcriptome analyses to investigate potential unfavorable effects of oxidized fish oil (PV: 18 meq/kg; AV: 9) compared to high-quality fish oil (PV: 4 meq/kg; AV: 3).
METHODS: In a double-blinded randomized controlled study for seven weeks, 35 healthy subjects were assigned to 8 g of either oxidized fish oil or high quality fish oil. The daily dose of EPA+DHA was 1.6 g. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated at baseline and after 7 weeks and transcriptome analyses were performed with the illuminaHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip.
RESULTS: No gene transcripts, biological processes, pathway or network were significantly changed in the oxidized fish oil group compared to the fish oil group. Furthermore, gene sets related to oxidative stress and cardiovascular disease were not differently regulated between the groups. Within group analyses revealed a more prominent effect after intake of high quality fish oil as 11 gene transcripts were significantly (FDR {\textless} 0.1) changed from baseline versus three within the oxidized fish oil group.
CONCLUSION: The suggested concern linking lipid oxidation products to short-term unfavorable health effects may therefore not be evident at a molecular level in this explorative study.

	abstract = {Academic achievement in adolescents is correlated with 1-carbon metabolism (1-CM), as folate intake is positively related and total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) negatively related to academic success. Because another 1-CM nutrient, choline is essential for fetal neurocognitive development, we hypothesized that choline and betaine could also be positively related to academic achievement in adolescents. In a sample of 15-yr-old children (n= 324), we measured plasma concentrations of homocysteine, choline, and betaine and genotyped them for 2 polymorphisms with effects on 1-CM, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C{\textgreater}T, rs1801133, and phosphatidylethanolamineN-methyltransferase (PEMT), rs12325817 (G{\textgreater}C). The sum of school grades in 17 major subjects was used as an outcome measure for academic achievement. Lifestyle and family socioeconomic status (SES) data were obtained from questionnaires. Plasma choline was significantly and positively associated with academic achievement independent of SES factors (paternal education and income, maternal education and income, smoking, school) and of folate intake (P= 0.009,R(2)= 0.285). With the addition of thePEMTrs12325817 polymorphism, the association value was only marginally changed. Plasma betaine concentration, tHcy, and theMTHFR677C{\textgreater}T polymorphism did not affect academic achievement in any tested model involving choline.

	abstract = {AIM: We investigated the uptake and pharmacokinetics of l-ergothioneine (ET), a dietary thione with free radical scavenging and cytoprotective capabilities, after oral administration to humans, and its effect on biomarkers of oxidative damage and inflammation.
RESULTS: After oral administration, ET is avidly absorbed and retained by the body with significant elevations in plasma and whole blood concentrations, and relatively low urinary excretion ({\textless}4\% of administered ET). ET levels in whole blood were highly correlated to levels of hercynine and S-methyl-ergothioneine, suggesting that they may be metabolites. After ET administration, some decreasing trends were seen in biomarkers of oxidative damage and inflammation, including allantoin (urate oxidation), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (DNA damage), 8-iso-PGF2Î± (lipid peroxidation), protein carbonylation, and C-reactive protein. However, most of the changes were non-significant.
INNOVATION: This is the first study investigating the administration of pure ET to healthy human volunteers and monitoring its uptake and pharmacokinetics. This compound is rapidly gaining attention due to its unique properties, and this study lays the foundation for future human studies.
CONCLUSION: The uptake and retention of ET by the body suggests an important physiological function. The decreasing trend of oxidative damage biomarkers is consistent with animal studies suggesting that ET may function as a major antioxidant but perhaps only under conditions of oxidative stress.

	abstract = {AIMS: Poor prognosis in chronic heart failure (HF) is linked to endothelial dysfunction for which there is no specific treatment currently available. Previous studies have shown reproducible improvements in endothelial function with cocoa flavanols, but the clinical benefit of this effect in chronic HF has yet to be determined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the potential therapeutic value of a high dose of cocoa flavanols in patients with chronic HF, by using reductions in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) as an index of improved cardiac function.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with chronic HF, stable on guideline-directed medical therapy, were randomized to consume 50 g/day of high-flavanol dark chocolate (HFDC; 1064 mg of flavanols/day) or low-flavanol dark chocolate (LFDC; 88 mg of flavanols/day) for 4 weeks and then crossed over to consume the alternative dark chocolate for a further 4 weeks. Twenty-four patients completed the study. After 4 weeks of HFDC, NT-proBNP (mean decrease \% ± standard deviation) was significantly reduced compared with baseline (-44 ± 69\%), LFDC (-33 ± 72\%), and follow-up (-41 ± 77\%) values. HFDC also reduced diastolic blood pressure compared with values after LFDC (-6.7 ± 10.1 mmHg).
CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in blood pressure and NT-proBNP after HFDC indicate decreased vascular resistance resulting in reduced left ventricular afterload. These effects warrant further investigation in patients with chronic HF.},

A significant accumulation of PAR polymers and increase of PARP1 expression were detected in the cortex at the early (3.5 months) and intermediate (6 months) stage of Aβ deposition in the TgCRND8 mouse model. Our previous data highlighted the beneficial effects of oleuropein aglycone (OLE), the main polyphenol found in the olive oil, against neurodegeneration both in cultured cells and in model organisms. Here we found that 8-week OLE treatment (50 mg/kg of diet) to 6-month-old TgCRND8 mice rescued to control values PARP1 activation and the levels of its product, PAR. In N2a neuroblastoma cells, PARP1 activation and PAR formation upon exposure to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) were abolished by pretreatment for 24 h with either OLE (100μM) or PARP inhibitors. A significant reduction of the NAD+ content, compared to controls, was found in N2a cells exposed to MNNG (100μM) for 90 min; the latter was slightly attenuated by cell treatment for 24 h with PJ-34 or with OLE. In vitro and in vivo, the OLE-induced reduction of PARP1 activation was paralleled by the overexpression of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), and, in vivo, by a decrease of NF-κB and the pro-apoptotic marker p53. In N2a cells, we also found that OLE potentiates the MNNG-induced increase of Beclin1 levels. In conclusion, our data show that OLE treatment counteracts neuronal damage through modulation of the PARP1-SIRT1 interplay.},

Most of the studies have used either beetroot juice or sodium nitrate as a supplement; there is lack of data on the potential ergogenic benefits of an increased dietary nitrate intake from a diet based on fruits and vegetables. Our aim was to assess whether a high-nitrate diet increases nitric oxide bioavailability and to evaluate the effects of this nutritional intervention on exercise performance. Seven healthy male subjects participated in a randomized cross-over study. They were tested before and after 6 days of a high (HND) or control (CD) nitrate diet ({\textasciitilde}8.2 mmol∙day(-1) or {\textasciitilde}2.9 mmol∙day(-1), respectively). Plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations were significantly higher in HND (127 ± 64 µM and 350 ± 120 nM, respectively) compared to CD (23 ± 10 µM and 240 ± 100 nM, respectively). In HND (vs. CD) were observed: (a) a significant reduction of oxygen consumption during moderate-intensity constant work-rate cycling exercise (1.178 ± 0.141 vs. 1.269 ± 0.136 L·min(-1)); (b) a significantly higher total muscle work during fatiguing, intermittent sub-maximal isometric knee extension (357.3 ± 176.1 vs. 253.6 ± 149.0 Nm·s·kg(-1)); (c) an improved performance in Repeated Sprint Ability test. These findings suggest that a high-nitrate diet could be a feasible and effective strategy to improve exercise performance.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a randomized single-blinded nonplacebo-controlled study. Twenty-seven participants received 1200 IU vitamin D3 and 800 mg calcium, and 25 participants received additionally 0.5 mg folic acid, 50 mg B6, and 0.5 mg B12 for 1 year. Plasma homocysteine (Hcy), TMAO, and choline metabolites were measured at baseline and 12 months later. TMAO declined in the vitamin D arm by 0.5 versus 2.8 Î¼mol/L in the D + B arm (p = 0.005). Hcy decreased and betaine increased in the D + B compared to the D arm. Within-subject levels of plasma choline and dimethylglycine and urine betaine increased in both arms and changes did not differ between the arms. TMAO reduction was predicted by higher baseline TMAO and lowering Hcy in stepwise regression analysis. The test-retest variations of TMAO were greater in the D + B arm compared to vitamin D arm.
CONCLUSION: B vitamins plus vitamin D lowered plasma fasting TMAO compared to vitamin D. Vitamin D caused alterations in choline metabolism, which may reflect the metabolic flexibility of C1-metabolism. The molecular mechanisms and health implications of these changes are currently unknown.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Elevated serum uric acid (UA), a biomarker of renal insufficiency, is also an independent prognostic marker for morbidity in coronary artery disease (CAD) and poses serious health risks. This study reports the effect of almond consumption on UA in CAD patients.
STUDY DESIGN: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted with three groups: no-intervention (NI), Pakistani almonds (PA) or American almonds (AA). Patients were recruited from the Cardiology Clinics, Aga Khan University Hospital. Two follow-ups were scheduled at week-6 and week-12. 150 patients were randomly divided in three groups (50 per group). NI was not given almonds, whereas the PA and AA were given Pakistani and American almond varieties (10 g/day), respectively; with instruction to soak overnight and eat before breakfast.
RESULTS: Almonds supplementation significantly reduced (p {\textless} 0.05) serum UA among groups, and over time. At week-6, UA concentrations were -13 to -16 \% less in PA and AA; at week-12 the concentrations were -14 to -18 \% less, compared to NI. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and body weights of the participants remained fairly constant among all the groups.
CONCLUSION: Almonds (10 g/day), eaten before breakfast, reduces serum UA in CAD patients. Prevention of hyperuricemia can confer protection from kidney and vascular damage and if extrapolated for general population, dietary almonds can offer grander health benefit.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selenium supplementation may help to prevent colorectal cancer; as precursors of colorectal cancer, colorectal adenomas are a surrogate for colorectal cancer. Selenium supplementation may increase risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D).
METHODS: The Selenium and Celecoxib (Sel/Cel) Trial was a randomized, placebo controlled trial of selenium 200 µg daily as selenized yeast and celecoxib 400 mg once daily, alone or together, for colorectal adenoma prevention. Men and women between age 40 and 80 years were eligible following colonoscopic removal of colorectal adenomas. The primary outcome was adenoma development. Celecoxib was suspended because of cardiovascular toxicity in other trials, but accrual continued to selenium and placebo. A total of 1621 participants were randomly assigned to selenium or placebo, of whom 1374 (84.8\%) were available for analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: In the respective placebo and selenium arms of 689 and 685 participants, adenoma detection after medians of 33.6 (range = 0.0-85.1 months) and 33.0 months (range = 0.0-82.6 months) were 42.8\% and 44.1\% (relative risk [RR] = 1.03, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91 to 1.16, P = .68). In participants with baseline advanced adenomas, adenoma recurrence was reduced by 18\% with selenium (RR = 0.82, 95\% CI = 0.71 to 0.96, P = .01). In participants receiving selenium, the hazard ratio for new-onset T2D was 1.25 (95\% CI = 0.74 to 2.11, P = .41), with a statistically significantly increased risk of selenium-associated T2D among older participants (RR = 2.21; 95\% CI = 1.04 to 4.67, P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, selenium did not prevent colorectal adenomas and showed only modest benefit in patients with baseline advanced adenomas. With limited benefit and similar increases in T2D to other trials, selenium is not recommended for preventing colorectal adenomas in selenium-replete individuals.},

There was no difference in the geometric mean plasma AUCs when adjusted for the 10-fold difference in curcumin dose between the 2 formulations. Phosphatidylcholine curcumin extract yielded only 20\% to 30\% plasma demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin conjugates compared to standard extract, yet yielded 20-fold greater hexahydrocurcumin. When adjusting for curcumin dose, tissue curcumin concentrations were 5-fold greater for the phosphatidylcholine extract. Improvements in curcuminoid absorption due to phosphatidylcholine are not uniform across the curcuminoids. Furthermore, curcuminoid exposures in the intestinal mucosa are most likely due to luminal exposure rather than to plasma disposition. Finally, once-daily dosing is sufficient to maintain detectable curcuminoids at steady state in both plasma and rectal tissues.},

Despite intensive research, the mechanisms involved in neuronal loss are not completely understood yet; however, misfolded proteins, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and inflammation play a pivotal role in the progression of the pathology. Neuroinflammation may have a greater function in PD pathogenesis than initially believed, taking part in the cascade of events that leads to neuronal death. To date, no efficient therapy, able to arrest or slow down PD, is available. In this context, the need to find novel strategies to counteract neurodegenerative progression by influencing diseases' pathogenesis is becoming increasingly clear. Isothiocyanates (ITCs) have already shown interesting properties in detoxification, inflammation, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation through the induction of phase I and phase II enzyme systems. Moreover, ITCs may be able to modulate several key points in oxidative and inflammatory evolution. In view of these considerations, the aim of the present review is to describe ITCs as pleiotropic compounds capable of preventing and modulating the evolution of PD.},

However, the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid consumption on age-related cardiovascular responses at the onset of isometric handgrip exercise, a time of rapid autonomic adjustments, is unknown. Accordingly, 14 young (25 ± 1 years; mean ± SE) and 15 older (64 ± 2 years) healthy subjects ingested 4 g FO daily for 12 weeks. On pre- and postintervention visits, participants performed 15-sec bouts of isometric handgrip at 10\%, 30\%, 50\%, and 70\% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) while beat-to-beat systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure (SBP, DBP, MAP; Finometer) and heart rate (HR; electrocardiogram) were recorded. All baseline cardiovascular variables were similar between groups and visits, except DBP was higher in older subjects (P {\textless} 0.05). FO increased erythrocyte EPA and DHA content in both groups (P {\textless} 0.05). FO attenuated MAP and DBP increases in response to handgrip in both age groups (change from baseline during 70\% MVC handgrip pre- and post-FO: young MAPΔ 14 ± 2 mmHg versus 10 ± 2 mmHg, older MAPΔ 14 ± 3 mmHg versus 11 ± 2 mmHg; young DBPΔ 12 ± 1 mmHg versus 7 ± 2 mmHg, older DBPΔ 12 ± 1 mmHg versus 7 ± 1 mmHg; P {\textless} 0.05). FO augmented the PP (SBP-DBP) increase with 70\% MVC handgrip in both groups (P {\textless} 0.05), but did not alter SBP or HR increases with handgrip.

	abstract = {SCOPE: It has been demonstrated that a mutation of MTHFR C677T increases plasma total homocysteine (Hcy) concentration and decreases folate. Natural foods can improve Hcy levels, but the effect of certain foods remains undetermined. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between food groups and Hcy, and to explore the correlations between Hcy and dietary folate/vitamin (Vit) B12 for genotype-specific population.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 4507 adults were enrolled in this study, all of whom underwent physical examinations and genotyping. A dietary recall questionnaire, which assessed the frequency (F) and quantity (Q) of food consumption, was completed by all. For the male CC group, after adjustment for age and BMI, fish (F) was negatively correlated with Hcy; for the male CT group, fish (F) and eggs (F) were negatively associated with Hcy, whereas cereal/wheat (Q) were positively correlated with Hcy; for the male TT group, fish (F), meat (Q), milk (F), and fruits/vegetables (Q) were negatively associated with Hcy, whereas sugar (Q) and salt (Q) were positively associated with Hcy. For the female CC group, fruits/vegetables (Q), eggs (F) and meat (F) were negatively correlated with Hcy, but soy (F) was positively correlated with Hcy; for the female CT group, eggs (F) and meat (Q) were negatively correlated with Hcy, whereas soy (F), fried foods (F) and salt (Q) were positively correlated with Hcy; for the female TT group, fish(F), eggs (F), and fruits/vegetables (F) were negatively associated with Hcy. Furthermore, we found that Hcy was more closely correlated with folate than with Vit B12 for males (CC, CT and TT) and female TT genotype. However, the correlation between Hcy and Vit B12 was stronger for the female CT/CC groups.
CONCLUSION: Hcy levels were influenced by food groups to varying degrees, which were based on gender and MTHFR C677T genotypes. Hcy levels were more closely correlated with folate for males (CC, CT and TT) and the female TT group, but it was more closely correlated with Vit B12 for the female CT/CC groups.},

Of those showing diffuse telogen effluvium in trichograms (24\%), 35\% had evidence of associated seborrheic-like dermatitis. About 11\% of patients with biotin deficiency had a positive personal history for risk factors for biotin deficiency.

The RAVLT included 5, 15-item auditory word recalls (R1-5), an interference word recall (RB), a 6th word recall (R6), and a 15-item visual word recognition trial (RR). For handgrip performance, subjects completed maximal voluntary isometric handgrip strength (MVIC) testing before (MVICPRE) and after (MVICPOST) a handgrip fatigue test at 50\% MVICPRE. Hand joint discomfort was measured during MVICPRE, MVICPOST, and the handgrip fatigue test. There were no treatment differences (p{\textgreater}0.05) for handgrip strength, handgrip fatigue, or cognitive function as measured by the Trail Making Test and Serial Seven's Subtraction Test in men or women. However, RAR CLA supplementation improved cognitive function as indicated by the RAVLT R5 in men. A qualitative examination of the mean change scores suggested that, compared to PLA, RAR CLA supplementation was associated with a small improvement in joint discomfort in both men and women. Longer-term studies are needed to more fully understand the potential impact of RAR CLA on cognitive function and hand joint discomfort in older adults, particularly in those with lower cognitive function.},

Little scientific data is available concerning its safety despite the presence of potential toxic elements. Elemental composition in UNCP was analyzed with ED-XRF spectroscopy. Single oral high dose toxicity study was conducted on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (150 g) by the limit test method. One group received water and the test group 2000 mg/kg UNCP. All animals were observed for 14 days and then euthanized for haematological, biochemical, and histopathological examinations. Thirty-eight (38) elements were found in UNCP. There was an increase in HDL cholesterol (p {\textless} 0.05), reduction in LDL cholesterol (p {\textgreater} 0.05), alkaline phosphatase (p {\textless} 0.05), and creatinine levels, and slight increase in urea levels (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Haematological changes were not significant. Histopathological analysis showed no toxic effect on the heart, liver, kidney, lungs, testis, and spleen. Intestinal erosion was observed in the test group. UNCP appears to be relatively safe when taken as a single oral high dose of 2000 mg/kg b.w.t. in rats. Caution should however be exercised at high doses due to the high elemental content of copper and high possibility of intestinal lining erosion.},

	abstract = {Upregulation and/or maintenance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) during autoimmune insults may have therapeutic efficacy in autoimmune diseases. Earlier we have reported that sodium benzoate (NaB), a metabolite of cinnamon and a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug against urea cycle disorders, upregulates Tregs and protects mice from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. However, mechanisms by which NaB increases Tregs are poorly understood. Because TGF-β is an important inducer of Tregs, we examined the effect of NaB on the status of TGF-β. In this study, we demonstrated that NaB induced the expression of TGF-β mRNA and protein in normal as well as proteolipid protein-primed splenocytes. The presence of a consensus STAT6 binding site in the promoter of the TGF-β gene, activation of STAT6 in splenocytes by NaB, recruitment of STAT6 to the TGF-β promoter by NaB, and abrogation of NaB-induced expression of TGF-β in splenocytes by small interfering RNA knockdown of STAT6 suggest that NaB induces the expression of TGF-β via activation of STAT6. Furthermore, we demonstrated that blocking of TGF-β by neutralizing Abs abrogated NaB-mediated protection of Tregs and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These studies identify a new function of NaB in upregulating TGF-β via activation of STAT6, which may be beneficial in MS patients.},

	abstract = {SCOPE: The flavanol (-)-epicatechin (Epi) has cardioprotective effects and improves physical capacity in normal mice. In addition, Epi increases nitric oxide (NO) production by activation of both PI3K/Akt or Ca2+ /CaMI/CaMKII (where Akt is protein kinase B; PI3K is phosphoinositide 3-kinase; CaMI is calmodulin; CaMKII is Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) signaling pathways, which have been associated with physiological and pathological cardiac hypertrophy, respectively. Notwithstanding all this information, few studies have been carried out that aimed to determine the potential beneficial effects that Epi may have in normal heart.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice were treated by oral gavage with the flavanol Epi. The treatment induced a significant increase in heart weight, size of the free walls, and size of the cardiac fibers. Also, no evidence of cardiac fibrosis was revealed. Furthermore, the phosphorylation level of PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K (where mTOR is mammalian target of rapamycin; p70S6K is ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1) proteins was significantly higher in the heart of Epi-treated animals. In contrast, a significantly decreased level of pathological cardiac hypertrophy markers atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide was observed along with no modification in the level of β myosin heavy chain beta, calmodulin, and Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II proteins. Hemodynamic parameters indicated an improvement in mechanical heart performance after Epi treatment. Interestingly, morphometric parameters were similar between treated and untreated mice after 4 wk without treatment.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that Epi treatment induced physiological cardiac growth in healthy mice by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.},

The patient presented at age 28 with lymphocytosis, mild anemia, mild thrombocytopenia, and massive splenomegaly, for which a splenectomy was performed. He was then followed expectantly. Over the next two decades, he suffered two symptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia-related events. The first occurred twelve years after diagnosis (at age 40) when the patient developed fevers, night sweats, and moderate anemia. He was diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia secondary to chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The patient declined conventional therapy in favor of a diet, exercise, and supplement regimen, and recovered from the autoimmune hemolytic anemia though the underlying chronic lymphocytic leukemia remained evident. This is the first published case report of "spontaneous" recovery from secondary autoimmune hemolytic anemia in an adult.  Over the second decade following chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosis, serial bone marrow biopsies demonstrated increasing lymphocytosis, with minimal peripheral lymphocytosis. However, twenty years after diagnosis, peripheral lymphocytosis accelerated, with white blood cell counts rising to 55,000/µL. Because the patient continued to refuse conventional therapy, he was treated instead with a supplement regimen that included high doses of epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a green tea extract. Peripheral lymphocytosis resolved. More remarkably, a bone marrow examination, including flow cytometry, showed no evidence of a malignant clone. Two years later (at age 51), the peripheral blood and bone marrow were without molecular evidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or any malignancy. The patient remains well at age 52.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Docosahexanoic acid (DHA) is an important constituent of the brain. Evidence from well-designed intervention trials of the long-term benefits of increasing DHA intake during pregnancy has been sparse.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated global cognition, behavior, and attention at age 5 y in the offspring of Mexican women who participated in a randomized controlled trial of prenatal DHA supplementation.
DESIGN: A total of 1094 women were randomly assigned to receive 400 mg of either DHA or placebo/d from 18 to 22 wk of pregnancy until delivery. We assessed cognitive development and behavioral and executive functioning, including attention, in 797 offspring at age 5 y (82\% of 973 live births) with the use of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA), the parental scale of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2), and the Conners' Kiddie Continuous Performance Test (K-CPT). We compared the groups on raw scores, T-scores, and standardized scores, as appropriate. We examined heterogeneity by the quality of the home environment, maternal intelligence, and socioeconomic status.
RESULTS: There were no group differences for MSCA scores (P {\textgreater} 0.05), but the positive effect of the home environment at 12 mo on general cognitive abilities was attenuated in the DHA group compared with in the placebo group (P-interaction {\textless} 0.05). There were no differences between groups on the BASC-2. On the K-CPT, offspring in the DHA group showed improved mean ± SD T-scores compared with those of the placebo group for omissions (DHA: 47.6 ± 10.3; placebo: 49.6 ± 11.2; P {\textless} 0.01) with no differences (P {\textgreater} 0.05) for the other K-CPT scores or of the proportion who were clinically at risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
CONCLUSION: Prenatal exposure to DHA may contribute to improved sustained attention in preschool children. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00646360.},

Whilst dietary polyphenols have been the subject of breast cancer risk-reduction, this review will focus on the clinical effects of polyphenols on reducing recurrence. Overall, we recommend breast cancer patients consume a diet naturally high in flavonol polyphenols including tea, vegetables (onion, broccoli), and fruit (apples, citrus). At least five servings of vegetables and fruit daily appear protective. Moderate soy protein consumption (5-10 g daily) and the Mediterranean dietary pattern show the most promise for breast cancer patients.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Muscle wasting in patients with cancer has been linked to an increased activity of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and higher circulating levels of activin-A (ActA), a negative growth factor for muscle mass. Baicalin is a natural flavonoid that can reduce skeletal muscle atrophy in animal models of cancer cachexia by inhibiting NF-κB. This pilot open-label study assessed the effects of baicalin supplementation (50 mg daily for 3 months) in cancer patients who showed involuntary weight loss {\textgreater}5\% over the past 6 months.
METHODS: A total of 20 patients were investigated. Participants were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the 3-month study period for the following endpoints: 1) changes from baseline in serum NF-κB and ActA levels; and 2) change from baseline in lean body mass (LBM).
RESULTS: We observed significant reduction in both NF-κB (p{\textless}0.05) and ActA (p{\textless}0.05) serum levels from baseline to 3 months. At 3 months, patients also showed a significant mean increase in LBM (+0.8 kg, p{\textless}0.05 compared with baseline).
CONCLUSION: Our pilot open-label data suggest that baicalin supplementation is potentially useful for contrasting lean body mass reduction in cancer patients with involuntary weight loss, an effect which is likely mediated by the inhibition of negative growth factors for muscle mass.},

A randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, double-blinded trial involving 41 hypercholesterolemic individuals was conducted to simultaneously examine and compare the blood lipid lowering and antioxidant effects after acute and extended exposures to aged and raw garlic supplements (1080â€‰mg daily). Aged and raw garlic did not affect blood lipid concentrations in these hypercholesterolemic participants after acute and 13-week supplementation. The plasma and urinary F2-isoprostanes concentrations were significantly decreased after 13 weeks of aged garlic treatment. Aged garlic supplementation over 13 weeks also significantly decreased serum lipid hydroperoxide concentration and myeloperoxidase activity. Raw garlic treatments did not affect the F2-isoprostanes concentrations in blood plasma and urine, and lipid hydroperoxides in blood sera. Acute effects on the measured parameters were absent for both garlic treatments. In separate in vitro experiments, aqueous methanolic extract of aged garlic inhibited F2-isoprostanes formation and myeloperoxidase activity in freshly isolated human neutrophils to a greater extent than the raw garlic extract and S-allylcysteine at equivalent dosing concentrations. The aged garlic preparation was found to contain significantly higher total phenolic and S-allylcysteine contents than the raw garlic precursor. Our data showed that supplementation with aged garlic, not its raw garlic precursor, reduced oxidative stress and alleviated lipid peroxidation, possibly via the inhibition of myeloperoxidase. The differential antioxidant actions of the aged and raw garlic may be related to their different total phenolic contents and, to a lesser extent, their S-allylcysteine contents.},

Chronic hypobaric hypoxia induces right ventricular hypertrophy and apoptosis in rats: therapeutic potential of nanocurcumin in improving adaptation. High Alt Med Biol. 17:342-352, 2016.-a sustained work load on the right heart on ascent to high altitudes promotes right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), which eventually undergoes decompensation and promotes pathological damage. However, the exact set of events leading to damage remains unidentified. Curcumin is a natural antioxidant and antihypertrophic agent, but it has poor biostability. Nanotized curcumin (nanocurcumin) has emerged as a promising agent with improved biostability while retaining the therapeutic properties of curcumin. The present study aimed at analyzing the therapeutic properties of nanocurcumin in ameliorating cardiac damage due to chronic hypobaric hypoxia (HH)-induced RVH in comparison to curcumin. Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to HH (25,000 feet, effective oxygen fraction in air [FIO2] ∼0.08, temperature 28°C ± 1°C, relative humidity 55\% ± 2\% for 3, 7, 14, and 21 days) developed RVH with increased interstitial collagen content, Fulton's index, and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area while upregulating atrial natriuretic peptide. Tissue damage due to apoptotic cell death was evident by cytochrome-c/caspase-3 activation and TUNEL assay. Concomitant modulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)/cGK-1, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMkinase II), and intracellular calcium levels with increased free radical-induced damage and lipid peroxidation further contributed to the right heart pathology. Nanocurcumin supplementation decreased HH-induced RVH and apoptosis while modulating cardiac cGMP/cGK-1 signaling, and maintaining CaMkinase II, intracellular calcium levels and redox status better than curcumin. Nanocurcumin-mediated antiapoptotic effects might have benefited residents and sojourners at high altitude in preventing hypoxic cardiac damage.},

We first examined the effects of BCX on 4-[methyl nitrosamino]-1-[3-pyridyl]-1-butanone (NNK)-induced lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice. BCX supplementation was given daily to the mice starting 2 weeks prior to the injection of NNK and continued 16 weeks after NNK injection. BCX supplementation resulted in a dose-dependent increase of BCX concentration in both serum and lungs of the mice without a significant alteration of vitamin A (retinol and retinyl palmitate) concentration. BCX significantly reduced the multiplicity of the NNK-induced lung tumor by 52\% to 63\% compared with the NNK-treated mice without BCX supplementation. The protective effect of BCX in the lungs was associated with reductions of both mRNA and protein of the homopentameric neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7 (α7-nAChR), which has been implicated in lung tumorigenesis. We then conducted an in vitro cell culture study and found that BCX treatment suppressed α7-nAChR expression and inhibited the migration and invasion of α7-nAChR-positive lung cancer cells but not in cells lacking α7-nAChR. The activities of BCX were significantly attenuated by activators of α7-nAChR/PI3K signaling or by overexpression of constitutively active PI3K. Collectively, the results suggest that BCX inhibits lung tumorigenesis and cancer cell motility through the downregulation of α7-nAChR/PI3K signaling, independent of its provitamin A activity. Therefore, BCX can be used as a chemopreventive agent or a chemotherapeutic compound against lung cancer. Cancer Prev Res; 9(11); 875-86. ©2016 AACR.},

	abstract = {The antihypertensive effect of magnesium (Mg) supplementation remains controversial. We aimed to quantify the effect of oral Mg supplementation on blood pressure (BP) by synthesizing available evidence from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. We searched trials of Mg supplementation on normotensive and hypertensive adults published up to February 1, 2016 from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases; 34 trials involving 2028 participants were eligible for this meta-analysis. Weighted mean differences of changes in BP and serum Mg were calculated by random-effects meta-analysis. Mg supplementation at a median dose of 368 mg/d for a median duration of 3 months significantly reduced systolic BP by 2.00 mm Hg (95\% confidence interval, 0.43-3.58) and diastolic BP by 1.78 mm Hg (95\% confidence interval, 0.73-2.82); these reductions were accompanied by 0.05 mmol/L (95\% confidence interval, 0.03, 0.07) elevation of serum Mg compared with placebo. Using a restricted cubic spline curve, we found that Mg supplementation with a dose of 300 mg/d or duration of 1 month is sufficient to elevate serum Mg and reduce BP; and serum Mg was negatively associated with diastolic BP but not systolic BP (all P{\textless}0.05). In the stratified analyses, a greater reduction in BP tended to be found in trials with high quality or low dropout rate (all P values for interaction {\textless}0.05). However, residual heterogeneity may still exist after considering these possible factors. Our findings indicate a causal effect of Mg supplementation on lowering BPs in adults. Further well-designed trials are warranted to validate the BP-lowering efficacy of optimal Mg treatment.},

In this randomized controlled double-blind parallel prospective study, fifty-nine healthy adults were assigned to placebo, 50 mg (50 mg), or 200 mg (200 mg) curcumin, for 8 weeks. The higher curcumin (200 mg) supplementation produced a dose-mediated improvement in endothelial function measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD). The outcome was a clinically substantial 3.0\% increase (90\% CI 0.7 to 5.3\%, p = 0.032; benefit : harm odds ratio 546 : 1) with the 200 mg dose, relative to placebo. The 50 mg dose also increased FMD relative to placebo by 1.7\% (-0.6 to 4.0\%, p = 0.23; 25 : 1), but the outcome was not clinically decisive. In apparently healthy adults, 8 weeks of 200 mg oral curcumin supplementation resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in endothelial function as measured by FMD. Oral curcumin supplementation may present a simple lifestyle strategy for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. This trial was registered at ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN90184217).},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: COPD is mainly caused by tobacco smoking and is associated with a high frequency of coronary artery disease. There is growing recognition that the inflammation in COPD is not only confined to the lungs but also involves the systemic circulation and can impact nonpulmonary organs, including blood vessels. α1-antitrypsin-low-density lipoprotein (AT-LDL) complex is an oxidatively modified LDL that accelerates atherosclerosis. Curcumin, one of the best-investigated natural products, is a powerful antioxidant. However, the effects of curcumin on AT-LDL remain unknown. We hypothesized that Theracurmin(®), a highly absorptive curcumin with improved bioavailability using a drug delivery system, ameliorates the inflammatory status in subjects with mild COPD.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. Subjects with stages I-II COPD according to the Japanese Respiratory Society criteria were randomly assigned to receive 90 mg Theracurmin(®) or placebo twice a day for 24 weeks, and changes in inflammatory parameters were evaluated.
RESULTS: There were no differences between the Theracurmin(®) and placebo groups in terms of age, male/female ratio, or body mass index in 39 evaluable subjects. The percent changes in blood pressure and hemoglobin A1c and LDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, or high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels after treatment were similar for the two groups. However, the percent change in the AT-LDL level was significantly (P=0.020) lower in the Theracurmin(®) group compared with the placebo group.
CONCLUSION: Theracurmin(®) reduced levels of atherosclerotic AT-LDL, which may lead to the prevention of future cardiovascular events in mild COPD subjects.},

Blood flow, vessel diameter, SPO2, HR, and BP were assessed at baseline, 30 min post ingestion, immediately post exercise (IPost), and 30 min post exercise (30minPost). With PE, blood flow significantly increased IPost RSA (mean difference = 18.49 mL min-1; P {\textless} .05), and IPost and 30minPost RTF (P {\textless} .05) according to confidence intervals (CI). Vessel diameter increased significantly 30minPost RSA according to CI and resulted in a significant interaction IPost and 30minPost RTF (P {\textless} .05). With PE, according to CI, average and peak power output increased significantly in sprint 5 of the RSA (P {\textless} .05). There was no significant difference between PE and PL for bench (P = .25) or leg press (P = .15) repetitions. Acute PE supplementation enhanced vessel diameter and blood flow, suggesting possible exercise performance enhancement from increased delivery of substrates and oxygen.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coffee and tea are 2 of the most commonly consumed beverages in the world. The association of coffee and tea intake with coronary artery calcium and major adverse cardiovascular events remains uncertain.
METHODS: We examined 6508 ethnically diverse participants with available coffee and tea data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Intake for each was classified as never, occasional ({\textless}1 cup per day), and regular (≥1 cup per day). A coronary artery calcium progression ratio was derived from mixed effect regression models using loge(calcium score+1) as the outcome, with coefficients exponentiated to reflect coronary artery calcium progression ratio versus the reference. Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to evaluate the association between beverage intake and incident cardiovascular events.
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 5.3 years for coronary artery calcium and 11.1 years for cardiovascular events, participants who regularly drank tea (≥1 cup per day) had a slower progression of coronary artery calcium compared with never drinkers after multivariable adjustment. This correlated with a statistically significant lower incidence of cardiovascular events for ≥1 cup per day tea drinkers (adjusted hazard ratio 0.71; 95\% confidence interval 0.53-0.95). Compared with never coffee drinkers, regular coffee intake (≥1 cup per day) was not statistically associated with coronary artery calcium progression or cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio 0.97; 95\% confidence interval 0.78-1.20). Caffeine intake was marginally inversely associated with coronary artery calcium progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Moderate tea drinkers had slower progression of coronary artery calcium and reduced risk for cardiovascular events. Future research is needed to understand the potentially protective nature of moderate tea intake.},

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a flavonoid-rich extract from orange juice (OJe) in some rodent models of epilepsy and to explore its possible mechanism of action. The genetically audiogenic seizures (AGS)-susceptible DBA/2 mouse, the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in ICR-CD1 mice and the WAG/Rij rat as a genetic model of absence epilepsy with comorbidity of depression were used. Our results demonstrate that OJe was able to exert anticonvulsant effects on AGS-sensible DBA/2 mice and to inhibit PTZ-induced tonic seizures, increasing their latency. Conversely, it did not have anti-absence effects on WAG/Rij rats. Our experimental findings suggest that the anti-convulsant effects of OJe are likely mediated by both an inhibition of NMDA receptors at the glycine-binding site and an agonistic activity on benzodiazepine-binding site at GABAA receptors. This study provides evidences for the antiepileptic activity of OJe, and its results could be used as scientific basis for further researches aimed to develop novel complementary therapy for the treatment of epilepsy in a context of a multitarget pharmacological strategy.},

	abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma and stressor-related disorder that results in a prolonged stress response. It is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC). The only approved therapy for PTSD is selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but their efficacy is marginal. Recently, we demonstrated that over-production of norepinephrine (NE) as the possible reason for the lack of efficacy of SSRIs. Hence, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of PTSD. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory role of blueberries in modulating inflammatory markers and neurotransmitter levels in PTSD. Rats were fed either a blueberry enriched (2\%) or a control diet. Rats were exposed to cats for one hour on days 1 and 11 of a 31-day schedule to simulate traumatic conditions. The rats were also subjected to psychosocial stress via daily cage cohort changes. At the end of the study, the rats were euthanized and the PFC and HC were isolated. Monoamines were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), gene and protein expression levels of inflammatory cytokines were also measured. In our PTSD model, NE levels were increased and 5-HT levels were decreased when compared to control. In contrast, a blueberry enriched diet increased 5-HT without affecting NE levels. The rate limiting enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase were also studied and they confirmed our findings. The enhanced levels free radicals, gene and protein expression of inflammatory cytokines seen in the PTSD group were normalized with a blueberry enriched diet. Decreased anxiety in this group was shown by improved performance on the elevated plus-maze. These findings indicate blueberries can attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation and restore neurotransmitter imbalances in a rat model of PTSD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have confirmed the essential and paramount role of the L-Citrulline on the nitric oxide regulation and the endothelial function improvement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-over clinical trial, thirty patients, diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) and flow mediated dilation to nitroglycerin dependent vasodilation (FMD/NMD) ratio less than 1, were included. The patients were randomly divided into two groups of 15 patients and underwent treatment by L-Citrulline or placebo for 15 days, in 2 step protocol. The indicators of assessment in the current study were the ratio of the FMD/NMD and FMD value.
RESULTS: In the current cross-over clinical trial, the mean of FMD to NMD ratio and mean FMD value of all patients before starting the protocol were 0.91 ± 0.08 and 4.04 ± 0.51 mm, respectively. The final results of study showed that following L-Citrulline administration, mean FMD to NMD ratio and mean FMD value were enhanced to: 1.03 ± 0.09 and 4.96 ± 0.72 mm, respectively, which were statistically significant (P{\textless}0.001 and P{\textless}0.001, respectively). However, following placebo administration, mean FMD to NMD ratio and mean FMD value were receded to: 0.92 ± 0.09 and 4.06 ± 0.22 mm, respectively, which were not statistically significant (P = 0.75 and P = 0.89, respectively). Moreover, the improvement of mean FMD to NMD ratio (0.12 ± 0.02) and mean FMD value (0.92 ± 0.16 mm), following L-Citrulline administration, were statistically significant in comparison with the change of mean FMD to NMD ratio (0.01 ± 0.002) and mean FMD value (0.02 ± 0.003), following placebo administration (P{\textless}0.001 and P{\textless}0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: L-Citrulline treatment can lead to improvement of the endothelial function in patients diagnosed with CAD which are assessed via FMD to NMD ratio FMD value enhancements.},

We previously reported an increase of components, including novel triterpenoids, in ileal fluids of 11 ileostomates following consumption of raspberries using nontargeted LC-MSn techniques in combination with data deconvolution software. The current study focused on components that consistently decreased postsupplementation. After data deconvolution, 32 components were identified that met exclusion parameters of m/z signals and which decreased significantly in ileal fluids from eight of 11 participants post-raspberry supplementation. Two-thirds of these components were identified putatively from their MS properties. Consistent decreases were observed in components that possibly reflected "washing out" of presupplementation intake of common foods/drinks including (poly)phenol metabolites. Metabolites associated with fat metabolism such as hydroxylated fatty acids and cholate-type bile acids were specifically reduced. However, more directed re-examination of the data revealed that although some cholates were consistently reduced, the more polar glyco- and tauro-linked bile acid derivatives increased consistently, by as much as 100-fold over presupplementation levels. The possible reasons for these substantial alterations in bile acid composition in ileal fluids in response to raspberry intake are discussed.},

The LFO group consumed 300 mg LFO day-1 , whereas the placebo group consumed one placebo capsule every day for 16 weeks. We measured muscle mass, body fat percentage and the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure score at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter.
RESULTS: In the LFO group, muscle mass in the body trunk increased significantly after 16 weeks of LFO intake (+0.38 kg, P = 0.02). The trunk muscle mass weight of the LFO group increased significantly compared to that of the placebo group (P {\textless} 0.01). Furthermore, the body fat percentage and body trunk fat percentage of the LFO group were significantly suppressed compared to that of the placebo group (P = 0.03 and P {\textless} 0.01, respectively).

OBJECTIVES: To examine the capacity of lycopene-rich tomato nutrient complex (TNC) and lutein, to protect against ultraviolet (UV)A/B and UVA1 radiation at a molecular level.
METHODS: In a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized, crossover study two active treatments containing either TNC or lutein were assessed for their capacity to decrease the expression of UVA1 the radiation-inducible genes HO1, ICAM1 and MMP1. Sixty-five healthy volunteers were allocated to four treatment groups and subjected to a 2-week washout phase, followed by two 12-week treatment phases separated by another 2 weeks of washout. Volunteers started either with active treatment and were then switched to placebo, or vice versa. At the beginning and at the end of each treatment phase skin was irradiated and 24 h later biopsies were taken from untreated, UVA/B- and UVA1-irradiated skin for subsequent reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of gene expression. Moreover, blood samples were taken after the washout and the treatment phases for assessment of carotenoids.
RESULTS: TNC completely inhibited UVA1- and UVA/B-induced upregulation of heme-oxygenase 1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and matrix metallopeptidase 1 mRNA, no matter the sequence (anova, P {\textless} 0·05). In contrast, lutein provided complete protection if it was taken in the first period but showed significantly smaller effects in the second sequence compared with TNC.
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming the role of these genes as indicators of oxidative stress, photodermatoses and photoageing, these results might indicate that TNC and lutein could protect against solar radiation-induced health damage.},

We evaluated the relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor and the oxidation-related parameters as well as the patient's diabetic status, age, and sex. Vascular endothelial growth factor levels did not change significantly but O2 (•-) scavenging activity and total hydroperoxide level significantly (p{\textless}0.05) increased and decreased, respectively. Both pre- and post- astaxanthin intake, vascular endothelial growth factor and total hydroperoxide levels were positively correlated (Pearson: r = 0.42, p{\textless}0.05; r = 0.55, p{\textless}0.01, respectively). Analysis of vascular endothelial growth factor levels and O2 (•-) scavenging activities gave a negative correlation but only pre-astaxanthin intake (r = -0.37, p{\textless}0.05). Differences in levels pre- and post-astaxanthin only showed association between vascular endothelial growth factor and total hydroperoxide (r = 0.49, p{\textless}0.01) analyzed by multiple linear regression. Using multivariate analysis, pre-astaxanthin vascular endothelial growth factor level was associated with two factors of total hydroperoxide and O2 (•-) scavenging activity (r = 0.49, p{\textless}0.05), and post-astaxanthin vascular endothelial growth factor level with two factors of total hydroperoxide and sex (r = 0.60, p{\textless}0.01). Astaxanthin intake may have affected vascular endothelial growth factor level through its antioxidant effects by increasing O2 (•-) scavenging activity and suppressing peroxide production.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nonhuman studies suggest a protective effect of caffeine on cognition. Although human literature remains less consistent, reviews suggest a possible favorable relationship between caffeine consumption and cognitive impairment or dementia. We investigated the relationship between caffeine intake and incidence of cognitive impairment or probable dementia in women aged 65 and older from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study.
METHODS: All women with self-reported caffeine consumption at enrollment were included (N = 6,467). In 10 years or less of follow-up with annual assessments of cognitive function, 388 of these women received a diagnosis of probable dementia based on a 4-phase protocol that included central adjudication. We used proportional hazards regression to assess differences in the distributions of times until incidence of probable dementia or composite cognitive impairment among women grouped by baseline level of caffeine intake, adjusting for risk factors (hormone therapy, age, race, education, body mass index, sleep quality, depression, hypertension, prior cardiovascular disease, diabetes, smoking, and alcohol consumption).
RESULTS: Women consuming above median levels (mean intake = 261mg) of caffeine intake for this group were less likely to develop incident dementia (hazard ratio = 0.74, 95\% confidence interval [0.56, 0.99], p = .04) or any cognitive impairment (hazard ratio = 0.74, confidence interval [0.60, 0.91], p = .005) compared to those consuming below median amounts (mean intake = 64mg) of caffeine for this group.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest lower odds of probable dementia or cognitive impairment in older women whose caffeine consumption was above median for this group and are consistent with the existing literature showing an inverse association between caffeine intake and age-related cognitive impairment.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Previous population studies in evaluating the beneficial effects of capsaicin (CAP) have yielded inconclusive results, and the mechanisms responsible for possible benefit remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the effect of dietary CAP on metabolic and immune profiles and its potential associations with gut microbial patterns in healthy adults.
DESIGN: In a 6-week controlled feeding trial, subjects were given the weight maintenance diet sequentially contained with 0, 5, 0, and 10 mg/d CAP from chili powder.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in 12 healthy subjects enrolled in Third Military Medical University in Chongqing.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At the end of each period, anthropometric and basal metabolism measures together with blood and fecal samples were collected. Plasma metabolic and inflammatory markers and gut microbial ecology of each subject were subsequently assessed.
RESULT: Dietary CAP increased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and Faecalibacterium abundance, accompanied with increased plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide and decreased plasma ghrelin level. Further enterotype analysis revealed that these subjects could be clustered into Bacteroides enterotype (E1) and Prevotella enterotype (E2), and the above beneficial effects were mainly obtained in E1 subjects. Moreover, E1 subjects had significantly higher fecal Faecalibacterium abundance and butyrate concentration after CAP interventions than those in E2 subjects.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that gut enterotypes may influence the beneficial effects of dietary CAP, providing new evidence for the personalized nutrition guidance of CAP intervention on health promotion linking with gut microbiota patterns.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Allium sativum L. (A.S.) "garlic", one of the most interesting medicinal plants, has been suggested to contain compounds that could be beneficial in numerous pathological situations including cancer. In this work, we aimed to assess the immunomodulatory effect of A.S. preparation on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals.
METHODS: Nontoxic doses of A.S. were identified using MTT assay. Effects on CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocyte proliferation were studied using flow cytometry. The effect of A.S. on cytokine gene expression was studied using qRT-PCR. Finally, qualitative analysis of A.S. was performed by HPLC approach. Data were analyzed statistically by one-way ANOVA test.
RESULTS: The nontoxic doses of A.S. preparation did not affect neither spontaneous nor TCR-mediated CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocyte proliferation. Interestingly, A.S. exhibited a statistically significant regulation of IL-17 gene expression, a cytokine involved in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In contrast, the expression of IL-4, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was unaffected. Qualitative analysis of A.S. ethanol preparation indicated the presence of three polyphenol bioactive compounds, which are catechin, vanillic acid and ferulic acid.
CONCLUSION: The specific inhibition of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-17 without affecting cell proliferation in human PBMCs by the Allium sativum L. preparation suggests a potential valuable effect of the compounds present in this plant for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer, where IL-17 is highly expressed. The individual contribution of these three compounds to this global effect will be assessed.},

OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the effects of ginger (Zingiber officinale) on sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) in infertile men.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation was performed on 100 infertility treatment candidates who were admitted to Royan Institute for Reproductive Biomedicine, Tehran, Iran. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of two treatments: ginger and placebo. Patients were given a 3-month oral treatment (members received capsules containing 250 mg of ginger powder twice a day in ginger and a placebo in other group). Before and after treatment, standardized semen samples were obtained to determine sperm concentration, motility, and SDF according to World Health Organization.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between two groups regarding SDF at baseline (53.48. 95\%CI: 37.95-69.02) in cases and (56.75, 95\%CI: 40.01-73.5) in controls. The average positive percentage of SDF in patients receiving ginger (17.77, 95\%CI: 6.16-29.39) was lower compared with placebo (40.54, 95\%CI: 23.94-57.13) after three month of treatment (p=0.02). In multivariate analysis, SDF was significantly lower in patients receiving ginger compared with placebo (mean difference: 3.21, 95\%CI: 0.78-5.63, p=0.009). There were no significant differences between two groups regarding to semen parameters.
CONCLUSION: The present study has demonstrated that ginger in a controlled study of efficacy was effective in decreasing SDF in infertile men.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In official judo competitions, athletes usually engage in 5-7 matches in the same day, performing numerous high-intensity efforts interspersed by short recovery intervals. Thus, glycolytic demand in judo is high and acidosis may limit performance. Carnosine is a relevant intracellular acid buffer whose content is increased with beta-alanine supplementation. Thus, we hypothesized that beta-alanine supplementation could attenuate acidosis and improve judo performance.
DESIGN: Twenty-three highly-trained judo athletes were randomly assigned to receive either beta-alanine (6.4gday-1) or placebo (dextrose, same dosage) for 4 weeks.
METHODS: Performance was assessed before (PRE) and after (POST) supplementation through a 5-min simulated fight (randori) followed by 3 bouts of the Special Judo Fitness Test (SJFT). Blood samples were collected for blood pH, bicarbonate (HCO3-) and lactate determination.
RESULTS: Beta-alanine supplementation improved the number of throws per set and the total number of throws (both p{\textless}0.05). Placebo did not change these variables (both p{\textgreater}0.05). Blood pH and HCO3- reduced after exercise (all p{\textless}0.001), with no between-group differences (all p{\textgreater}0.05). However, the lactate response to exercise increased in the beta-alanine group as compared to placebo (p{\textless}0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, 4 weeks of beta-alanine supplementation effectively enhance judo-related performance in highly-trained athletes.},

Promising preclinical results have led to clinical evaluations in cancer patients or patients at increased risk for cancer development.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize clinical investigations targeting cancer or precancerous lesions with BRB and discuss future directions.
METHODS: A thorough literature search was conducted through December 1, 2015 to identify all published studies evaluating BRB in cancer focused clinical trials.
RESULTS: Research investigating BRB in clinical settings report positive effects on preneoplastic lesions or cancers of the oral cavity, esophagus and colon. BRB treatment resulted in: histologic regression of oral intraepithelial neoplasia associated with improved histologic grade and significantly reduced loss of heterozygosity at tumor suppressor gene loci, modulated genes linked to RNA processing and growth factor recycling; in the colon, BRB inhibited FAP-associated polyp progression, demethylated tumor suppressor genes and improved plasma cytokine profiles; in Barrett's patients, BRB consumption increased tissue levels of GST-pi and decreased 8-isoprostane, a marker of lipid peroxidation/oxidative stress.
CONCLUSIONS: The precise dose, duration and optimum mode of BRB delivery for cancer inhibition remains to be fully elucidated. Common themes across studies support that BRB are anti-proliferative, anti- inflammatory, reduce oxidative stress and restore tumor suppressive activity.

The role of CYP was assessed in human liver microsomes (HLM) and tyrosol-to-hydroxytyrosol conversion was observed. Screening with selective enzymatic CYP inhibitors identified CYP2A6 as the major isoform involved in this process. Studies with baculosomes further demonstrated that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 could transform tyrosol into hydroxytyrosol. Experiments using human genotyped livers showed an interindividual variability in hydroxytyrosol formation and supported findings that CYP2D6 and CYP2A6 mediated this reaction.

However, there is no convincing epidemiological, clinical or experimental evidence supporting FV chemopreventive ability.

Ten days post-treatment, the phase-I/II xenobiotic metabolizing and antioxidant enzyme activities, protein and mRNA levels were investigated. As a marker of oxidative stress, the level of hydroperoxides was measured in rat serum samples. Here we show that a blend of FV orally administered to rats not only potentially manipulates metabolism but also disrupts systemic oxidative homeostasis. A daily combination of the five servings remarkably down-regulates the catalytic activity, protein and mRNA levels of a cohort of hepatic metabolizing enzymes, suggesting a possible depressed clearance upon exposure to ubiquitous carcinogens. Strikingly, we observed an impairment of antioxidant enzymes with a boost in systemic hydroperoxide levels. Our study identifies new potential factors of cancer risk connected with the persistent consumption of fixed servings of FV, suggesting that dietary guidance should rely on a "daily diversification" of FV.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiometabolic profile is usually altered in obesity. Interestingly, the consumption of flavanol-rich foods might be protective against those metabolic alterations.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the postprandial cardiometabolic effects after the acute consumption of cocoa extract before and after 4 weeks of its daily intake. Furthermore, the bioavailability of cocoa extract was investigated.
DESIGN: Twenty-four overweight/obese middle-aged subjects participated in a 4-week intervention study. Half of the volunteers consumed a test meal enriched with 1.4 g of cocoa extract (415 mg flavanols), while the rest of the volunteers consumed the same meal without the cocoa extract (control group). Glucose and lipid profile, as well as blood pressure and cocoa metabolites in plasma, were assessed before and at 60, 120, and 180 min post-consumption, at the beginning of the study (Postprandial 1) and after following a 4-week 15\% energy-restricted diet including meals containing or not containing the cocoa extract (Postprandial 2).
RESULTS: In the Postprandial 1 test, the area under the curve (AUC) of systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly higher in the cocoa group compared with the control group (p=0.007), showing significant differences after 120 min of intake. However, no differences between groups were observed at Postprandial 2. Interestingly, the reduction of postprandial AUC of SBP (AUC\_Postprandial 2-AUC\_Postprandial 1) was higher in the cocoa group (p=0.016). Furthermore, cocoa-derived metabolites were detected in plasma of the cocoa group, while the absence or significantly lower amounts of metabolites were found in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: The daily consumption of cocoa extract within an energy-restricted diet for 4 weeks resulted in a greater reduction of postprandial AUC of SBP compared with the effect of energy-restricted diet alone and independently of body weight loss. These results suggest the role of cocoa flavanols on postprandial blood pressure homeostasis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota plays an important role in the development of obesity and obesity-associated impairments such as low-grade inflammation. Lingonberries have been shown to prevent diet-induced obesity and low-grade inflammation. However, it is not known whether the effect of lingonberry supplementation is related to modifications of the gut microbiota. The aim of the present study was to describe whether consumption of different batches of lingonberries alters the composition of the gut microbiota, which could be relevant for the protective effect against high fat (HF)-induced metabolic alterations.
METHODS: Three groups of C57BL/6J mice were fed HF diet with or without a supplement of 20\% lingonberries from two different batches (Lingon1 and Lingon2) during 11 weeks. The composition and functionality of the cecal microbiota were assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing and PICRUSt. In addition, parameters related to obesity, insulin sensitivity, hepatic steatosis, inflammation and gut barrier function were examined.
RESULTS: HF-induced obesity was only prevented by the Lingon1 diet, whereas both batches of lingonberries reduced plasma levels of markers of inflammation and endotoxemia (SAA and LBP) as well as modified the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota, compared to the HF control group. The relative abundance of Akkermansia and Faecalibacterium, genera associated with healthy gut mucosa and anti-inflammation, was found to increase in response to lingonberry intake.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that supplementation with lingonberries to an HF diet prevents low-grade inflammation and is associated with significant changes of the microbiota composition. Notably, the anti-inflammatory properties of lingonberries seem to be independent of effects on body weight gain.},

	abstract = {Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is important for brain function, and higher DHA intake is inversely correlated with relative risk of Alzheimer's disease. The potential benefits of DHA supplementation in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have not been fully examined. Our study aimed to determine the effect of DHA supplementation on cognitive function and hippocampal atrophy in elderly subjects with MCI. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Tianjin, China. 240 individuals with MCI aged 65 years and over were recruited and equalized randomly allocated to the DHA or the placebo group. Participants received 12-month DHA supplementation (2 g/day) or corn oil as placebo. Both global and specific subdomains of cognitive function and hippocampal volume were measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Both changes were analyzed by repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA). This trial has been registered: ChiCTR-IOR-15006058. A total of 219 participants (DHA: 110, Placebo: 109) completed the trial. The change in mean serum DHA levels was greater in the intervention group (+3.85\%) compared to the control group (+1.06\%). Repeated-measures analyses of covariance showed that, over 12 months, there was a significant difference in the Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (ηp2 = 0.084; p = 0.039), Information (ηp2 = 0.439; p = 0.000), and Digit Span (ηp2 = 0.375; p = 0.000) between DHA-treated versus the placebo group. In addition, there were significant differences in volumes of left hippocampus (ηp2 = 0.121, p = 0.016), right hippocampus (ηp2 = 0.757, p = 0.008), total hippocampus (ηp2 = 0.124, p = 0.023), and global cerebrum (ηp2 = 0.145, p = 0.032) between the two groups. These findings suggest that DHA supplementation (2 g/day) for 12 months in MCI subjects can significantly improve cognitive function and slow the progression of hippocampal atrophy. Larger, longer-term confirmatory studies are warranted.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Inflammation and oxidative damage contribute significantly to the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Postprandial oxidative stress and inflammation are characterized by an increased susceptibility of the organism toward oxidative damage after consumption of a meal rich in lipids and/or carbohydrates. Micronutrients modulate immune system and exert a protective action by reducing oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) level. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the postprandial plasma ox-LDL level and the gene expression of 13 genes related to oxidative stress (HOSp) and human inflammasome pathways (HIp), after a tocopherol-enriched Mediterranean meal (TEM), and a Western high-fat meal (HFM). Moreover, Mediterranean Adequacy Index was calculated to define the quality of both meals.
METHODS: We set up a randomized and crossover trial in healthy human volunteers. Ox-LDL level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the gene expression of 13 genes related to HOSp and HIp by qRT-PCR.
RESULTS: Ox-LDL levels significantly decreased comparing HFM versus TEM (p {\textless} 0.05). Percentages of significantly overexpressed genes after each dietary treatment are as follows: (A) baseline versus HFM: 7.69 \% HIp and 23.08 \% HOSp; (B) baseline versus TEM: 7.69 \% HIp and 7.69 \% HOSp; (C) HFM versus TEM: 15.38 \% HIp and 15.38 \% HOSp.
CONCLUSIONS: TEM reduced postprandial risk factors of CVD, such as ox-LDL, and the expression of inflammation and oxidative stress-related genes. Chronic studies on larger population are necessary before definitive conclusions.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that the bioflavonoid quercetin has anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects. We investigated the effect of quercetin supplementation on inflammation, disease severity, and clinical symptoms in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: The present study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which 50 women with RA were allocated into a quercetin (500 mg/day) or placebo group for 8 weeks. Plasma levels of high-sensitivity tumor necrosis factor-α (hs-TNFα), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), clinical symptoms including early morning stiffness (EMS), morning and after-activity pain, and tender (TSC) and swollen joint counts (SJC) were determined. Disease activity and functional disability were assessed by Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS-28), physician global assessment (PGA), and a health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) at the beginning and end of the study.
RESULTS: Quercetin supplementation for 8 weeks significantly reduced EMS, morning pain, and after-activity pain (p {\textless} 0.05). DAS-28 and HAQ scores decreased in the quercetin group compared to placebo and the number of patients with active disease significantly decreased in the quercetin group. Plasma hs-TNFα level was significantly reduced in the quercetin group compared to placebo (p {\textless} 0.05). There were no significant differences in TJC and SJC between groups but TJC significantly decreased in the quercetin group after the intervention. Supplementation had an effect on ESR but it was not significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Five hundred milligrams per day quercetin supplementation for 8 weeks resulted in significant improvements in clinical symptoms, disease activity, hs-TNFα, and HAQ in women with RA.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12944-016-0341-1},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The links between dietary fat intake, polyunsaturated fatty acid intake and breast cancer risk remain equivocal, with some studies pointing to improvements in risk upon omega-3 supplementation. However, the background diet is poorly controlled in most studies, potentially confounding this link. Therefore, this study examined the hypothesis that in order to see the benefits of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, the background diet must be low in fat.
METHODS: Of the 56 healthy, pre-menopausal women randomized to one of two experimental arms, consisting of a two-treatment, randomized, cross-over design, 41 completed the 10 month intervention. The two diet phases (habitual and low-fat) were separated by a washout phase, each lasting 3 menstrual cycles. During each diet phase, women were supplemented with 1.2 g eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid per day.
RESULTS: Red blood cell fatty acid composition indicated that more eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid was incorporated in the low-fat diet than the habitual diet, though both diet phases resulted in significant increases in the omega-3 to omega-6 ratio. In the context of omega-3 supplementation in breast cancer risk reduction, we also measured fatty acid incorporation into nipple aspirate fluid. Similar changes to red blood cells were noted in nipple aspirate fluid, with higher incorporation of eicosapentaenoic acid in the low-fat diet phase.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the total level of dietary fat has some direct impact on fatty acid partitioning in addition to the recognized importance of fatty acid ratios, and supports the hypothesis that dietary fat intake must be considered a confounder in supplementation trials. Additionally, we demonstrate that n3 supplementation both reaches and imparts improvements in lipid content and n3:n6 at the target breast tissue.

	abstract = {The gut microbiota has been established as an important player influencing many aspects of human physiology. Breast milk, the first diet for an infant, contains human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) that shape the infant's gut microbiota by selectively stimulating the growth of specific bacteria, especially bifidobacteria. In addition to their bifidogenic activity, the ability of HMO to modulate immune function and the gut barrier makes them prime candidates to restore a beneficial microbiota in dysbiotic adults and provide health benefits. We conducted a parallel, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, HMO-supplementation study in 100 healthy, adult volunteers, consuming chemically produced 2'-O-fucosyllactose (2'FL) and/or lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) at various daily doses and mixes or placebo for 2 weeks. All participants completed the study without premature discontinuation. Supplementation of 2'FL and LNnT at daily doses up to 20 g was shown to be safe and well tolerated, as assessed using the gastrointestinal symptoms rating scale. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis showed that HMO supplementation specifically modified the adult gut microbiota with the primary impact being substantial increases in relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Bifidobacterium in particular and a reduction in relative abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. This study provides the first set of data on safety, tolerance and impact of HMO on the adult gut microbiota. Collectively, the results from this study show that supplementing the diet with HMO is a valuable strategy to shape the human gut microbiota and specifically promote the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE Epidemiologic studies have suggested that higher intake of added sugar is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Few prospective studies have examined the association of added sugar intake with CVD mortality. OBJECTIVE To examine time trends of added sugar consumption as percentage of daily calories in the United States and investigate the association of this consumption with CVD mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 1988-1994 [III], 1999-2004, and 2005-2010 [n = 31,147]) for the time trend analysis and NHANES III Linked Mortality cohort (1988-2006 [n = 11 733]), a prospective cohort of a nationally representative sample of US adults for the association study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cardiovascular disease mortality. RESULTS Among US adults, the adjusted mean percentage of daily calories from added sugar increased from 15.7\% (95\% CI, 15.0\%-16.4\%) in 1988-1994 to 16.8\% (16.0\%-17.7\%; P = .02) in 1999-2004 and decreased to 14.9\% (14.2\%-15.5\%; P {\textless} .001) in 2005-2010. Most adults consumed 10\% or more of calories from added sugar (71.4\%) and approximately 10\% consumed 25\% or more in 2005-2010. During a median follow-up period of 14.6 years, we documented 831 CVD deaths during 163,039 person-years. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of CVD mortality across quintiles of the percentage of daily calories consumed from added sugar were 1.00 (reference), 1.09 (95\% CI, 1.05-1.13), 1.23 (1.12-1.34), 1.49 (1.24-1.78), and 2.43 (1.63-3.62; P {\textless} .001), respectively. After additional adjustment for sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics, HRs were 1.00 (reference), 1.07 (1.02-1.12), 1.18 (1.06-1.31), 1.38 (1.11-1.70), and 2.03 (1.26-3.27; P = .004), respectively. Adjusted HRs were 1.30 (95\% CI, 1.09-1.55) and 2.75 (1.40-5.42; P = .004), respectively, comparing participants who consumed 10.0\% to 24.9\% or 25.0\% or more calories from added sugar with those who consumed less than 10.0\% of calories from added sugar. These findings were largely consistent across age group, sex, race/ethnicity (except among non-Hispanic blacks), educational attainment, physical activity, health eating index, and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most US adults consume more added sugar than is recommended for a healthy diet. We observed a significant relationship between added sugar consumption and increased risk for CVD mortality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telomeres are repetitive nucleotide sequences (TTAGGG) and their associated proteins at the end of eukaryote chromosomes. Telomere length shortens throughout the lifespan with each cell division, and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is often used as a biomarker of cellular aging. LTL is related to many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, to our knowledge, the relation between LTL and risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes, such as dietary intake of processed meat and unprocessed red meat, is largely unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of processed meat intake and unprocessed red meat intake with LTL.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 2846 American Indians from the Strong Heart Family Study who participated in the 2001-2003 examination. Dietary factors, including past-year consumption of processed meat and unprocessed red meat, were assessed with the use of a 119-item Block Food-Frequency Questionnaire. LTL was measured with the use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the associations of intake of processed meat and unprocessed red meat with LTL.
RESULTS: Consumption of processed meat was negatively associated with LTL after adjustment for age, sex, site, education, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and other dietary factors. For every additional daily serving of processed meat, LTL was 0.021 units (telomeric product-to-single-copy gene ratio) shorter (β ± SE = -0.021 ± 0.008, P = 0.009). No association was observed between the intake of unprocessed red meat and LTL (β ± SE = 0.008 ± 0.011, P = 0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: In the Strong Heart Family Study, consumption of processed meat, but not unprocessed red meat, was associated with shorter LTL, a potential mediator for several age-related diseases. Further studies are needed to better understand the biological mechanism by which processed meat intake influences cellular aging.},

However, these studies have been hampered by poor designs, small sample sizes, short treatment duration, and similar intervention dosages. Furthermore, the antidepressant effects of combined curcumin and saffron administration are unknown.
METHODS: In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 123 individuals with major depressive disorder were allocated to one of four treatment conditions, comprising placebo, low-dose curcumin extract (250mg b.i.d.), high-dose curcumin extract (500mg b.i.d.), or combined low-dose curcumin extract plus saffron (15mg b.i.d.) for 12 weeks. The outcome measures were the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-rated version (IDS-SR30) and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).
RESULTS: The active drug treatments (combined) were associated with significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms compared to placebo (p=.031), and superior improvements in STAI-state (p{\textless}.001) and STAI-trait scores (p=.001). Active drug treatments also had greater efficacy in people with atypical depression compared to the remainder of patients (response rates of 65\% versus 35\% respectively, p=.012). No differences were found between the differing doses of curcumin or the curcumin/saffron combination.
LIMITATIONS: Investigations with larger sample sizes are required to examine the efficacy of differing doses of curcumin and saffron/curcumin combination. Its effects in people with atypical depression also require examination in larger scale studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Active drug treatments comprising differing doses of curcumin and combined curcumin/saffron were effective in reducing depressive and anxiolytic symptoms in people with major depressive disorder.},

	abstract = {SCOPE: The objective of this study was to interrogate two mechanisms by which commercial Carrageenans (E407) (CGN) may adversely affect human health: (i) Through modification of gastric proteolysis and (ii) Through affecting gut epithelial structure and function.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Three commercial CGN samples with distinct zeta-potentials (stable at the pH range of 3-7 and varied with physiological levels of CaCl2 ) were mixed with milk, soy or egg protein isolates, then subjected to a semi-dynamic in vitro digestion model and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. This revealed varying levels of interference with gastric digestive proteolysis and a significant decrease in pepsin activity. Further, a Caco-2 cell model was used to explore various effects of physiologically digested CGN (pdCGN) on various epithelial cell functions and characteristics. Samples of pdCGN (0.005-0.5 mg/mL) affected the epithelial barrier function, including redistribution of the tight-junction protein Zonula Occludens (Zo)-1, changes in cellular F-actin architecture and increased monolayer permeability to the transfer of macromolecules. Moreover, pdCGN induced elevation in the levels of the pro-inflammatory IL-8 receptor CXCR1.
CONCLUSION: This work raises the possibility that CGN may reduce protein and peptide bioaccessibility, disrupt normal epithelial function, promote intestinal inflammation, and consequently compromise consumer health.},

	abstract = {This study was a 14-day, outpatient, open-label randomized crossover trial of lyophilized black raspberries (BRBs) in older overweight or obese males to determine whether BRB consumption affects postprandial inflammation associated with consumption of a high-fat high-calorie (HFHC) meal. Ten study participants consumed 45 g/d of lyophilized BRBs for 4 days, followed by a HFHC breakfast plus BRBs on day 6 or consumed the HFHC breakfast on day 6 without previous consumption of BRBs and then crossed over to the other treatment after a 2-day washout period. Blood samples were obtained before and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours after consumption of the HFHC breakfast. The primary study outcomes were changes in area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). The secondary outcomes were safety and tolerability of lyophilized BRB powder. The chronology and values of measured serum concentrations for IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP were consistent with those described previously by other investigators. The AUC of serum IL-6 was lowered significantly (P = 0.03, n = 10) with BRB consumption (34.3 ± 7.6 pg·mL⁻¹·h⁻¹ compared with 42.4 ± 17.9 pg·mL⁻¹·h⁻¹ for consumption of the HFHC meal alone). However, no significant differences (change in AUC) were calculated for serum CRP and TNF-α. The findings of this pilot study suggest that consumption of lyophilized BRBs may attenuate postprandial inflammation in overweight or obese males consuming a HFHC meal. Further investigation of BRBs is warranted to better elucidate their inflammomodulatory potential.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the primary omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil, have been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the independent effects of EPA and DHA on lipid and apolipoprotein levels, as well as on inflammatory biomarkers of CVD risk, using doses often used in the general population.
DESIGN: A blinded, randomized 6-week trial was performed in 121 healthy, normolipidemic subjects who received olive oil placebo 6g/d, EPA 600mg/d, EPA 1800mg/d, or DHA 600mg/d. The EPA was derived from genetically modified yeast.
RESULTS: The subjects tolerated the supplements well with no safety issues; and the expected treatment-specific increases in plasma EPA and DHA levels were observed. Compared to placebo, the DHA group had significant decreases in postprandial triglyceride (TG) concentrations (-20\%, -52.2mg/dL, P=0.03), significant increases in fasting and postprandial low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (+18.4\%, 17.1mg/dL, P=0.001), with no significant changes in inflammatory biomarkers. No significant effects were observed in the EPA 600mg/d group. The high-dose EPA group had significant decreases in lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 concentrations (Lp-PLA2) (-14.1\%, -21.4ng/mL, P=0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effects of EPA 1800mg/d on CVD risk reduction may relate in part to the lowering of Lp-PLA2 without adversely affecting LDL-C. In contrast, DHA decreased postprandial TG, but raised LDL-C. Our observations indicate that these dietary fatty acids have divergent effects on cardiovascular risk markers.},

Intestinal permeability is found in many severe clinical situations and in common disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. In these conditions, substances that are normally unable to cross the epithelial barrier gain access to the systemic circulation. To illustrate the potential harmfulness of leaky gut, we present an argument based on examples linked to protein or lipid glycation induced by modern food processing. Increased intestinal permeability should be largely improved by dietary addition of compounds, such as glutamine or curcumin, which both have the mechanistic potential to inhibit the inflammation and oxidative stress linked to tight junction opening. This brief review aims to increase physician awareness of this common, albeit largely unrecognized, pathology, which may be easily prevented or improved by means of simple nutritional changes.},

We examined Sugar Research Foundation (SRF) internal documents, historical reports, and statements relevant to early debates about the dietary causes of CHD and assembled findings chronologically into a narrative case study. The SRF sponsored its first CHD research project in 1965, a literature review published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which singled out fat and cholesterol as the dietary causes of CHD and downplayed evidence that sucrose consumption was also a risk factor. The SRF set the review's objective, contributed articles for inclusion, and received drafts. The SRF's funding and role was not disclosed. Together with other recent analyses of sugar industry documents, our findings suggest the industry sponsored a research program in the 1960s and 1970s that successfully cast doubt about the hazards of sucrose while promoting fat as the dietary culprit in CHD. Policymaking committees should consider giving less weight to food industry-funded studies and include mechanistic and animal studies as well as studies appraising the effect of added sugars on multiple CHD biomarkers and disease development.},

This review summarizes current knowledge about the effect of curcumin on the regulation of histone deacetylases, histone acetyltransferases, DNA methyltransferase I, and miRNAs. How these changes lead to modulation of gene expression is also discussed. We also discuss other nutraceuticals which exhibit similar properties. The development of curcumin for clinical use as a regulator of epigenetic changes, however, needs further investigation to determine novel and effective chemopreventive strategies, either alone or in combination with other anticancer agents, for improving cancer treatment.},

Epidemiological and experimental studies have pointed toward maternal nutrition as a major player during prenatal development in influencing disease susceptibility later in life. Although the mechanisms underlying such observations are not well elucidated, epigenetic alterations of histones by particular maternal diets might be of central importance. Moreover, as much as dietary sources can influence epigenetic programming during pregnancy, they have started to be implicated in cancer chemoprevention, via the targeting of reversible epigenetic deregulations at the level of the histones.},

	abstract = {Calorie restriction without malnutrition, commonly referred to as dietary restriction (DR), results in a well-documented extension of life span. DR also produces significant, long-lasting improvements in biomarkers of metabolic health that begin to accrue soon after its introduction. The improvements are attributable in part to the effects of DR on energy balance, which limit fat accumulation through reduction in energy intake. Accumulation of excess body fat occurs when energy intake chronically exceeds the energy costs for growth and maintenance of existing tissue. The resulting obesity promotes the development of insulin resistance, disordered lipid metabolism, and increased expression of inflammatory markers in peripheral tissues. The link between the life-extending effects of DR and adiposity is the subject of an ongoing debate, but it is clear that decreased fat accumulation improves insulin sensitivity and produces beneficial effects on overall metabolic health. Over the last 20 years, dietary methionine restriction (MR) has emerged as a promising DR mimetic because it produces a comparable extension in life span, but surprisingly, does not require food restriction. Dietary MR also reduces adiposity but does so through a paradoxical increase in both energy intake and expenditure. The increase in energy expenditure fully compensates for increased energy intake and effectively limits fat deposition. Perhaps more importantly, the diet increases metabolic flexibility and overall insulin sensitivity and improves lipid metabolism while decreasing systemic inflammation. In this chapter, we describe recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms and effects of dietary MR and discuss the remaining obstacles to implementing MR as a treatment for metabolic disease.},

METHODS: Forty normal-weight young women were involved in this cross-sectional study. DNA was isolated from white blood cells, and CpG site methylation in TNF-α was analyzed by Sequenom EpiTyper. The quality of the diet was assessed by Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2005).
RESULTS: Contradicting our hypothesis, HEI-2005 score was negatively associated with CpG5 (r = -0.460, p = 0.003) and TNF-α total methylation (r = -0.355, p = 0.026). A higher intake of fruits was related to lower insulin, HOMA-IR, and TNF-α methylation. No other dietary pattern was related to TNF-α methylation. TNF-α total methylation correlated positively with systolic blood pressure (r = 0.323; p = 0.042) and CpG5 methylation with body mass index (r = 0.333, p = 0.036).

The WHO Cardiovascular Diseases and Alimentary Comparison Study demonstrated that dietary taurine and magnesium (Mg) intake suppresses cardiovascular diseases. We herein evaluate the effects of taurine and Mg supplementation on EPC function and oxidative stress in healthy men and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Healthy men received taurine (3 g per day) or Mg (340 mg per day) for 2 weeks. SHRs and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were housed with high-salt drinking water (1\% NaCl). The SHRs received 3\% taurine solution and/or a high-Mg (600 mg per 100 g) diet for 4 weeks. Their peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated to quantify EPC colony formation. Oxidative stress markers in their peripheral blood were evaluated using a free radical analytical system and a thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) assay. Taurine and Mg supplementation significantly increased EPC colony numbers and significantly decreased free radical levels and TBARS scores in healthy men. Taurine and Mg supplementation significantly increased EPC colony numbers and significantly decreased TBARS scores and free radical levels in SHRs. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase component mRNA expression was significantly higher in the renal cortex of salt-loaded SHRs than in WKY rats, in which it was suppressed by taurine and Mg supplementation. Taurine and Mg supplementation increased EPC colony formation in healthy men and improved impaired EPC function in SHRs through antioxidation, indicating that the dietary intake of taurine and Mg may prolong lifespan by preventing the progression of cardiovascular diseases.},

Participants were randomized to treatment and reported to the laboratory, after an overnight fast, on four occasions separated by at least one week. Participants were blinded to treatment meal and consumed one of four isoenergetic meals that provided: 1) 20 \% fat (control; olive oil) or 35 \% fat provided from 2) n-3 (ω3) (DHA = 500 mg; fish oil); 3) n-6 (ω6) (7.4 g; grapeseed oil) or 4) saturated fat (16 g; coconut oil). Baseline and postprandial blood samples were collected. Primary outcome was defined as the effect of treatment meal on postprandial endotoxemia. Serum was analyzed for metabolites, inflammatory markers, and endotoxin. Data from all 20 participants were analyzed using repeated-measures ANCOVA.
RESULTS: Participant serum endotoxin concentration was increased during the postprandial period after the consumption of the saturated fat meal but decreased after the n-3 meal (p {\textless} 0.05). The n-6 meal did not effect a different outcome in participant postprandial serum endotoxin concentration from that of the control meal (p {\textgreater} 0.05). There was no treatment meal effect on participant postprandial serum biomarkers of inflammation. Postprandial serum triacylglycerols were significantly elevated following the n-6 meal compared to the n-3 meal. Non-esterified fatty acids were significantly increased after consumption of the saturated fat meal compared to other treatment meals.
CONCLUSIONS: Meal fatty acid composition modulates postprandial serum endotoxin concentration in healthy adults. However, postprandial endotoxin was not associated with systemic inflammation in vivo.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was retrospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02521779 on July 28, 2015.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common disorder that can significantly affect patient quality of life. Previous studies have found that curcumin had anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and clinical benefits in cancer and asthma.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of curcumin in the treatment of AR and to explore the molecular mechanisms involved.
METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind study, 241 patients with AR received either placebo or oral curcumin for 2 months. The therapeutic effects of curcumin were evaluated by nasal symptoms and nasal airflow resistance. In addition, the production of interferon γ, interleukin (IL) 4, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor α from mononuclear cells and IL-8, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule, polyethylene glycol 2, and leukotriene C4 from polymorphonuclear neutrophils were compared before and after curcumin treatment.
RESULTS: Curcumin alleviated nasal symptoms (sneezing and rhinorrhea) and nasal congestion through reduction of nasal airflow resistance. Curcumin was found to exert diverse immunomodulatory effects, including suppression of IL-4, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor α and increased production of IL-10 and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule. However, curcumin did not affect the release of prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene C4 from polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study provides the first evidence of the capability of curcumin of improving nasal airflow and modulating immune response in patients with AR.},

The level of TNFα and MCP-1 in plasma, the content of TNFα in the liver, the insulin resistance index, inflammatory cell infiltration, hepatocyte apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and endoplasmic stress-associated protein expression were unaltered at 4 weeks. However, these levels were significantly elevated in HSHF fed rats at 12 weeks. At the same time, the level of endotoxin progressively increased from 0.08 ± 0.02 endotoxin EU/ml at week 4 to 0.7 ± 0.19 EU/ml at week 24. Moreover, these rats had elevated blood endotoxin levels, which were positively associated with their NASH indexes. Liver histology progressively worsened over the course of the study. However, we found that with concomitant treatment with glycine, the level of endotoxin decreased, while NASH indexes significantly decreased and liver status markedly improved,. These data support the hypothesis that glycine protects against NASH in rats by decreasing the levels of intestinal endotoxin, alleviating endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {Here the effect of glycine on intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cultured Kupffer cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was investigated to assess the possibility that they contain a glycine-gated chloride channel. LPS (10 micrograms/ml) increased [Ca2+]i rapidly, with peak values reaching 307 +/- 29 nM. Glycine (1 mM) prevented this increase nearly completely. Low concentrations of strychnine (1 microM), a glycine receptor antagonist, reversed the inhibitory effect of glycine completely; however, high concentrations of strychnine (1 mM) mimicked glycine. The effects of glycine and high-dose strychnine were prevented when cells were incubated in chloride-free buffer. Furthermore, potassium (25 mM) and LPS depolarized the Kupffer cell plasma membrane, whereas glycine caused hyperpolarization and prevented depolarization due to potassium and LPS. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production in cultured Kupffer cells due to LPS was decreased significantly by glycine. Therefore, it is concluded that Kupffer cells contain a glycine-gated chloride channel similar to that described previously in the central nervous system. Prevention of increases in [Ca2+]i due to LPS by activation of chloride influx reduced synthesis and release of toxic mediators by Kupffer cells.},

	abstract = {Citrulline (CIT) is an endogenous amino acid produced by the intestine. Recent literature has consistently shown CIT to be an activator of muscle protein synthesis (MPS). However, the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Our working hypothesis was that CIT might regulate muscle homeostasis directly through the mTORC1/PI3K/MAPK pathways. Because CIT undergoes both interorgan and intraorgan trafficking and metabolism, we combined three approaches: in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro. Using a model of malnourished aged rats, CIT supplementation activated the phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 in muscle. Interestingly, the increase in S6K1 phosphorylation was positively correlated (P {\textless} 0.05) with plasma CIT concentration. In a model of isolated incubated skeletal muscle from malnourished rats, CIT enhanced MPS (from 30 to 80\% CIT vs. Ctrl, P {\textless} 0.05), and the CIT effect was abolished in the presence of wortmannin, rapamycin, and PD-98059. In vitro, on myotubes in culture, CIT led to a 2.5-fold increase in S6K1 phosphorylation and a 1.5-fold increase in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Both rapamycin and PD-98059 inhibited the CIT effect on S6K1, whereas only LY-294002 inhibited the CIT effect on both S6K1 and 4E-BP1. These findings show that CIT is a signaling agent for muscle homeostasis, suggesting a new role of the intestine in muscle mass control.},

Complementary nonpharmaceutical strategies are needed to prevent and/or ameliorate dysregulation of glucose metabolism and prevent progression from normoglycemia to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes across the lifespan. Cocoa compounds, particularly the procyanidins, have shown promise for improving insulin sensitivity and blood glucose homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cocoa procyanidins exert these functions remain poorly understood. Furthermore, cocoa procyanidins exhibit size diversity, and evidence suggests that procyanidin bioactivity and size may be related. Here, we show that a procyanidin-rich cocoa extract elicits an antidiabetic effect by stimulating glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake, independent of insulin. Cocoa procyanidins did not appear to act via stimulation of AMPK or CaMKII activities. Additionally, in the presence of insulin, glycogen synthesis and AKT phosphorylation were affected. These mechanisms of action are most pronounced in response to oligomeric and polymeric procyanidins. These results demonstrate (1) specific mechanisms by which cocoa procyanidins improve glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and (2) that larger procyanidins appear to possess enhanced activities. These mechanistic insights suggest specific strategies and biological contexts that may be exploited to maximize the antidiabetic benefits of cocoa procyanidins.},

However, it is unknown whether chlorogenic acid-enriched Eucommia ulmoides Oliver bark has antidepressant potential through neuron protection, serotonin release promotion and penetration of blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. In the present study, we demonstrated that CGA could stimulate axon and dendrite growth and promote serotonin release through enhancing synapsin I expression in the cells of fetal rat raphe neurons in vitro. More importantly, CGA-enriched extract of E. ulmoides (EUWE) at 200 and 400 mg/kg/day orally administered for 7 days showed antidepressant-like effects in the tail suspension test of KM mice. Furthermore, we also found CGA could be detected in the the cerebrospinal fluid of the rats orally treated with EUWE and reach the level of pharmacological effect for neuroprotection by UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The findings indicate CGA is able to cross the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier to exhibit its neuron protection and promotion of serotonin release through enhancing synapsin I expression. This is the first report of the effect of CGA on promoting 5-HT release through enhancing synapsin I expression and CGA-enriched EUWE has antidepressant-like effect in vivo.

This double blind placebo controlled study evaluates the effects of cranberry consumption on PSA values and other markers in men with PCa before radical prostatectomy.
METHODS: Prior to surgery, 64 patients with prostate cancer were randomized to a cranberry or placebo group. The cranberry group (n=32) received a mean 30 days of 1500 mg cranberry fruit powder. The control group (n=32) took a similar amount of placebo. Selected blood/urine markers as well as free and total phenolics in urine were measured at baseline and on the day of surgery in both groups. Prostate tissue markers were evaluated after surgery.
RESULTS: The serum PSA significantly decreased by 22.5\% in the cranberry arm (n=31, P{\textless}0.05). A trend to down-regulation of urinary beta-microseminoprotein (MSMB) and serum gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, as well as upregulation of IGF-1 was found after cranberry supplementation. There were no changes in prostate tissue markers or, composition and concentration of phenolics in urine.
CONCLUSIONS: Daily consumption of a powdered cranberry fruit lowered serum PSA in patients with prostate cancer. The whole fruit contains constituents that may regulate the expression of androgen-responsive genes.},

Spermidine feeding failed to provide cardioprotection in mice that lack the autophagy-related protein Atg5 in cardiomyocytes. In Dahl salt-sensitive rats that were fed a high-salt diet, a model for hypertension-induced congestive heart failure, spermidine feeding reduced systemic blood pressure, increased titin phosphorylation and prevented cardiac hypertrophy and a decline in diastolic function, thus delaying the progression to heart failure.

	abstract = {Background
Knowing the levels of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) in different foods is of interest due to the association of these bioactive nutrients to health and diseases. There is a lack of relevant information on their contents in foods.

Objective
To develop a food polyamine database from published data by which polyamine intake and food contribution to this intake can be estimated, and to determine the levels of polyamines in Swedish dairy products.

Design
Extensive literature search and laboratory analysis of selected Swedish dairy products. Polyamine contents in foods were collected using an extensive literature search of databases. Polyamines in different types of Swedish dairy products (milk with different fat percentages, yogurt, cheeses, and sour milk) were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a UV detector.

Results
Fruits and cheese were the highest sources of putrescine, while vegetables and meat products were found to be rich in spermidine and spermine, respectively. The content of polyamines in cheese varied considerably between studies. In analyzed Swedish dairy products, matured cheese had the highest total polyamine contents with values of 52.3, 1.2, and 2.6 mg/kg for putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, respectively. Low fat milk had higher putrescine and spermidine, 1.2 and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively, than the other types of milk.

Conclusions
The database aids other researchers in their quest for information regarding polyamine intake from foods. Connecting the polyamine contents in food with the Swedish Food Database allows for estimation of polyamine contents per portion.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal injuries are the most common complaint in active populations. More than 50\% of all injuries in sports can be classified as sprains, strains, ruptures, or breaks of musculoskeletal tissues. Nutritional and/or exercise interventions that increase collagen synthesis and strengthen these tissues could have an important effect on injury rates.
OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine whether gelatin supplementation could increase collagen synthesis.
DESIGN: Eight healthy male subjects completed a randomized, double-blinded, crossover-design study in which they consumed either 5 or 15 g of vitamin C-enriched gelatin or a placebo control. After the initial drink, blood was taken every 30 min to determine amino acid content in the blood. A larger blood sample was taken before and 1 h after consumption of gelatin for treatment of engineered ligaments. One hour after the initial supplement, the subjects completed 6 min of rope-skipping to stimulate collagen synthesis. This pattern of supplementation was repeated 3 times/d with â‰¥6 h between exercise bouts for 3 d. Blood was drawn before and 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after the first exercise bout for determination of amino-terminal propeptide of collagen I content.
RESULTS: Supplementation with increasing amounts of gelatin increased circulating glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine, peaking 1 h after the supplement was given. Engineered ligaments treated for 6 d with serum from samples collected before or 1 h after subjects consumed a placebo or 5 or 15 g gelatin showed increased collagen content and improved mechanics. Subjects who took 15 g gelatin 1 h before exercise showed double the amino-terminal propeptide of collagen I in their blood, indicating increased collagen synthesis.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that adding gelatin to an intermittent exercise program improves collagen synthesis and could play a beneficial role in injury prevention and tissue repair. This trial was registered at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry as ACTRN12616001092482.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether resveratrol supplementation can improve insulin sensitivity and promote overall metabolic health on top of standard diabetes care.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seventeen subjects with well-controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D) were treated with placebo and 150 mg/day resveratrol (resVida) in a randomized double-blind crossover study for 30 days. The main outcome measure was insulin sensitivity by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique.
RESULTS: Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity were not affected by resveratrol treatment. Intrahepatic lipid content also remained unaffected by resveratrol; however, the change in intrahepatic lipid content correlated negatively with plasma resveratrol levels (R = -0.68, P = 0.03). Intramyocellular lipid content increased in type 2 muscle fibers (P = 0.03), and systolic blood pressure tended to decrease (P = 0.09) upon resveratrol treatment. In addition, resveratrol significantly improved ex vivo mitochondrial function (state 3 and state U respiration upon malate with octanoyl-carnitine, P {\textless} 0.005). Intriguingly, a correlation was found between plasma levels of a metabolite of resveratrol (dihydroresveratrol) and the metformin dose used by the patients (R = 0.66, P = 0.005), suggesting an interaction between metformin and resveratrol. It could be speculated that the lack of a resveratrol-induced insulin-sensitizing effect is caused by this interaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Resveratrol supplementation does not improve hepatic or peripheral insulin sensitivity. Our results question the generalized value of resveratrol as an add-on therapy in the treatment of T2D and emphasize the need to perform studies in drug-naive patients with T2D or subjects with prediabetes.},

	abstract = {Vitamin K is essential for the posttranslational modifications of blood coagulation factors and proteins present in the bone matrix. Vitamin K is distributed not only in the liver and bones but is also abundant in the brain, kidney, and gonadal tissues. However, the function of extra-hepatic/bone vitamin K has not been fully elucidated. Previously, we observed that dietary supplementation with vitamin K suppresses inflammation, and vitamin K deficiency decreases testicular testosterone production in rats. Here, we examined whether the dietary vitamin K state affects testicular steroidogenesis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated rats because vitamin K has anti-inflammatory activity. Male Wistar rats were fed either vitamin K-free or control diets for 35 d, and then intraperitoneally administered LPS (0.5 mg kg(-1) body weight) to induce inflammation for 6 h. Vitamin K deficiency symptoms were not observed in the vitamin K-free diet group; however, the vitamin K levels in the testis were significantly lower in the vitamin K-free diet group than in the control diet group. After LPS treatment, plasma testosterone levels were significantly reduced in the vitamin K-free diet group compared with the control diet group. Testicular mRNA and protein levels of Cyp11a, a rate-limiting enzyme in steroidogenesis, corresponded to plasma testosterone levels. However, plasma luteinizing hormone levels were unaffected by diet and LPS. Phosphorylated nuclear factor ÎºB p65 in the testis was significantly increased in the LPS-treated, vitamin K-free diet group compared with control. These results indicate that dietary vitamin K affects testicular vitamin K levels and ameliorates the LPS-induced reduction in testicular testosterone synthesis. Testicular vitamin K might facilitate the inhibition of inflammation signal transduction and maintain steady levels of testosterone.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic intensive exercise is associated with a greater induction of oxidative stress and with an excess of endogenous advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Curcumin can reduce the accumulation of AGEs in vitro and in animal models. We examined whether supplementation with curcumin and Boswellia serrata (BSE) gum resin for 3 months could affect plasma levels of markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and glycation in healthy master cyclists.
METHODS: Forty-seven healthy male athletes were randomly assigned to Group 1, consisting of 22 subjects given a Mediterranean diet (MD) alone (MD group), and Group 2 consisted of 25 subjects given a MD plus curcumin and BSE (curcumin/BSE group). Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total AGE, soluble receptor for AGE (sRAGE), malondialdehyde (MDA), plasma phospholipid fatty acid (PPFA) composition, and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were tested at baseline and after 12 weeks.
RESULTS: sRAGE, NEFA, and MDA decreased significantly in both groups, while only the curcumin/BSE group showed a significant decline in total AGE. Only the changes in total AGE and MDA differed significantly between the curcumin/BSE and MD groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a positive effect of supplementation with curcumin and BSE on glycoxidation and lipid peroxidation in chronically exercising master athletes.},

We aimed to assess plasma omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA status in relation to all-cause mortality in an Australian community-based study. We hypothesized that omega-3 PUFA would be inversely associated, and omega-6 PUFA positively associated with all-cause mortality. Plasma phospholipid omega-3 (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], docosapentaenoic acid [DPA], docosahexaenoic acid, α-linolenic acid, and total) and omega-6 PUFAs (linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and total) were measured among 1008 adults (44\% men) in 1996. Plasma PUFA composition was quantified using gas chromatography. During 17-year follow-up, 98 men and 81 women died. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, plasma EPA was inversely associated with all-cause mortality overall (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per 1-SD increase, 0.81; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.95), in men (HR, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.62-0.98), and in women (HR, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.65-0.94), separately.

No omega-6 PUFAs were significantly associated with mortality. Our findings of reduced all-cause mortality in men and women who have high EPA in plasma, and in men with high plasma DPA and α-linolenic acid, partially support our hypothesis that omega-3 PUFAs help reduce mortality but provide no evidence that omega-6 PUFAs may increase mortality.},

Forty-nine men aged 30-65 years with chronic insomnia symptoms were randomized into diet (n = 28) or control (n = 21) groups. The diet group underwent a six-month individualized diet intervention with three face-to-face counseling sessions and online supervision 1-3 times per week; 300-500 kcal/day less energy intake and optimized nutrient composition were recommended. Controls were instructed to maintain their habitual lifestyle. Sleep parameters were determined by piezoelectric bed sensors, a sleep diary, and a Basic Nordic sleep questionnaire. Compared to the controls, the diet group had shorter objective sleep onset latency after intervention. Within the diet group, prolonged objective total sleep time, improved objective sleep efficiency, lower depression score, less subjective nocturnal awakenings, and nocturia were found after intervention. In conclusion, modest energy restriction and optimized nutrient composition shorten sleep onset latency in overweight and obese men with insomnia symptoms.},

A total of 26 postmenopausal women (mean age ± standard deviation 64±12 years) were randomly assigned to two groups with different cocoa-intake frequencies: one group ingested 17 g of cocoa once daily except on Sundays (every-day group, n=13), and the other ingested 17 g of cocoa twice daily every other day (every-other-day group, n=13). These intake regimens were maintained in both groups for 12 weeks. Carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity and femoral-ankle pulse-wave velocity were measured in both groups at baseline and again at the end of the 12-week study period. Compared to baseline, both pulse-wave velocities had significantly decreased after the 12-week study period in both groups (P{\textless}0.05). However, no significant difference in degree of change was observed between the two groups.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The regulation of protein turnover in skeletal muscle is essential for the maintenance of integrity, growth, and function of this tissue. We recently reported that glycine enhances skeletal muscle growth in young pigs. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted with a mouse myoblast cell line, C2C12, to test the hypothesis that glycine activates protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (Akt/mTOR), as well as inhibits 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the expression of genes for proteolysis.
METHODS: C2C12 myoblasts were cultured with 0, 0.25 (physiologic concentration in mouse plasma), 0.5, or 1.0 mmol glycine/L. Cell proliferation, activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), AMPK signaling, mRNA levels of atrogin-1 and muscle-specific ring finger protein 1 (MuRF1), and protein synthesis and degradation were measured in the absence or presence of an Akt inhibitor, LY294002, or an AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR).
RESULTS: Compared with control cells, 0.25-1.0 mmol glycine/L enhanced cell growth (by 12-15\%) after 24 h (P {\textless} 0.05). Glycine treatment led to increased DNA replication (by 70-80\%) while enhancing mTORC1 activation by upregulating Akt and inhibiting AMPK signaling (P {\textless} 0.05). Accordingly, glycine exposure increased (P {\textless} 0.05) the rate of protein synthesis (by 20-80\%) and inhibited (P {\textless} 0.05) the rate of protein degradation (by 15-30\%) in a concentration-dependent manner in C2C12 cells. These observations were validated by the use of an Akt inhibitor, LY294002, or an AMPK activator, AICAR. Moreover, glycine addition resulted in decreased mRNA levels for atrogin-1 and MuRF1 (by 20-40\% and 30-50\%, respectively; P {\textless} 0.05). The repressing effect of glycine on the expression of MuRF1, instead of atrogin-1, was abolished by LY294002 (P {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that glycine plays a previously unrecognized role in enhancing protein synthesis and inhibiting protein degradation in C2C12 cells. Glycine regulates protein turnover by activating mTORC1 and by inhibiting the expression of genes for proteolysis. Our results indicate that glycine is a functional amino acid that improves muscle cell growth.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chitosan is a dietary fibre which acts by reducing fat absorption and thus used as a means for controlling weight. Weight loss clinical trial outcomes, however, have contradictory results regarding its efficacy. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a chitosan from fungal origin in treatment of excess weight in the absence of dietary restrictions.
METHODS: A phase IV, randomised, multicentre, single-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study was conducted by administering chitosan capsules (500 mg, five/day) and indistinguishable placebo capsules as daily supplements to 96 overweight and obese subjects for 90 days. The study participants were divided in 2:1 ratio to receive either chitosan (n = 64) or placebo (n = 32). Efficacy was assessed by measuring body weight, body composition parameters, anthropometric measurements, HbA1C level and lipid profile at day 45 and day 90. Also, short form-36 quality of life (QoL) questionnaire was assessed to evaluate improvement in life-style and dietary habits were recorded for calorie intake. Safety was assessed by evaluating safety parameters and monitoring adverse events.
RESULTS: The mean changes in body weight were -1.78 ± 1.37 kg and -3.10 ± 1.95 kg at day 45 and day 90 respectively in chitosan group which were significantly different (p {\textless} 0.0001) as compared to placebo. BMI was decreased by10.91 fold compared to placebo after 90 day administration. In concert with this, there was also reduction in body composition and anthropometric parameters together with improvement in QoL score. Chitosan was also able to reduce HbA1C levels (below 6 \%) in subjects who had initial higher values. The mean caloric intake shows that there was no change in dietary habits of subjects in both groups. Lipid levels were unaffected and all adverse events were mild in nature and unrelated to study treatment.
CONCLUSION: Chitosan from fungal origin was able to reduce the mean body weight up to 3 kg during the 90 day study period. Together with this, there was also improvement in body composition, anthropometric parameters and HbA1C, reflecting overall benefits for the overweight individuals. Additionally, there was also improvement in QoL score. It was safe and well tolerated by all subjects.

	abstract = {SCOPE: The pomegranate lipid-lowering properties remain controversial, probably due to the interindividual variability in polyphenol (ellagitannins) metabolism.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed at investigating whether the microbially derived ellagitannin-metabolizing phenotypes, i.e. urolithin metabotypes A, (UM-A), B (UM-B), and 0 (UM-0), influence the effects of pomegranate extract (PE) consumption on 18 cardiovascular risk biomarkers in healthy overweight-obese individuals.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A double-blind, crossover, dose-response, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. The study (POMEcardio) consisted of two test phases (dose-1 and dose-2, lasting 3 weeks each) and a 3-week washout period between each phase. Forty-nine participants (BMI {\textgreater} 27 kg/m2 ) daily consumed one (dose-1, 160 mg phenolics/day) or four (dose-2, 640 mg phenolics/day) PE or placebo capsules. Notably, UM-B individuals showed the highest baseline cardiovascular risk. After dose-2, total cholesterol (-15.5 ± 3.7\%), LDL-cholesterol (-14.9 ± 2.1\%), small LDL-cholesterol (-47 ± 7\%), non-HDL-cholesterol (-11.3 ± 2.5\%), apolipoprotein-B (-12 ± 2.2\%), and oxidized LDL-cholesterol -24 ± 2.5\%) dose dependently decreased (P {\textless} 0.05) but only in UM-B subjects. These effects were partially correlated with urolithin production and the increase in Gordonibacter levels. Three (50\%) nonproducers (UM-0) became producers following PE consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: UM clustering suggests a personalized effect of ellagitannin-containing foods and could explain the controversial pomegranate benefits. Research on the specific role of urolithins and the microbiota associated with each UM is warranted.},

	abstract = {SCOPE: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is an important biomarker of aging. This study examined whether inflammatory potential of diet, as measured by the Dietary Inflammatory IndexTM (DII) has an impact on telomere shortening in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We also carried out validation of the DII with C-reactive protein (CRP).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Data came from NHANES 1999-2002. LTL and CRP were assayed from leukocyte DNA and serum specimens, respectively. The DII was calculated from food intakes assessed using 24-h dietary recalls and expressed per 1000 calories consumed. Associations were examined using survey-based multivariable linear regression for log-transformed LTL. After multivariable adjustment, higher DII scores (i.e. relatively more pro inflammatory) were associated with shorter LTL both when used as continuous (b  =  -0.003; 95\% confidence interval [CI]  =  -0.005, -0.0002) and as quartiles (bDIIquartile4vs1   =  -0.013; 95\% CI  =  -0.025, -0.001; Ptrend   =  .03). In this same sample the DII also was associated with CRP ≥3 mg/L (ORDIIcontinuous = 1.10; 95\% CI = 1.06, 1.16).
CONCLUSION: In these NHANES data there was an association between DII and LTL. This study also provided a successful construct validation of the DII using CRP in a nationally representative sample. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that diet-associated inflammation determines LTL.},

The use of topical drugs, which are able to reduce mucosal inflammation and to improve healing tissues, can represent a relevant therapeutic advance. Topical sodium hyaluronate (SH) has recently been recognized as adjuvant treatment in the chronic inflammatory disease of the UADT.
AIMS: The aim of our work was to review the published literature regarding all the potential therapeutic effects of SH in the chronic inflammatory disease of UADT.
METHODS: Relevant published studies were searched in Pubmed, Google Scholar, Ovid using keywords ("sodium hyaluronate" and "upper airways") or Medical Subject Headings.
RESULTS: At the end of our selection process, sixteen publications have been included. Six of them in the post-operative period of nasal-sinus surgery, 2 of them in pediatric patients affected by recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, 4 of them in reducing symptoms and preventing exacerbations of chronic upper airways in adult population, 4 of them in patients with chronic inflammatory disease of UADT, including gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).
CONCLUSIONS: Topical administration of SH plays a pivotkey role in the postoperative phase of patients undergoing FESS and nasal surgery, and positive results are generally observed in all the patients suffering from UADT chronic inflammatory disease.},

Strategies that can restore or improve the clearance function hold great promise in delaying or preventing the onset of AD. Here, we show that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), by use of fat-1 transgenic mice and oral administration of fish oil, significantly promote interstitial Aβ clearance from the brain and resist Aβ injury. Such beneficial effects were abolished in Aqp4-knockout mice, suggesting that the AQP4-dependent glymphatic system is actively involved in the promoting the effects of n-3 PUFAs on the clearance of extracellular Aβ. Imaging on clarified brain tissues clearly displayed that n-3 PUFAs markedly inhibit the activation of astrocytes and protect the AQP4 polarization in the affected brain region after Aβ injection. The results of the present study prove a novel mechanism by which n-3 PUFAs exert protective roles in reducing Aβ accumulation via mediating the glymphatic system function.-Ren, H., Luo, C., Feng, Y., Yao, X., Shi, Z., Liang, F., Kang, J.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: It is well known that the carotenoids lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) improve eye health and an accumulating evidence base suggests cognitive benefits as well. The present study investigated underlying neural mechanisms using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It was hypothesized that lower L and Z concentrations would be associated with neurobiological inefficiency (i.e., increased activation) during cognitive performance.
METHODS: Forty-three community-dwelling older adults (mean age=72 years; 58\% female; 100\% Caucasian) were asked to learn and recall pairs of unrelated words in an fMRI-adapted paradigm. L and Z levels were measured in retina (macular pigment optical density) and serum using validated procedures.
RESULTS: Following first-level contrasts of encoding and retrieval trials minus control trials (p{\textless}.05, family-wise error corrected, minimum voxel cluster=8), L and Z were found to significantly and negatively relate to blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal in central and parietal operculum cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, planum polare, frontal and middle temporal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, postcentral gyrus, precentral gyrus, occipital cortex bilaterally, and cerebellar regions.
CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, the present study represents the first attempt to investigate neural mechanisms underlying the relation of L and Z to cognition using fMRI. The observed results suggest that L and Z promote cognitive functioning in old age by enhancing neural efficiency. (JINS, 2017, 23, 11-22).},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the effects of a marine oil extract (PCSO-524®) on inattention, hyperactivity, mood and cognition in children and adolescents. PCSO-524® is a standardised lipid extract of the New Zealand green-lipped mussel and is an inflammatory modulator that inhibits the 5'-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways and decreases concentrations of the pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid (AA).
METHODS: PCSO-524® or a matched placebo was administered for 14 weeks to 144 participants (123 males/21 females; mean age 8.7 years) with high hyperactivity and inattention in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The primary outcome was the Conners Parent Rating Scale assessing parental reports of behavioural problems. Secondary outcomes assessed changes in cognition and mood.
RESULTS: The results of the present study did not support the hypothesis that PCSO-524® improves parental reports of hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity in children ages 6 to 14 years over placebo. Repeated measures ANOVA on post hoc subsample analysis indicated significant improvements in hyperactivity (p = 0.04), attention (p = 0.02), learning (p = 0.05) and probability of ADHD (p = 0.04) with a medium to large average effect size (d = 0.65) in those children who did not meet criteria for combined hyperactivity and inattention. Furthermore, significant improvements in the PCSO-524® group were indicated in a whole sample repeated measures ANCOVA on recognition memory between baseline and week 8 over placebo (p = 0.02, d = 0.56); this difference was not sustained at week 14.
CONCLUSIONS: The results presented indicate that PCSO-524® may be beneficial in reducing levels of hyperactivity and inattention in a population of children with clinical and subclinical symptoms of ADHD.},

Here, we describe a double-blinded placebo (PBO)-controlled trial, in which gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy male volunteers (n = 29) were analysed to identify genes that responded to OLE, following an eight-week intervention with 20 mL daily consumption of either OLE or PBO. Differences between groups were determined using an adjusted linear model. Subsequent analyses indicated downregulation of genes important in inflammatory pathways, lipid metabolism and cancer as a result of OLE consumption. Gene expression was verified by real-time PCR for three genes (EGR1, COX-2 and ID3). The results presented here suggest that OLE consumption may result in health benefits through influencing the expression of genes in inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Future studies with a larger study group, including male and female participants, looking into direct effects of OLE on lipid metabolism and inflammation are warranted.},

However, there are limited studies to evaluate their regulatory effects on genes/proteins that relate to CRC oncogenesis in human subjects, such as selenoproteins, WNT signalling pathway, inflammation and methylation. This study examined the effects of supplementation of Se using Brazil nuts and green tea extract (GTE) capsules, alone and in combination, on targeted biomarkers. In total, thirty-two volunteers ({\textgreater}50 years of age) with plasma Se≤1·36 µmol/l were randomised to one of three treatment groups: nine to Se (approximately 48 µg/d) as six Brazil nuts, eleven to four GTE capsules (800 mg (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate) and twelve to a combination of Brazil nuts and GTE. Blood and rectal biopsies were obtained before and after each intervention. Plasma Se levels, rectal selenoprotein P (SePP) and β-catenin mRNA increased significantly in subjects consuming Brazil nuts alone or in combination, whereas rectal DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) and NF-κB mRNA were reduced significantly in subjects consuming GTE alone or in combination. None of the interventions significantly affected rectal acetylated histone H3 or Ki-67 expression at the protein level or plasma C-reactive protein. Effects of the combination of Brazil nuts and GTE did not differ from what would be expected from either agent alone. In conclusion, supplementation of Brazil nuts and/or GTE regulates targeted biomarkers related to CRC oncogenesis, specifically genes associated with selenoproteins (SePP), WNT signalling (β-catenin), inflammation (NF-κB) and methylation (DNMT1). Their combination does not appear to provide additional effects compared with either agent alone.},

Participants (n = 133, 65-80 years) experiencing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were randomized in a double-blind 6-month clinical trial to either blueberry or placebo. A reference group with no MCI received no treatment. The mean (SD) SUA at baseline were 5.45 (0.9), 6.4 (1.3) and 5.8 (1.4) mg/dL in reference, placebo, and treatment groups, respectively. Baseline SUA was different in men and women (6.25 (1.1) vs. 5.35 (1.1), p = 0.001). During the first three months, SUA decreased in the blueberry group and was significantly different from the placebo group in both men and women (p {\textless} 0.0003). Sex-specific differences became apparent after 3 months, when only men showed an increase in SUA in the blueberry group and not in the placebo (p = 0.0006) between 3 and 6 months. At 6 months SUA had rebounded in both men and women and returned to baseline levels. Baseline SUA was correlated with CVD risk factors, waist circumference and triglycerides (p {\textless} 0.05), but differed by sex. Overall, 6 m SUA changes were negatively associated with triglycerides in men, but not in women. Group-wise association between 6 m SUA changes and CVD risk factors showed associations with diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in women of the Blueberry group but not in men or any sex in the placebo group.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Cardiac health is a determinant of athletic performance. A body of data suggests that in healthy young adults, an increase in maximal cardiac output leads to an increase in endurance. Terminalia arjuna (TA) has been studied for multiple benefits in cardiovascular health although its effects as a cardioprotective ergogenic aid require further exploration. The current trial was planned to study the effect of the proprietary TA extract (E-OJ-01) on the markers of cardiac conditioning in healthy young adults.
STUDY QUESTION: No study has assessed the effect of TA extract on cardiac conditioning by improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in young exercising individuals.
STUDY DESIGN, MEASURES AND OUTCOMES: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of E-OJ-01 for use as an ergogenic supplements in young exercising adults. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02207101) and reported according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) requirements. Thirty-two healthy males, aged 18-40 years performing regular endurance exercise, were randomly assigned to 400 mg of E-OJ-01 or placebo for 56 days. LVEF, right and left ventricular Myocardial Performance Index, and Borg Rated Perceived Exertion (RPE) were assessed at baseline, day 28, and day 56; creatine kinase-MB and troponin-T were assessed at baseline and at day 56.
RESULTS: As compared with placebo, 56 days of E-OJ-01 supplementation significantly improved the LVEF (P = 0.0001) and decreased the right ventricular Myocardial Performance Index (P = 0.001). The fatigue level captured by Borg Scale after completion of exercise showed a greater decrease in the E-OJ-01 group as compared with placebo. Creatine kinase-MB and troponin-T did not change significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: TA (E-OJ-01) significantly increased cardiovascular efficiency and improved the cardiac conditioning in young healthy adults.},

	abstract = {The majority of studies on possible roles for collagen hydrolysates in human health have focused on their effects on bone and skin. Hydroxyprolyl-glycine (Hyp-Gly) was recently identified as a novel collagen hydrolysate-derived dipeptide in human blood. However, any possible health benefits of Hyp-Gly remain unclear. Here, we report the effects of Hyp-Gly on differentiation and hypertrophy of murine skeletal muscle C2C12Â cells. Hyp-Gly increased the fusion index, the myotube size, and the expression of the myotube-specific myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and tropomyosin structural proteins. Hyp-Gly increased the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K in myoblasts, whereas the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 inhibited their phosphorylation by Hyp-Gly. LY294002 and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin repressed the enhancing effects of Hyp-Gly on MyHC and tropomyosin expression. The peptide/histidine transporter 1 (PHT1) was highly expressed in both myoblasts and myotubes, and co-administration of histidine inhibited Hyp-Gly-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K in myoblasts and myotubes. These results indicate that Hyp-Gly can induce myogenic differentiation and myotube hypertrophy and suggest that Hyp-Gly promotes myogenic differentiation by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, perhaps depending on PHT1 for entry into cells.},

	abstract = {The recent discovery that genetically modified α cells can regenerate and convert into β-like cells in vivo holds great promise for diabetes research. However, to eventually translate these findings to human, it is crucial to discover compounds with similar activities. Herein, we report the identification of GABA as an inducer of α-to-β-like cell conversion in vivo. This conversion induces α cell replacement mechanisms through the mobilization of duct-lining precursor cells that adopt an α cell identity prior to being converted into β-like cells, solely upon sustained GABA exposure. Importantly, these neo-generated β-like cells are functional and can repeatedly reverse chemically induced diabetes in vivo. Similarly, the treatment of transplanted human islets with GABA results in a loss of α cells and a concomitant increase in β-like cell counts, suggestive of α-to-β-like cell conversion processes also in humans. This newly discovered GABA-induced α cell-mediated β-like cell neogenesis could therefore represent an unprecedented hope toward improved therapies for diabetes.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects on serum insulin and serum thyroid profile of a dietary supplement, myo-inositol, given alone or in combination with melatonin to women during menopausal transition.
METHODS: Forty women aged 45-55 years and at least 6 months of amenorrhea were enrolled in this study. They were randomly assigned to two groups of 20 each. One group took myo-inositol (myo-Ins) (2 g twice a day) and the other group took 2 g/d myo-Ins plus 3 g/d melatonin before sleeping. At the beginning of the study and after 6 months, all women were evaluated for the following indices: waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, endometrial thickness, as well as serum concentrations of TSH, FT3, FT4 and insulin.
RESULTS: Both at baseline and at 6 months, the two groups were statistically similar for each of the considered indices. If percent changes (Δ\%, 6 months over baseline) are contrasted in the two groups, serum TSH decreased in the myo-Ins group but increased in the latter, while serum insulin decreased in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of myo-Ins plus melatonin seems to affect positively glucose metabolism, while myo-Ins only seems to improve thyroid function.},

This study aimed to assess the effect of two weeks synbiotic supplementation on intestinal permeability under basal and stressed conditions. Secondary aims were the assessment of two weeks synbiotic supplementation on systemic immune function and gastrointestinal symptoms including defecation pattern.
DESIGN: Twenty healthy adults completed a double-blind, controlled, randomized, parallel design study.
INTERVENTION: Groups either received synbiotic (1.5 × 1010 CFU Ecologic® 825 + 10 g fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS P6) per day) or control supplements for two weeks.
OUTCOMES: Intestinal segment specific permeability was assessed non-invasively by oral administration of multiple sugar probes and, subsequently, assessing the excretion of these probes in urine. This test was conducted at baseline and at the end of intervention, in the absence and in the presence of an indomethacin challenge. Indomethacin was applied to induce a compromised gut state. Plasma zonulin, cytokines and chemokines were measured at baseline and at the end of intervention. Gastrointestinal symptoms and stool frequency were recorded at baseline and daily during intervention.
RESULTS: Significantly more male subjects were in the synbiotic group compared to the control group (P = 0.025). Indomethacin significantly increased urinary lactulose/rhamnose ratio versus without indomethacin, both in the control group (P = 0.005) and in the synbiotic group (P = 0.017). Urinary sugar recoveries and ratios, plasma levels of zonulin, cytokines and chemokines, and gastrointestinal symptom scores were not significantly different after control or synbiotic intervention. Stool frequency within the synbiotic group was significantly increased during synbiotic intervention compared to baseline (P = 0.039) and higher compared to control intervention (P = 0.045).
CONCLUSION: Two weeks Ecologic® 825/FOS P6 supplementation increased stool frequency, but did not affect intestinal permeability neither under basal nor under indomethacin-induced stressed conditions, immune function or gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy adults.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is becoming increasingly evident that platelet chemokines are involved in distinct aspects of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of long-term supplementation with purified anthocyanins on platelet chemokines in hypercholesterolemic individuals and to identify correlations of decreased platelet chemokine levels with serum lipid and inflammatory marker levels.
METHODS: A total of 146 hypercholesterolemic individuals were recruited and treated with 320 mg of purified anthocyanins (n = 73) or a placebo (n = 73) daily for 24 weeks in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
RESULTS: Anthocyanin supplementation for 24 weeks significantly decreased the plasma CXCL7 (-12.32\% vs. 4.22\%, P = 0.001), CXCL5 (-9.95\% vs. 1.93\%, P = 0.011), CXCL8 (-6.07\% vs. 0.66\%, P = 0.004), CXCL12 (-8.11\% vs. 5.43\%, P = 0.023) and CCL2 levels (-11.63\% vs. 12.84\%, P = 0.001) compared with the placebo. Interestingly, the decreases in the CXCL7 and CCL2 levels were both positively correlated with the decreases in the serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels after anthocyanin supplementation for 24 weeks. The decrease in the CXCL8 level was negatively correlated with the increase in the how-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) level and was positively correlated with the decrease in the soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) level in the anthocyanin group. In addition, a positive correlation was observed between the decreases in the CXCL12 and tumornecrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels after anthocyanin supplementation. However, the plasma CXCL4L1, CXCL1, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and human plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) levels did not significantly change following anthocyanin supplementation.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study supports the notion that platelet chemokines are promising targets of anthocyanins in the prevention of atherosclerosis.

We aimed to determine the mechanism underlying the nutritional effects of oleuropein and OA on interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) in rats with high-fat (HF) diet-induced obesity by examining the agonistic activity of oleuropein and OA toward the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). Four-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an HF (palm oil 30\% wt:wt) diet alone or with oleuropein (HF-O, 1 g/kg diet) for 28 days. In rats fed HF-O compared to HF, urinary noradrenaline, adrenaline and UCP1 levels in IBAT were significantly higher, whereas plasma leptin levels and the total weight of the abdominal cavity adipose tissue were significantly lower. In anaesthetized 7-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats, the OA (3.8 mg of intravenous injection)-induced increase in plasma noradrenaline secretion was suppressed by TRPA1 or TRPV1 antagonist and by a β2- or β3-adrenoceptor antagonist. Furthermore, OA-activated rat and human TRPV1s expressed on HEK293 cells at the same level as zingerone (pungent component in ginger). OA also activated humanTRPA1, and its potency was approximately 10-fold stronger than that for TRPV1. These findings suggest that OA is the agonist of both TRPA1 and TRPV1 and that OA enhances UCP1 expression in IBAT with a concomitant decrease in the visceral fat mass of HF-diet-induced obese rats through enhanced noradrenaline secretion via β-adrenergic action following TRPA1 and TRPV1 activation.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: In a short-term human intervention study, we determined the effects of coffee intake on DNA integrity during 8 h. Healthy male subjects ingested coffee in 200 mL aliquots every second hour up to a total volume of 800 mL. Blood samples were taken at baseline, immediately before the first coffee intake and subsequently every 2 h, prior to the respective coffee intake. DNA integrity was assayed by the comet assay. The results show a significant (p {\textless} 0.05) reduction of background DNA strand breaks already 2 h after the first coffee intake. Continued coffee intake was associated with further decrements in background DNA damage within the 8 h intervention (p {\textless} 0.01 and p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). Mean tail intensities (TIs\%) decreased from 0.33 TI\% (baseline, 0 h) to 0.22 TI\% (within 8 h coffee consumption).
CONCLUSION: Repeated coffee consumption was associated with reduced background DNA strand breakage, clearly measurable as early as 2 h after first intake resulting in a cumulative overall reduction by about one-third of the baseline value.},

We aimed to assess the effect of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in extending the rt-PA treatment window in this clinical trial among stroke patients.
METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned according to their onset-to-treatment time (OTT) and were then treated with rt-PA simultaneously with EGCG or placebo. Treatment outcome was assessed by the National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) and plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and 9.
RESULTS: Administration of EGCG significantly improved treatment outcomes of patients in the delayed OTT strata, as evidenced by improved NIHSS scores. This improved treatment outcome was likely attributed to reduction in plasma levels of both MMP-2 and 9, as indicated by strong linear correlations between both MMPs and NIHSS scores in all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Epigallocatechin gallate could potentially be used as a supplement of traditional rt-PA treatment among stroke patients, particularly those with delayed OTT, to extend the otherwise narrow therapeutic window and improve the outcome in late stroke treatment.},

The effect of WPI was compared to soy protein isolate (SPI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this randomized controlled cross-over intervention trial, 56 subclinically vitamin B12 -deficient participants received 50 g WPI or 50 g SPI as a control for 8 wk followed by 16-wk washout phase and then cross-over to alternative supplement for next 8 wk. Consumption of WPI resulted in significant increase in serum active B12 (p {\textless} 0.0001) and serum folate (p = 0.0094). MMA, HCY, and nucleoplasmic bridges increased significantly after SPI intake but not after WPI (p = 0.052; p = 0.028; p = 0.0009, respectively).

RESULTS: Antinociception, but not sedative or gastric injury response, was observed in a significant and dose-dependent manner with the BSE (50-500 mg kg-1, i.p. and 500-2000 mg kg-1, p.o.) in comparison to the control group; these effects resembled those observed with the analgesic tramadol (30 mg kg-1, i.p.) in writhing and formalin assessments. Blockage of opioid receptors by naloxone (1 mg kg-1, i.p.) produced partial inhibition of the antinociceptive effect of the BSE in both assays.

Additionally, we discuss the detection of specific metabolites by MS in different phases of their journey from the cereal to the target organs and excretion.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have sought to explore the impact of dietary Pi intake on human age related health in the pSoBid cohort (n=666) to explain the disparity between health and deprivation status in this cohort. As hyperphosphataemia is a driver of accelerated ageing in rodent models of progeria we tested whether variation in Pi levels in man associate with measures of biological ageing and health.
RESULTS: We observed significant relationships between serum Pi levels and markers of biological age (telomere length (p=0.040) and DNA methylation content (p=0.028), gender and chronological age (p=0.032). When analyses were adjusted for socio-economic status and nutritional factors, associations were observed between accelerated biological ageing (telomere length, genomic methylation content) and dietary derived Pi levels among the most deprived males, directly related to the frequency of red meat consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated ageing is associated with high serum Pi levels and frequency of red meat consumption. Our data provide evidence for a mechanistic link between high intake of Pi and age-related morbidities tied to socio-economic status.},

Once thought to be the inert, end-products of endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO) heme-oxidation, nitrate and nitrite are now considered major sources of exogenous NO that exhibit enhanced vasoactive signaling activity under conditions of hypoxia and stress. The bioavailability of nitrate and nitrite depend on the enzymatic reduction of nitrate to nitrite by a unique set of bacterial nitrate reductase enzymes possessed by specific bacterial populations in the mammalian mouth and gut. The pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (PH), obesity, hypertension and CVD are linked to defects in NO signaling, suggesting a role for commensal oral bacteria to shape the development of PH through the formation of nitrite, NO and other bioactive nitrogen oxides. Oral supplementation with inorganic nitrate or nitrate-containing foods exert pleiotropic, beneficial vascular effects in the setting of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, ischemia-reperfusion injury and in pre-clinical models of PH, while traditional high-nitrate dietary patterns are associated with beneficial outcomes in hypertension, obesity and CVD. These observations highlight the potential of the microbiome in the development of novel nitrate- and nitrite-based therapeutics for PH, CVD and their risk factors.},

The pharmacological depletion of senescent cells (SCs) with a "senolytic agent", a small molecule that selectively kills SCs, is a potential novel therapeutic approach for these diseases. Recently, we discovered ABT-263, a potent and highly selective senolytic agent, by screening a library of rationally-selected compounds. With this screening approach, we also identified a second senolytic agent called piperlongumine (PL). PL is a natural product that is reported to have many pharmacological effects, including anti-tumor activity. We show here that PL preferentially killed senescent human WI-38 fibroblasts when senescence was induced by ionizing radiation, replicative exhaustion, or ectopic expression of the oncogene Ras. PL killed SCs by inducing apoptosis, and this process did not require the induction of reactive oxygen species. In addition, we found that PL synergistically killed SCs in combination with ABT-263, and initial structural modifications to PL identified analogs with improved potency and/or selectivity in inducing SC death. Overall, our studies demonstrate that PL is a novel lead for developing senolytic agents.},

	doi = {10.3945/ajcn.116.140046},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cocoa flavanol intake, especially that of (-)-epicatechin, has been linked to beneficial effects on human cardiovascular function. However, cocoa also contains the methylxanthines theobromine and caffeine, which may also affect vascular function.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether an interaction between cocoa flavanols and methylxanthines exists that influences cocoa flavanol-dependent vascular effects.
DESIGN: Test drinks that contained various amounts of cocoa flavanols (0-820 mg) and methylxanthines (0-220 mg), either together or individually, were consumed by healthy volunteers (n = 47) in 4 different clinical studies-3 with a randomized, double-masked crossover design and 1 with 4 parallel crossover studies. Vascular status was assessed by measuring flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), brachial pulse wave velocity (bPWV), circulating angiogenic cells (CACs), and blood pressure before and 2 h after the ingestion of test drinks.
RESULTS: Although cocoa flavanol intake increased FMD 2 h after intake, the consumption of cocoa flavanols with methylxanthines resulted in a greater enhancement of FMD. Methylxanthine intake alone did not result in statistically significant changes in FMD. Cocoa flavanol ingestion alone decreased bPWV and diastolic blood pressure and increased CACs. Each of these changes was more pronounced when cocoa flavanols and methylxanthines were ingested together. It is important to note that the area under the curve of the plasma concentration of (-)-epicatechin metabolites over time was higher after the co-ingestion of cocoa flavanols and methylxanthines than after the intake of cocoa flavanols alone. Similar results were obtained when pure (-)-epicatechin and the methylxanthines theobromine and caffeine were consumed together.
CONCLUSION: A substantial interaction between cocoa flavanols and methylxanthines exists at the level of absorption, in which the methylxanthines mediate an increased plasma concentration of (-)-epicatechin metabolites that coincides with enhanced vascular effects commonly ascribed to cocoa flavanol intake. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02149238.},

	abstract = {SCOPE: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a type of incretin secreted from enteroendocrine L-cells. Our previous studies demonstrated that curcumin (a yellow pigment of turmeric) significantly increases the secretion of GLP-1 in enteroendocrine L cell line (GLUTag cells). However, it is not clear whether its action in vivo directly enhances GLP-1 secretion, which then leads to a reduction in blood glucose levels via the stimulation of insulin secretion. In addition, the molecular target of curcumin-induced GLP-1 secretion has not been clarified.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Glucose tolerance was significantly improved in rats after pre-administered curcumin (1.5 mg/kg) followed by intraperitoneal glucose injections via the stimulation of GLP-1 secretion and the induction of insulin secretion. In GLUTag cells, curcumin-induced GLP-1 secretion was associated with G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 40/120. Furthermore, the glucose-lowering effect induced by curcumin was significantly reduced after the administration of a GPR40/120 antagonist in rats.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the biological function of curcumin as a GLP-1 secretagogue and the possible molecular target that mediates GLP-1 secretion. Increases in the secretion of endogenous GLP-1 induced by curcumin may allow the dosages of other diabetic medicines to be reduced and aid in the prevention of diabetes.},

	abstract = {Cruciferous vegetables contain the bio-active compound sulforaphane (SF) which has been reported to protect individuals against various diseases by a number of mechanisms, including activation of the phase II detoxification enzymes. In this study, we show that the extracts of five cruciferous vegetables that we commonly consume and SF activate human salivary aldehyde dehydrogenase (hsALDH), which is a very important detoxifying enzyme in the mouth. Maximum activation was observed at 1 μg/ml of cabbage extract with 2.6 fold increase in the activity. There was a {\textasciitilde}1.9 fold increase in the activity of hsALDH at SF concentration of ≥ 100 nM. The concentration of SF at half the maximum response (EC50 value) was determined to be 52 ± 2 nM. There was an increase in the Vmax and a decrease in the Km of the enzyme in the presence of SF. Hence, SF interacts with the enzyme and increases its affinity for the substrate. UV absorbance, fluorescence and CD studies revealed that SF binds to hsALDH and does not disrupt its native structure. SF binds with the enzyme with a binding constant of 1.23 x 107 M-1. There is one binding site on hsALDH for SF, and the thermodynamic parameters indicate the formation of a spontaneous strong complex between the two. Molecular docking analysis depicted that SF fits into the active site of ALDH3A1, and facilitates the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. SF being an antioxidant, is very likely to protect the catalytic Cys 243 residue from oxidation, which leads to the increase in the catalytic efficiency and hence the activation of the enzyme. Further, hsALDH which is virtually inactive towards acetaldehyde exhibited significant activity towards it in the presence of SF. It is therefore very likely that consumption of large quantities of cruciferous vegetables or SF supplements, through their activating effect on hsALDH can protect individuals who are alcohol intolerant against acetaldehyde toxicity and also lower the risk of oral cancer development.},

It is an extensively used traditional Chinese herbal medicine in the clinical practice of traditional Chinese medicine, to treat headache, migraine, dizziness, epilepsy, infantile convulsion, tetany and so on. The present paper reviews the advancements in investigation of botany and ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and quality control of Gastrodia elata Blume. Finally, the possible tendency and perspective for future investigation of this plant are also put forward.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The information on Gastrodia elata Blume was collected via piles of resources including classic books about Chinese herbal medicine, and scientific databases including Pubmed, Google Scholar, ACS, Web of science, ScienceDirect databases, CNKI and others. Plant taxonomy was validated by the databases "The Plant List", and "Mansfeld's Encyclopedia".
RESULTS: Over 81 compounds from this plant have been isolated and identified, phenolics and polysaccharides are generally considered as the characteristic and active constituents of Gastrodia elata Blume. Its active compounds possess wide-reaching biological activities, including sedative, hypnotic, antiepileptic, anticonvulsive, antianxietic, antidepressant, neuroprotective, antipsychotic, anti-vertigo, circulatory system modulating, anti-inflammationary, analgesic, antioxidative, memory-improving and antiaging, antivirus and antitumor effects.
CONCLUSION: Despite the publication of various papers on Gastrodia elata Blume, there is still, however, the need for definitive research and clarification of other bioactive compounds using bioactivity-guided isolation strategies, and the possible mechanism of action as well as potential synergistic or antagonistic effects of multi-component mixtures derived from Gastrodia elata Blume need to be evaluated. It is also necessary and important to do more quality control and toxicological study on human subjects in order to maintain its efficacy stable in the body and validate its safety in clinical uses. In addition, more investigations on other parts of this plant beyond the tubers are needed. Further studies on Gastrodia elata Blume will lead to the development of new drugs and therapeutics for various diseases, and how to utilize it better should be paid more attention to.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Polyphenol intake has been linked to improvements in human vascular function, although data on hydroxycinnamates, such as chlorogenic acid (CGA) have not yet been studied. We aimed to investigate the impact of coffee intake rich in chlorogenic acid on human vascular function and whether CGAs are involved in potential effects.
METHODS: Two acute randomized, controlled, cross-over human intervention trials were conducted. The impact of coffee intake, matched for caffeine but differing in CGA content (89, and 310 mg) on flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was assessed in 15 healthy male subjects. In a second intervention trial conducted with 24 healthy male subjects, the impact of pure 5-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA), the main CGA in coffee (5-CQA; 450 mg and 900 mg) on FMD was also investigated.
RESULTS: We observed a bi-phasic FMD response after low and high polyphenol, (89 mg and 310 mg CGA) intake, with increases at 1 (1.10 ± 0.43\% and 1.34 ± 0.62\%, respectively) and 5 (0.79\% ± 0.32 and 1.52\% ± 0.40, respectively) hours post coffee consumption. FMD responses to coffee intake was closely paralleled by the appearance of CGA metabolites in plasma, notably 3-, 4- and 5-feruloylquinic acid and ferulic-4'-O-sulfate at 1 h and isoferulic-3'-O-glucuronide and ferulic-4'-O-sulfate at 5 h. Intervention with purified 5-CQA (450 mg) also led to an improvement in FMD response relative to control (0.75 ± 1.31\% at 1 h post intervention, p = 0.06) and concomitant appearance of plasma metabolites.
CONCLUSIONS: Coffee intake acutely improves human vascular function, an effect, in part, mediated by 5-CQA and its physiological metabolites.

	abstract = {Uptake of inorganic nitrate (NO3-) into the salivary circulation is a rate-limiting step for dietary NO3- metabolism in mammals. It has been suggested that salivary NO3- uptake occurs in competition with inorganic iodide (I-). Therefore, this study tested the hypothesis that I- supplementation would interfere with NO3- metabolism and blunt blood pressure reductions after dietary NO3- supplementation. Nine healthy adults (4 male, mean ± SD, age 20 ± 1 yr) reported to the laboratory for initial baseline assessment (control) and following six day supplementation periods with 140 mL·day-1 NO3--rich beetroot juice (8.4 mmol NO3-·day-1) and 198 mg potassium gluconate·day-1 (nitrate), and 140 mL·day-1 NO3--rich beetroot juice and 450 μg potassium iodide·day-1 (nitrate + iodide) in a randomized, cross-over experiment. Salivary [I-] was higher in the nitrate + iodide compared to the control and NIT trials (P {\textless} 0.05). Salivary and plasma [NO3-] and [NO2-] were higher in the nitrate and nitrate + iodide trials compared to the control trial (P {\textless} 0.05). Plasma [NO3-] was higher (474 ± 127 vs. 438 ± 117 μM) and the salivary-plasma [NO3-] ratio was lower (14 ± 6 vs. 20 ± 6 μM), indicative of a lower salivary NO3- uptake, in the nitrate + iodide trial compared to the nitrate trial (P {\textless} 0.05). Plasma and salivary [NO2-] were not different between the nitrate and nitrate + iodide trials (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Systolic blood pressure was lower than control (112 ± 13 mmHg) in the nitrate (106 ± 13 mmHg) and nitrate + iodide (106 ± 11 mmHg) trials (P {\textless} 0.05), with no differences between the nitrate and nitrate + iodide trials (P {\textgreater} 0.05). In conclusion, co-ingesting NO3- and I- perturbed salivary NO3- uptake, but the increase in salivary and plasma [NO2-] and the lowering of blood pressure were similar compared to NO3- ingestion alone. Therefore, increased dietary I- intake, which is recommended in several countries worldwide as an initiative to offset hypothyroidism, does not appear to compromise the blood pressure reduction afforded by increased dietary NO3- intake.},

Results indicated that BAE, particularly at 1.0 g/kg, improved ECG and decreased cytokine levels in PM2.5-exposed rats. These changes were accompanied by an increase in interleukin 10 levels and superoxide dismutase activity in heart tissue and Bcl-2 protein expression, as well as a decrease in interleukin 6, malondialdehyde, endothelin 1, and angiotensin II levels and a reduction in Bax protein expression. This study demonstrates that BAE at certain doses can protect the cardiovascular system from PM2.5-induced damage.},

Cerebrovascular responses, cognitive performance and blood pressure were assessed at baseline and 1, 2, 3 and 5 h following consumption. There were significant differences in concentrations of total Hb and oxygenated Hb during the task period 1 h after MC consumption (P≤0·05). Furthermore, MC consumption significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (P≤0·05) over a period of 3 h, with peak reductions of 6±2 mmHg at 1 h after MC consumption relative to the placebo. Cognitive function and mood were not affected. These results show that a single dose of MC concentrate can modulate certain variables of vascular function; however, this does not translate to improvements in cognition or mood.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIM: Lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPC) are known to be a pathological component of oxidized-LDL, and several studies demonstrate its pro-inflammatory properties in vitro. Nevertheless, bioactive compounds found in coffee, such as phenolic acids might inhibit LDL oxidation. The relationship between coffee consumption and lysoPC has not been described previously in humans. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between coffee intake and plasma lysoPC levels in adults.
METHODS: Data was from the "Health Survey of Sao Paulo (ISA-Capital)", a cross-sectional population-based survey in Sao Paulo, among 169 individuals aged 20 years or older. This population was categorized into three groups: non-coffee consumers (0 mL/day-G1), low coffee consumers (≤100 mL/day-G2), and high coffee consumers ({\textgreater}100 mL/day-G3). Usual coffee intake was estimated by two 24HR and one FFQ, using Multiple Source Method. Quantification of the metabolites was performed by mass spectrometry (FIA-MS/MS and HPLC-MS/MS) and 14 lysoPC species were identified. The association between coffee intake and lysoPC was analyzed by multiple linear regression adjusted for age, sex, household per capita income, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, total energy intake, use of drugs, vegetables and fruit consumption and caffeine intake.
RESULTS: LysoPC levels were significantly lower in G3 than in G1, for the lysoPC a C16:1 (β = -0.56; p = 0.014), lysoPC a C18:1 (β = -2.57; p = 0.018), and lysoPC a C20:4 (β = -1.14; p = 0.037). In opposition, the ratios of C16:0/C16:1 and C18:0/18:1 was higher in G3 (β = 5.04; p = 0.025 and β = 0.28; p = 0.003, respectively).
CONCLUSION: LysoPC profile differed according to coffee intake, showing a possible beneficial health effect of this beverage on inflammatory and oxidative processes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) plays an important role in vascular biology, and influences aspects of age-dependent atherosclerosis. In animals, the sirtuin system is strongly influenced by resveratrol and caloric restriction, but its expression in humans is controversial. This study investigated the effects of resveratrol and caloric restriction on Sirt1 serum concentrations and vascular biomarkers in a healthy human population.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-eight healthy participants (24 women) aged 55-65years were randomized to either 30days of resveratrol administration (500mg/day) or caloric restriction (1000cal/day). Blood was collected at baseline and day 30. Laboratory data analyzed were triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, VLDL, LDL, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein (a), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), glucose, insulin, oxidative stress, C-reactive protein, and Sirt1. Expression of the Sirt1 gene was analyzed using real-time PCR. Caloric restriction diminished the abdominal circumference and improved the lipid profile, but not resveratrol intervention. Resveratrol and caloric restriction increased serum concentrations of Sirt1, from 1.06±0.71 to 5.75±2.98ng/mL; p{\textless}0.0001, and from 1.65±1.81 to 5.80±2.23ng/mL; p{\textless}0.0001, respectively. Sirt1 increased in women and men in both interventions. On the other hand expression of Sirt1 mRNA was not different after caloric restriction and resveratrol treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Caloric restriction and resveratrol significantly increased plasma concentrations of Sirt1. The long-term impact of these interventions on atherosclerosis should be assessed.},

Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADES) are formed by natural compounds, and can be considered as future solvents being especially useful for the preparation of nutraceuticals and food-grade extracts. In this paper various NADES were prepared using sugars, aminoacids and organic acids. Rutin (quercetin-3-O-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6))-β-d-glucopyranose) was used as a model compound to study NADES. Moreover, the effect of various eutectic mixtures on rutin's water solubility was studied. Proline/glutamic acid (2:1) and proline/choline chloride (1:1) mixtures have a solubility comparable to ethanol. The proline/glutamic acid (2:1) eutectic containing rutin was used in a pharmacokinetic study in Balb/c mice while bioavailability was compared to oral dosing of water suspension. Plasmatic levels of rutin were measured by HPLC-MS/MS showing increased levels and longer period of rutin permanence in plasma of NADES treated animals.

	abstract = {Garlic has the charisma of a potent remedy and holds its repute of a therapeutic panacea since the dawn of civilization. An integrated approach was adopted to evaluate the genetic diversity among Chinese garlic cultivars for their antifungal potency as well as allicin content distribution and, furthermore; a bioassay was performed to study the bio-stimulation mechanism of aqueous garlic extracts (AGE) in the growth and physiology of cucumber (Cucumis sativus). Initially, 28 garlic cultivars were evaluated against four kinds of phytopathogenic fungi; Fusarium oxysporum, Botrytis cinerea, Verticillium dahliae and Phytophthora capsici, respectively. A capricious antifungal potential among the selected garlic cultivars was observed. HPLC fingerprinting and quantification confirmed diversity in allicin abundance among the selected cultivars. Cultivar G025, G064, and G074 had the highest allicin content of 3.98, 3.7, and 3.66 mg g(-1), respectively, whereas G110 was found to have lowest allicin content of 0.66 mg g(-1). Cluster analysis revealed three groups on the basis of antifungal activity and allicin content among the garlic cultivars. Cultivar G025, G2011-4, and G110 were further evaluated to authenticate the findings through different solvents and shelf life duration and G025 had the strongest antifungal activity in all conditions. minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration of Allicin aqueous standard (AAS) and AGE showed significant role of allicin as primary antifungal substance of AGE. Leaf disk bioassay against P. capsici and V. dahliae to comparatively study direct action of AGE and AAS during infection process employing eggplant and pepper leaves showed a significant reduction in infection percentage. To study the bioactivity of AGE, a bioassay was performed using cucumber seedlings and results revealed that AGE is biologically active inside cucumber seedlings and alters the defense mechanism of the plant probably activating reactive oxygen species at mild concentrations. However, at higher concentrations, it might cause lipid peroxidation and membrane damage which temper the growth of cucumber seedlings. At the outcome of the study, an argument is advanced that current research findings provide bases for cultivar selection in antifungal effectivity as well as genetic variability of the cultivars. Allicin containing AGE can be used in specialized horticultural situations such as plastic tunnel and organic farming as a bio-stimulant to enhance cucumber growth and attenuate fungal degradation of agricultural produce.},

Although the mechanisms that mediate such improvements are currently unclear, animal and human trial data suggest that changes in neurotrophin expression, and related signalling apparatus, may be involved. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the link between changes in serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and changes in human cognitive performance following flavonoid intake. METHODS: The relationship between serum levels of BDNF and age, gender, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure and cognition at baseline, and following flavonoid intake, was investigated in two distinct randomised, controlled clinical trials. Trial 1 was conducted in men and women (aged 26-70 y; consuming an average of 3 portions of fruit and vegetables per day) and delivered high-flavonoid ({\textgreater}15 mg/100 g) or low-flavonoid ({\textless}5 mg/100 g) fruit and vegetables and increased intake by 2 portions every 6 weeks. The control arm was habitual diet over the same time frame. Trial 2 was conducted in an older males and female cohort (aged 62-75 y) intervening with a high-flavanol cocoa drink (494 mg total flavanols) and a low-flavanol cocoa drink (23 mg total flavanols) for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Serum BDNF levels increased linearly to the age of 65, after which BDNF levels were found to decrease markedly. All other physiological and anthropometric measurements proved to not be significantly associated with serum BDNF levels (p {\textgreater} 0.05), although higher levels in males compared to females almost achieved significance (p = 0.056). At baseline, higher serum BDNF levels were associated with significantly better global cognition scores, relative to individuals with lower serum levels. In addition, following intervention for 18 weeks, high-flavonoid, but not low-flavonoid, fruit and vegetable intake induced significant improvements in cognitive performance and increases in serum BDNF levels (p = {\textless}0.001). Flavanol intervention for 12 weeks also resulted in significant increases in serum BDNF (p = {\textless}0.001), and such increases were correlated with improvements in global cognitive performance. CONCLUSION: Increases in global cognition induced by high flavonoid fruit and vegetables, and cocoa flavanols were paralleled by concurrent changes in serum BDNF levels, suggesting a role for BDNF in flavonoid-induced cognitive improvements. Furthermore, we provide further data suggesting that serum BDNF levels may represent a biomarker of cognitive function.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen overweight subjects were randomly assigned to either a control (C) or a nonivamide (NV) group. Changes in the body composition and plasma concentrations of satiating hormones were determined at fasting and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after a glucose load. Participants were instructed to consume 0.15 mg nonivamide per day in 450 mL of a milk shake additionally to their habitual diet. After treatment, a group difference in body fat mass change (-0.61 ± 0.36\% in NV and +1.36 ± 0.38\% in C) and an increase in postprandial plasma serotonin were demonstrated.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mutations in the p53 oncosuppressor gene are highly frequent in human cancers. These alterations are mainly point mutations in the DNA binding domain of p53 and disable p53 from transactivating target genes devoted to anticancer activity. Mutant p53 proteins are usually more stable than wild-type p53 and may not only impair wild-type p53 activity but also acquire pro-oncogenic functions. Therefore, targeting mutant p53 to clear the hyperstable proteins or change p53 conformation to reactivate wild-type p53 protein functions is a powerful anticancer strategy. Several small molecules have been tested for p53 reactivation in mutant p53-carrying cells while studies exploiting the effect of natural compounds are limited. Capsaicin (CPS) is the major constituent of peppers and show antitumor activity by targeting several molecular pathway, however, its effect on mutant p53 reactivation has not been assessed yet. In this study we aimed at investigating whether mutant p53 could be a new target of capsaicin-induced cell death and the underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: p53 levels were analysed by western blot upon capsaicin treatment in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine. The mutant p53 reactivation was evaluated by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses of wild-type p53 target genes. The specific wild-type p53 activation was determined by using the inhibitor of p53 transactivation function, pifithrin-Î± and siRNA for p53.
RESULTS: Here, we show that capsaicin induced autophagy that was, at least in part, responsible of mutant p53 protein degradation. Abrogation of mutant p53 by capsaicin restored wild-type p53 activities over mutant p53 functions, contributing to cancer cell death. Similar effects were confirmed in cancer cells bearing tumor-associated p53 mutations and in H1299 (p53 null) with overexpressed p53R175H and p53R273H mutant proteins.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate for the first time that capsaicin may reduce mutant p53 levels and reactivate wild-type p53 protein in mutant p53-carrying cells and the p53 reactivation contributes to capsaicin-induced cell death.},

Amino acid deficiency, including L-carnitine, has been proposed to be associated with its pathophysiology. Nevertheless, the efficacy of L-carnitine supplementation on frailty status has not been documented. Thus, this study aimed to determine the effect of 10-week L-carnitine supplement (1.5 g/day) on frailty status and its biomarkers and also physical function, cognition, and nutritional status among prefrail older adults in Klang Valley, Malaysia.
METHODOLOGY: This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted among 50 prefrail subjects randomized into two groups (26 in L-carnitine group and 24 in placebo group). Outcome measures include frailty status using Fried criteria and Frailty Index accumulation of deficit, selected frailty biomarkers (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and insulin-like growth factor-1), physical function, cognitive function, nutritional status and biochemical profile.
RESULTS: The results indicated that the mean scores of Frailty Index score and hand grip test were significantly improved in subjects supplemented with L-carnitine (P{\textless}0.05 for both parameters) as compared to no change in the placebo group. Based on Fried criteria, four subjects (three from the L-carnitine group and one from the control group) transited from prefrail status to robust after the intervention.
CONCLUSION: L-carnitine supplementation has a favorable effect on the functional status and fatigue in prefrail older adults.},

	abstract = {Consumption of olives (Olea europaea L.) is associated with a low incidence of inflammation-related diseases. Olive fruit is rich in bioactive pentacyclic triterpenoids, mainly maslinic acid. This study, a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial, examined the effects of an orally administered maslinic acid supplement, olive fruit extract, on 20 middle-aged and elderly volunteers with mild knee joint pain. Each subject (58 ± 7 years) received either olive fruit extract, containing 50 mg maslinic acid (n = 12), or placebo (n = 8) daily for 12 weeks and evaluated for pain and physical functions as primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures included body composition and inflammatory biomarkers in serum. Although both groups exhibited improved pain visual analogue scale score and quality of life after supplementation, symptoms were better in the maslinic acid group than in the placebo group. After 12 weeks, maslinic acid group exhibited significant decrease in body weight and body mass index suggesting that maslinic acid affected the weight of volunteers with mild knee joint pain. Therefore, olive products containing maslinic acid may be useful as a new preventive and therapeutic food ingredient for arthritic diseases. Since this clinical study is a preliminary study, it was not registered in a publicly accessible database.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depressive episodes and cognitive impairment are major causes of morbidity and dysfunction in individuals suffering from bipolar disorder (BD). Novel treatment approaches that target clinical and cognitive aspects of bipolar depression are needed, and research on pathophysiology suggests that mitochondrial modulators such as the nutraceutical creatine monohydrate might have a therapeutic role for this condition.
METHODS: Eighteen (N=18) patients with bipolar depression according to DSM-IV criteria who were enrollled in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of creatine monohydrate 6g daily as adjunctive therapy were submitted to neuropsychological assessments (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition, Stroop Color-Word Test, Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test, FAS Verbal Fluency Test) at baseline and week 6.
RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the treatment groups of the change on the total scores after 6 weeks in the verbal fluency test, with improvement in the group receiving adjunctive treatment with creatine. We did not find significant differences between the groups of the changes on other neuropsychological tests.
LIMITATIONS: Small sample and lack of a control group of healthy subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our trial, which was the first to investigate the cognitive effects of creatine monohydrate on bipolar depression, indicates that supplementation with this nutraceutical for 6 weeks is associated with improvement in verbal fluency tests in patients with this condition.},

In the ICA group, the serum levels of AP and OCN were higher than in the control group. More Col1-, Col2-, CD31-, and VEGF-positive cells, together with a greater degree of osteogenesis, were detected in the ICA group compared with the control group. During mechanical testing, the ICA group showed a significantly higher ultimate failure load than the control group at both two and four weeks. Our results indicate that the systematic administration of ICA could promote angiogenesis and tendon-bone healing after rotator cuff reconstruction, with superior mechanical strength compared with the controls.

Studies on isolated ovarian theca-interstitial cells suggest that resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, reduces androgen production.
OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate endocrine and metabolic effects of resveratrol on PCOS.
DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a randomized (1:1) double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the effects of resveratrol over a period of 3 months in an academic hospital.
PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Subjects with PCOS were identified according to the Rotterdam criteria. Thirty-four subjects were enrolled and 30 subjects completed the trial. Evaluations were performed at baseline and repeated after 3 months of treatment.
INTERVENTION: Resveratrol (1,500 mg p.o.) or placebo were administered daily.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcome was the change in the serum total T.
RESULTS: Resveratrol treatment led to a significant decrease of total T by 23.1\% (P = .01). In parallel, resveratrol induced a 22.2\% decrease of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P = .01), a decrease of fasting insulin level by 31.8\% (P = .007) and an increase of the Insulin Sensitivity Index (Matsuda and DeFronzo) by 66.3\% (P = .04). Levels of gonadotropins, the lipid profile as well as markers of inflammation and endothelial function were not significantly altered.
CONCLUSIONS: Resveratrol significantly reduced ovarian and adrenal androgens. This effect may be, at least in part, related to an improvement of insulin sensitivity and a decline of insulin level.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of equol and resveratrol supplementation on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in otherwise healthy menopausal women with hot flashes, anxiety and depressive symptoms.
METHODS: Sixty recently menopausal women aged 50-55 years were randomized in a 12-week, placebo-controlled trial to receive 200mg of fermented soy containing 10mg of equol and 25mg of resveratrol (1 tablet/day). The primary outcome was the change in score on the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), used to evaluate the severity of age-/menopause-related complaints. Additional outcome measures included the subject-reported score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), which was used specifically to assess sleep quality.
RESULTS: The symptoms assessed by the MRS improved during treatment in the active group. Comparison between placebo and treatment groups revealed statistically significant improvement in particular for dryness of vagina (-85.7\%) (p{\textless}0.001), heart discomfort (-78.8\%; p{\textless}0.001) and sexual problems (-73.3\%; p{\textless}0.001). On the HAM-D significant improvements at week 12 were seen in work and activities (-94.1\%) (p{\textless}0.001). Subjects treated with equol and resveratrol also had significant differences in the sleep domain of the NHP (p{\textless}0.001).
CONCLUSION: These findings provide evidence that 12 weeks of dietary supplementation with equol and resveratrol may improve menopause-related quality of life in healthy women.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent animal studies have identified that dietary salt intake may modify the risk and progression of autoimmune disorders through modulation of the IL-23/TH17 pathway, which is critical in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of U.S. women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and NHSII who provided detailed and validated information on diet and lifestyle beginning in 1984 in NHS and 1991 in NHSII. We confirmed incident cases of UC and CD reported through 2010 in NHS and 2011 in NHSII. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals. In a case-control study nested within these cohorts, we evaluated the interaction between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in TH17 pathway and dietary potassium on risk of CD and UC. In a cohort of healthy volunteers, we also assessed the effect of supplemental potassium on development of naïve and memory T cells, differentiated with TGFβ1 or TH17 conditions.
RESULTS: Among a total of 194,711 women over a follow-up of 3,220,247 person-years, we documented 273 cases of CD and 335 cases of UC. Dietary intake of potassium (Ptrend = 0.005) but not sodium (Ptrend = 0.44) was inversely associated with risk of CD. Although, both dietary potassium and sodium were not significantly associated with risk of UC, there was a suggestion of an inverse association with dietary potassium (Ptrend = 0.08). The association of potassium with risk of CD and UC appeared to be modified by loci involved in the TH17 pathway that have previously been associated with susceptibility to CD, particularly SNP rs7657746 (IL21) (Pinteraction = 0.004 and 0.01, respectively). In vitro, potassium enhanced the expression of Foxp3 in both naïve and memory CD4+ T cells via activating Smad2/3 and inhibiting Smad7 in TH17 cells.
CONCLUSION: Dietary potassium is inversely associated with risk of CD with both in vitro and gene-environment interaction data suggesting a potential role for potassium in regulating immune tolerance through its effect on Tregs and TH17 pathway.},

Greek virgin olive oils, produced mainly with traditional, non-intensive cultivation practices, are mostly of exceptional quality. The benefits of consuming virgin olive oil, originally attributed to its high oleic acid content, are now considered to be the combined result of several nutrient and non-nutrient phytochemicals. The present work summarizes available data regarding natural antioxidants in Greek virgin olive oils (VOO) namely, polar phenolic compounds, tocopherols, squalene, and triterpenic acids.

Endosperm proteins of ω-gliadin-free genotypes were compared to a control genotype containing all ω-gliadins by A-PAGE, SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC. A considerable decrease (about 30 \%) of gliadin immunoreactivity as a consequence of ω-gliadin elimination was demonstrated by ELISA, using sera of ten patients allergic to gluten. Preliminary evaluation of the technological properties of the ω-gliadin-free genotype by the SDS sedimentation test suggests that elimination of all ω-gliadins may also significantly improve wheat bread making quality.},

	abstract = {As a minor component of vitamin E, tocotrienols were evident in exhibiting biological activities such as neuroprotection, radio-protection, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and lipid lowering properties which are not shared by tocopherols. However, available data on the therapeutic window of tocotrienols remains controversial. It is important to understand the absorption and bioavailability mechanisms before conducting in-depth investigations into the therapeutic efficacy of tocotrienols in humans. In this review, we updated current evidence on the bioavailability of tocotrienols from human studies. Available data from five studies suggested that tocotrienols may reach its target destination through an alternative pathway despite its low affinity for Î±-tocopherol transfer protein. This was evident when studies reported considerable amount of tocotrienols detected in HDL particles and adipose tissues after oral consumption. Besides, plasma concentrations of tocotrienols were shown to be higher when administered with food while self-emulsifying preparation of tocotrienols was shown to enhance the absorption of tocotrienols. Nevertheless, mixed results were observed based on the outcome from 24 clinical studies, focusing on the dosages, study populations and formulations used. This may be due to the variation of compositions and dosages of tocotrienols used, suggesting a need to understand the formulation of tocotrienols in the study design. Essentially, implementation of a control diet such as AHA Step 1 diet may influence the study outcomes, especially in hypercholesterolemic subjects when lipid profile might be modified due to synergistic interaction between tocotrienols and control diet. We also found that the bioavailability of tocotrienols were inconsistent in different target populations, from healthy subjects to smokers and diseased patients. In this review, the effect of dosage, composition and formulation of tocotrienols as well as study populations on the bioavailability of tocotrienols will be discussed.},

METHODS: Healthy subjects (n = 20) were given a prebiotic (2.8 g/day HOST-G904, HOST Therabiomics, Jersey, Channel Islands) for 3 weeks. During 3-day periods immediately before, at the beginning and at the end of the administration subjects were put on a standard diet (low fibre diet supplemented with one portion of high fibre foods) and the following outcomes were measured: (i) number of daytime gas evacuations for 2 days by means of an event marker; (ii) volume of gas evacuated via a rectal tube during 4 h after a test meal; and (iii) microbiota composition by faecal Illumina MiSeq sequencing.
RESULTS: At the beginning of administration, HOST-G904 significantly increased the number of daily anal gas evacuations (18 ± 2 vs. 12 ± 1 pre-administration; P {\textless} 0.001) and the volume of gas evacuated after the test meal (236 ± 23 mL vs. 160 ± 17 mL pre-administration; P = 0.006). However, after 3 weeks of administration, these effects diminished (11 ± 2 daily evacuations, 169 ± 23 mL gas evacuation). At day 21, relative abundance of butyrate producers (Lachnospiraceae) correlated inversely with the volume of gas evacuated (r = -0.52; P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: The availability of substrates induces an adaptation of the colonic microbiota activity in bacterial metabolism, which produces less gas and associated issues. Clinical trials.gov NCT02618239.},

It is the product of the histidine decarboxylase activity, and its effects are mainly mediated through four different G-protein coupled receptors. Thus, histamine-related effects are the results of highly interconnected and tissue-specific signalling networks. Consequently, alterations in histamine-related factors could be an important part in the cause of multiple rare/orphan diseases. Bearing this hypothesis in mind, more than 25 rare diseases related to histamine physiopathology have been identified using a computationally assisted text mining approach. These newly integrated data will provide insight to elucidate the molecular causes of these rare diseases. The data can also help in devising new intervention strategies for personalized medicine for multiple rare diseases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oat and barley beta-glucans are prebiotic fibers known for their cholesterol-lowering activity, but their action on the human gut microbiota metabolism is still under research. Although the induction of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) following their ingestion has previously been reported, no study has investigated their effects on proteolytic uremic toxins p-cresyl sulfate (pCS) and indoxyl sulfate (IS) levels, while others have failed to demonstrate an effect on the endothelial function measured through flow-mediated dilation (FMD).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate whether a nutritional intervention with a functional pasta enriched with beta-glucans could promote a saccharolytic shift on the gut microbial metabolism and improve FMD.
METHODS: We carried out a pilot study on 26 healthy volunteers who underwent a 2-month dietary treatment including a daily administration of Granoro "Cuore Mio" pasta enriched with barley beta-glucans (3g/100g). Blood and urine routine parameters, serum pCS/IS and FMD were evaluated before and after the dietary treatment.
RESULTS: The nutritional treatment significantly reduced LDL and total cholesterol, as expected. Moreover, following beta-glucans supplementation we observed a reduction of serum pCS levels and an increase of FMD, while IS serum levels remained unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that a beta-glucans dietary intervention in healthy volunteers correlates with a saccharolytic shift on the gut microbiota metabolism, as suggested by the decrease of pCS and the increase of SCFA, and associates with an improved endothelial reactivity. Our pilot study suggests, in addition to cholesterol, novel pCS-lowering properties of beta-glucans, worthy to be confirmed in large-scale trials and particularly in contexts where the reduction of the microbial-derived uremic toxin pCS is of critical importance, such as in chronic kidney disease.},

	doi = {10.1249/MSS.0000000000001213},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Carnosine is a dipeptide composed of β-alanine and L-histidine and is present in skeletal muscle. Chronic oral β-alanine supplementation can induce muscle carnosine loading and is therefore seen as the rate-limiting factor for carnosine synthesis. However, the effect of L-histidine supplementation on carnosine levels in humans is never established. This study aims to investigate whether 1) L-histidine supplementation can induce muscle carnosine loading and 2) combined supplementation of both amino acids is more efficient than β-alanine supplementation alone.
METHODS: Fifteen male and 15 female participants were equally divided in three groups. Each group was supplemented with either pure β-alanine (BA) (6 g·d), L-histidine (HIS) (3.5 g·d), or both amino acids (BA + HIS). Before (D0), after 12 d (D12), and after 23 d (D23) of supplementation, carnosine content was evaluated in soleus and gastrocnemius medialis muscles by H-MRS, and venous blood samples were collected. Muscle biopsies were taken at D0 and D23 from the vastus lateralis. Plasma and muscle metabolites (β-alanine, histidine, and carnosine) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.
RESULTS: Both BA and BA + HIS groups showed increased carnosine concentrations in all investigated muscles, with no difference between these groups. By contrast, carnosine levels in the HIS group remained unaltered. Histidine levels were significantly decreased in plasma (-30.6\%) and muscle (-31.6\%) of the BA group, and this was prevented when β-alanine and L-histidine were supplemented simultaneously.
CONCLUSION: We confirm that β-alanine, and not L-histidine, is the rate-limiting precursor for carnosine synthesis in human skeletal muscle. Yet, although L-histidine is not rate limiting, its availability is not unlimited and gradually declines upon chronic β-alanine supplementation. The significance of this decline still needs to be determined, but may affect physiological processes such as protein synthesis.},

Versus the control mice, biotin-supplemented mice had an altered portal triad with dilated sinusoids, increased vascularity, and bile conducts. Furthermore, we observed an increased proportion of nucleomegaly and binucleated hepatocytes. In spite of the liver morphological changes, no differences were observed in the serum liver damage indicators, oxidative stress markers, or antioxidant enzymes.

Ratings of the bitterness of caffeine and quinine and three other bitter stimuli (urea, propylthiouracil, and denatonium benzoate) were compared with relative taste papilla mRNA abundance of bitter receptors that respond to the corresponding bitter stimuli in cell-based assays ( TAS2R4, TAS2R10, TAS2R38, TAS2R43, and TAS2R46). We calculated caffeine and quinine intake from a food frequency questionnaire. The bitterness of caffeine was related to the abundance of the combined mRNA expression of these known receptors, r = 0.47, p = .05, and self-reported daily caffeine intake, t(18) = 2.78, p = .012. The results of linear modeling indicated that 47\% of the variance among subjects in the rating of caffeine bitterness was accounted for by these two factors (habitual caffeine intake and taste receptor mRNA abundance). We observed no such relationships for quinine but consumption of its primary dietary form (tonic water) was uncommon. Overall, diet and TAS2R gene expression in taste papillae are related to individual differences in caffeine perception.},

Twenty-two (9 men and 13 women) triathletes (age, 38 ± 11 years) completed 2 double-blind, crossover, randomized trials (BRC and placebo) starting 7 days apart. Each trial was preceded by 6 days of supplementation with 100 mg·day-1 of BRC or placebo. On the 7th day of supplementation, exercise trials commenced 120 min after ingestion of 50 mg BRC or placebo and consisted of 40 min of cycling (75 ± 5\% maximal oxygen consumption) followed by a 10-km running time trial (TT). Subjects returned 24 h later to complete a 5-km running TT to assess recovery. Ten-kilometer TT duration (49.5 ± 8.9 vs. 50.8 ± 10.3 min, p = 0.03) was faster with the BRC treatment. Despite running faster, average heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion were not different between treatments. Five-kilometer TT duration (23.2 ± 4.4 vs 23.9 ± 4.7 min, p = 0.003), 24 h after the 10-km TT, was faster in 17 of the 22 subjects with the BRC treatment. Creatine kinase, a muscle damage marker, increased less (40.5 ± 22.5 vs. 49.7 ± 21.5 U·L-1, p = 0.02) from baseline to after the 10-km TT and subjective fatigue increased less (-0.05 ± 6.1 vs. 3.23 ± 6.1, p = 0.05) from baseline to 24 h after the 10-km TT with BRC. In conclusion, BRC supplementation improved 10-km TT performance in competitive male and female triathletes. Improved 5-km TT performances 24 h after the 10-km TT and the attenuated increase of creatine kinase and fatigue suggest an increase in recovery while taking BRC.},

Cholesterol is rate-limiting for myelin biogenesis in the developing CNS; however, whether cholesterol insufficiency contributes to remyelination failure in MS, is unclear. Here, we show the relationship between cholesterol, myelination and neurological parameters in mouse models of demyelination and remyelination. In the cuprizone model, acute disease reduces serum cholesterol levels that can be restored by dietary cholesterol. Concomitant with blood-brain barrier impairment, supplemented cholesterol directly supports oligodendrocyte precursor proliferation and differentiation, and restores the balance of growth factors, creating a permissive environment for repair. This leads to attenuated axon damage, enhanced remyelination and improved motor learning. Remarkably, in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, cholesterol supplementation does not exacerbate disease expression. These findings emphasize the safety of dietary cholesterol in inflammatory diseases and point to a previously unrecognized role of cholesterol in promoting repair after demyelinating episodes.},

The action of l-Lysine (4.95 g/day orally) on the adrenal cortex was also evaluated in 20 healthy volunteers in a double blind, cross-over, placebo controlled study. l-Lysine had no significant influence on basal plasma aldosterone levels and the aldosterone responses to upright posture, tetracosactide, and low sodium diet (10 mmol/day for 3 days). Conversely, l-Lysine significantly reduced the surge of plasma aldosterone induced by metoclopramide indicating that l-Lysine is able to efficiently antagonize the adrenal 5-HT4 receptors in vivo. These results suggest that l-Lysine supplementation may represent a new treatment of primary adrenal diseases in which corticosteroid hypersecretion is driven by overexpressed 5-HT4 receptors.},

	abstract = {This study characterizes the human metabolic response to piperine, a curcumin extract, and the details of its underlying molecular mechanism. Using 1H-NMR-based metabolome analysis, we showed the metabolic effect of piperine on skeletal muscle and found that piperine increased the level of intracellular lactate, an important metabolic intermediate that controls expression of several genes involved in mitochondrial activity. Piperine also induced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream target, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), while additionally stimulating glucose uptake in an AMPK dependent manner. Piperine also stimulates the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), an effect that was reversed by pretreatment with compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. Inhibition of p38 MAPK resulted in no piperine-induced glucose uptake. Increased level of lactate resulted in increased expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which regulates energy expenditure, thermogenesis, and fat browning. Knock-down of AMPK blocked piperine-induced UCP1 up-regulation, demonstrating the required role of AMPK in this effect. Taken together, these results suggest that piperine leads to benign metabolic effects by activating the AMPK-p38 MAPK signaling pathway and UCP1 expression by activating intracellular lactate production in skeletal muscle.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coconut oil is commonly used as herbal medicine worldwide. There is limited information regarding its effects on the developing embryo and infant growth.
METHODS: We investigated the effect of virgin coconut oil post-natally and until 6 weeks old in mice (age of maturity). Females were fed with either standard, virgin olive oil or virgin coconut oil diets 1 month prior to copulation, during gestation and continued until weaning of pups. Subsequently, groups of pups borne of the respective diets were continuously fed the same diet as its mother from weaning until 6 weeks old. Profiles of the standard and coconut oil diets were analysed by gas chromatography flame ionization detector (GCFID).
RESULTS: Analysis of the mean of the total weight gained/ loss over 6 weeks revealed that in the first 3 weeks, pups whose mothers were fed virgin coconut oil and virgin olive oil have a significantly lower body weight than that of standard diet pups. At 6 weeks of age, only virgin coconut oil fed pups exhibited significantly lower body weight. We report that virgin coconut oil modifies the fatty acid profiles of the standard diet by inducing high levels of medium chain fatty acids with low levels of essential fatty acids. Furthermore, pups borne by females fed with virgin coconut oil developed spiky fur.
CONCLUSION: Our study has demonstrated that virgin coconut oil could affect infant growth and appearance via maternal intake; we suggest the use of virgin coconut oil as herbal medicine to be treated with caution.},

No study has investigated the effects of prolonged supplementation on carnosine-related genes or exercise capacity.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of 24 wk of BA supplementation on muscle carnosine content, gene expression, and high-intensity cycling capacity (CCT110\%).
METHODS: Twenty-five active males were supplemented with 6.4 g·d of sustained release BA or placebo for a 24 wk period. Every 4 wk participants provided a muscle biopsy and performed the CCT110\%. Biopsies were analyzed for muscle carnosine content and gene expression (CARNS, TauT, ABAT, CNDP2, PHT1, PEPT2, and PAT1).
RESULTS: Carnosine content was increased from baseline at every time point in BA (all P {\textless} 0.0001; week 4 = +11.37 ± 7.03 mmol·kg dm, week 8 = +13.88 ± 7.84 mmol·kg dm, week 12 = +16.95 ± 8.54 mmol·kg dm, week 16 = +17.63 ± 8.42 mmol·kg dm, week 20 = +21.20 ± 7.86 mmol·kg dm, and week 24 = +20.15 ± 7.63 mmol·kg dm) but not placebo (all P {\textgreater} 0.05). Maximal increases were +25.66 ± 7.63 mmol·kg dm (range = +17.13 to +41.32 mmol·kg dm), and absolute maximal content was 48.03 ± 8.97 mmol·kg dm (range = 31.79 to 63.92 mmol·kg dm). There was an effect of supplement (P = 0.002) on TauT; no further differences in gene expression were shown. Exercise capacity was improved in BA (P = 0.05) with possible to almost certain improvements across all weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-four weeks of BA supplementation increased muscle carnosine content and improved high-intensity cycling capacity. The downregulation of TauT suggests it plays an important role in muscle carnosine accumulation with BA supplementation, whereas the variability in changes in muscle carnosine content between individuals suggests that other determinants other than the availability of BA may also bear a major influence on muscle carnosine content.},

Skeletal muscle carnosine content can be increased through β-alanine supplementation, but the maximum increase achievable with supplementation is unknown. No study has investigated the effects of prolonged supplementation on carnosine-related genes or exercise capacity.

Purpose:
To investigate the effects of 24-weeks of β-alanine supplementation on muscle carnosine content, gene expression and high-intensity cycling capacity (CCT110\%).

Methods:
Twenty-five active males were supplemented with 6.4 g·day of sustained release β-alanine (BA) or placebo (PL) over a 24-week period. Every 4 weeks participants provided a muscle biopsy and performed the CCT110\%. Biopsies were analysed for muscle carnosine content and gene expression (CARNS, TauT, ABAT, CNDP2, PHT1, PEPT2 and PAT1).

Results:
Carnosine content was increased from baseline at every time point in BA (all P{\textless}0.0001; Week 4: +11.37±7.03 mmol·kgdm, Week 8: +13.88±7.84 mmol·kgdm, Week 12: +16.95±8.54 mmol·kgdm, Week 16: +17.63±8.42 mmol·kgdm, Week 20: +21.20±7.86 mmol·kgdm, Week 24: +20.15±7.63 mmol·kgdm), but not PL (all P=1.00). Maximal changes were +25.66±7.63 mmol·kgdm (range: +17.13 to +41.32 mmol·kgdm), and absolute maximal content was 48.03±8.97 mmol·kgdm (range: 31.79 to 63.92 mmol·kgdm). There was an effect of supplement (P=0.002) on TauT; no further differences in gene expression were shown. Exercise capacity was improved in BA (P=0.05) with possible to almost certain improvements across all weeks.

Twenty-four weeks of β-alanine supplementation increased muscle carnosine content and improved high-intensity cycling capacity.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intestinal immune activation is involved in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) pathophysiology. While most dietary approaches in IBS involve food avoidance, there are fewer indications on food supplementation. Palmithoylethanolamide, structurally related to the endocannabinoid anandamide, and polydatin are dietary compounds which act synergistically to reduce mast cell activation.
AIM: To assess the effect on mast cell count and the efficacy of palmithoylethanolamide/polydatin in patients with IBS.
METHODS: We conducted a pilot, 12-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study assessing the effect of palmithoylethanolamide/polydatin 200 mg/20 mg or placebo b.d. on low-grade immune activation, endocannabinoid system and symptoms in IBS patients. Biopsy samples, obtained at screening visit and at the end of the study, were analysed by immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunoassay, liquid chromatography and Western blot.
RESULTS: A total of 54 patients with IBS and 12 healthy controls were enrolled from five European centres. Compared with controls, IBS patients showed higher mucosal mast cell counts (3.2 ± 1.3 vs. 5.3 ± 2.7\%, P = 0.013), reduced fatty acid amide oleoylethanolamide (12.7 ± 9.8 vs. 45.8 ± 55.6 pmol/mg, P = 0.002) and increased expression of cannabinoid receptor 2 (0.7 ± 0.1 vs. 1.0 ± 0.8, P = 0.012). The treatment did not significantly modify IBS biological profile, including mast cell count. Compared with placebo, palmithoylethanolamide/polydatin markedly improved abdominal pain severity (P {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The marked effect of the dietary supplement palmithoylethanolamide/polydatin on abdominal pain in patients with IBS suggests that this is a promising natural approach for pain management in this condition. Further studies are now required to elucidate the mechanism of action of palmithoylethanolamide/polydatin in IBS. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01370720.},

	abstract = {We have previously shown that a diet containing epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and beta-alanine is not effective in improving either cognitive or muscle function in aged (18 month) mice (Gibbons et al., Behav. Brain Res., 2014, 272:131-140; Pence et al., Appl. Physiol. Nutr. Metab., 2016, 41(2): 181-190). However, this diet reduced oxidative stress in the brain, and previous studies using longer term interventions and other doses have documented beneficial effects in cognitive and muscle function, especially with EGCG. Here we hypothesized that a different dose of EGCG or longer feeding period would be more efficacious in improving cognition. Aged (21-25 mo) Balb/cByJ male mice underwent 63 days of feeding with EGCG at 0, 0.091, or 3.67 mg/g AIN-93M diet and were then subjected to a battery of cognitive and muscle function tests. EGCG feeding at either of the 2 doses did not alter preference for novel versus familiar arm in the Y-maze test (p = 0.29) and did not affect learning in the active avoidance test (p = 0.76). Similarly, EGCG did not affect preference for novel versus familiar mice in a social discrimination test (p = 0.17). Likewise, there was no effect of EGCG on muscle function by grip strength (p = 0.16), rotarod (p = 0.18), or treadmill test to exhaustion (p = 0.25). EGCG reduced mortality in a dose-dependent fashion (p = 0.05, log-rank test for trend), with 91\% of high EGCG, 72\% of low EGCG, and 55\% of control mice surviving to the end of the study. In conclusion, EGCG improves survival in aged mice but does not affect cognitive or muscle function.},

	abstract = {Low-grade sustained inflammation links obesity to insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, therapeutic approaches to improve systemic energy balance and chronic inflammation in obesity are limited. Pharmacological activation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) alleviates obesity and insulin resistance in mice; however, Nrf2 inducers are not clinically available owing to safety concerns. Thus, we examined whether dietary glucoraphanin, a stable precursor of the Nrf2 inducer sulforaphane, ameliorates systemic energy balance, chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and NAFLD in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Glucoraphanin supplementation attenuated weight gain, decreased hepatic steatosis, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed wild-type mice but not in HFD-fed Nrf2 knockout mice. Compared with vehicle-treated controls, glucoraphanin-treated HFD-fed mice had lower plasma lipopolysaccharide levels and decreased relative abundance of the gram-negative bacteria family Desulfovibrionaceae in their gut microbiomes. In HFD-fed mice, glucoraphanin increased energy expenditure and the protein expression of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) in inguinal and epididymal adipose depots. Additionally, in this group, glucoraphanin attenuated hepatic lipogenic gene expression, lipid peroxidation, classically activated M1-like macrophage accumulation, and inflammatory signaling pathways. By promoting fat browning, limiting metabolic endotoxemia-related chronic inflammation, and modulating redox stress, glucoraphanin may mitigate obesity, insulin resistance, and NAFLD.},

SUBJECTS/METHODS: In an eight-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 83 healthy adults with white blood cell counts of 4,000-8,000 cells/µL were participated and randomly assigned to take two capsules per day containing either 350 mg β-1,3-glucan or placebo. Six participants withdrew their study consent or were excluded due to NK cell activity levels outside the normal range. NK cell activity and serum levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were measured.
RESULTS: NK cell activity and the serum levels of IL-10 were significantly higher from baseline to week 8 in the β-glucan group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.048, P = 0.029). Consumption of β-1,3-glucan also significantly increased NK cell activity compared with placebo after adjusting for smoking and stress status (P = 0.009). In particular, the effect of β-1,3-glucan on NK cell activity was greater in participants with severe stress than in those experiencing mild stress. However, the administration β-1,3-glucan did not significantly modulate the levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α and IgG compared with the placebo.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that supplementation with bacterial β-1,3-glucan significantly increased NK cell activity without causing any adverse effects. Additionally, the beneficial effect of β-1,3-glucan on NK cell activity was greater in participants experiencing severe stress.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Obesity and metabolic diseases are associated with alterations in microbial composition and impaired gut barrier. Previous in vitro and animal studies have shown that arabinoxylans (AX) have the potential to modulate gut microbiota and gut barrier and therefore could have a protective role. Primary aim of the study was to investigate the effect of AX on intestinal permeability. Secondary aims included the effect of AX on gene transcription and protein expression of tight junctions (TJ), intestinal microbiota composition and activity, immune response and metabolic markers in overweight and obese individuals.
METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 47 overweight subjects were randomly assigned to groups receiving 7.5 g/d AX (n = 16), 15 g/d AX (n = 17) or 15 g/d placebo (n = 14) for 6 wks. Intestinal permeability was investigated using a multi-sugar test. Sigmoid colon tissue was obtained from a subgroup (n = 26) for analyzing gene transcription and mucosal expression of TJ proteins. Fecal samples were collected to assess microbial composition and activity. Furthermore, the production of cytokines by stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was examined. Blood was also sampled for measuring metabolic markers.
RESULTS: No significant changes in gastrointestinal permeability and TJ protein expression were observed after 6 wks AX supplementation compared to placebo. However, gene transcription of occludin was upregulated in the 7.5 g AX group, and transcription of claudin-3 and claudin-4 were upregulated in the 15 g AX group compared to placebo. Furthermore, fecal microbiota diversity was decreased after 6 wks 15 g AX treatment, but no change in relative abundance of dominant phyla was observed. AX intake significantly decreased fecal pH and increased fecal concentrations of total SCFAs, acetate, propionate and butyrate, compared to placebo. Additionally, a decreased TNFα production by stimulated PBMCs was observed after 15 g AX treatment. No changes in metabolic markers were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Regular consumption of AX resulted in a more beneficial fermentation profile in overweight and obese individuals. Further studies are required to assess whether such fermentation profile will translate into improved gut barrier function and immune health.

	abstract = {Background Alterations in the composition of gut microbiota - known as dysbiosis - has been proposed to contribute to the development of obesity, thereby supporting the potential interest of nutrients targeting the gut with beneficial effect for host adiposity. We test the ability of a specific concentrate of water-extractable high molecular weight arabinoxylans (AX) from wheat to modulate both the gut microbiota and lipid metabolism in high-fat (HF) diet-induced obese mice. Methodology/Principal Findings Mice were fed either a control diet (CT) or a HF diet, or a HF diet supplemented with AX (10\% w/w) during 4 weeks. AX supplementation restored the number of bacteria that were decreased upon HF feeding, i.e. Bacteroides-Prevotella spp. and Roseburia spp. Importantly, AX treatment markedly increased caecal bifidobacteria content, in particular Bifidobacterium animalis lactis. This effect was accompanied by improvement of gut barrier function and by a lower circulating inflammatory marker. Interestingly, rumenic acid (C18:2 c9,t11) was increased in white adipose tissue due to AX treatment, suggesting the influence of gut bacterial metabolism on host tissue. In parallel, AX treatment decreased adipocyte size and HF diet-induced expression of genes mediating differentiation, fatty acid uptake, fatty acid oxidation and inflammation, and decreased a key lipogenic enzyme activity in the subcutaneous adipose tissue. Furthermore, AX treatment significantly decreased HF-induced adiposity, body weight gain, serum and hepatic cholesterol accumulation and insulin resistance. Correlation analysis reveals that Roseburia spp. and Bacteroides/Prevotella levels inversely correlate with these host metabolic parameters. Conclusions/Significance Supplementation of a concentrate of water-extractable high molecular weight AX in the diet counteracted HF-induced gut dysbiosis together with an improvement of obesity and lipid-lowering effects. We postulate that hypocholesterolemic, anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity effects are related to changes in gut microbiota. These data support a role for wheat AX as interesting nutrients with prebiotic properties related to obesity prevention.},

Mice were fed either a control diet or a high fat (HF) diet, or a HF diet supplemented with AXOS during 8 weeks.Results:AXOS supplementation induced caecal and colon enlargement associated with an important bifidogenic effect. It increased the level of circulating satietogenic peptides produced by the colon (peptide YY and glucagon-like peptide-1), and coherently counteracted HF-induced body weight gain and fat mass development. HF-induced hyperinsulinemia and the Homeostasis Model Assessment of insulin resistance were decreased upon AXOS feeding. In addition, AXOS reduced HF-induced metabolic endotoxemia, macrophage infiltration (mRNA of F4/80) in the adipose tissue and interleukin 6 (IL6) in the plasma. The tight junction proteins (zonula occludens 1 and claudin 3) altered upon HF feeding were upregulated by AXOS treatment suggesting that the lower inflammatory tone was associated with the improvement of gut barrier function.Conclusion:Together, these findings suggest that specific non-digestible carbohydrates produced from cereals such as AXOS constitute a promising prebiotic nutrient in the control of obesity and related metabolic disorders.},

Differences in xylanase activities and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles, in particular a DNA-band corresponding with Bifidobacterium longum, were found in the proximal colon vessel. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis demonstrated the presence of two different B. longum species in these bacterial communities, showing 99\% gene sequence similarity with B. longum NCC2705 and B. longum. subsp. longum KACC 91563, respectively, further referred to as B. longum D1 and B. longum D2. When grown on LC-AX as the sole added energy source, B. longum D2 displayed significantly higher activities of β-xylanase (5.3-fold), β-xylosidase (2.9-fold), and α-arabinofuranosidase (1.5-fold), respectively, compared to B. longum D1. When B. longum D2 was inoculated in the M-SHIME, inoculated with the bacterial gut communities of the individual with low AX-degrading enzyme activities, the β-xylanase activity increased (1.5-fold) in the proximal vessel. We demonstrated the presence of differences in LC-AX degrading enzyme activities of the bacterial gut communities of two individuals in the in vitro M-SHIME model, which could be linked to the presence of a potent AX-degrading B. longum (D2) strain.},

Subjects completed a 7-day food diary. At 0 and 5 weeks, venous blood was collected for determination of fasting and 2 h glucose, insulin, fructosamine and blood lipids. Blood pressure, body weight and body fat were also determined. A 24 h faecal sample, from 12 subjects, was weighed and analysed for faecal polysaccharide as a marker for dietary compliance.Results: Control and AX diets were similar except the AX diet supplied an additional 15.1 (12.0–18.5) (mean (95\% confidence intervals)) g/day dietary fibre (P=0.000). Consumption of the AX diet increased faecal output by 61.5 (0.2–122.8) g/day (P=0.05) on a wet weight basis and significantly lowered fasting and 2 h plasma glucose, 2 h insulin and serum fructosamine (P=0.002, 0.000, 0.015, and 0.02, respectively).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the interaction of gliadin with intestinal epithelial cells and the mechanism(s) through which gliadin crosses the intestinal epithelial barrier. We investigated whether gliadin has any immediate effect on zonulin release and signaling.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Both ex vivo human small intestines and intestinal cell monolayers were exposed to gliadin, and zonulin release and changes in paracellular permeability were monitored in the presence and absence of zonulin antagonism. Zonulin binding, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) redistribution were evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Tight junction occludin and ZO-1 gene expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: When exposed to gliadin, zonulin receptor-positive IEC6 and Caco2 cells released zonulin in the cell medium with subsequent zonulin binding to the cell surface, rearrangement of the cell cytoskeleton, loss of occludin-ZO1 protein-protein interaction, and increased monolayer permeability. Pretreatment with the zonulin antagonist FZI/0 blocked these changes without affecting zonulin release. When exposed to luminal gliadin, intestinal biopsies from celiac patients in remission expressed a sustained luminal zonulin release and increase in intestinal permeability that was blocked by FZI/0 pretreatment. Conversely, biopsies from non-celiac patients demonstrated a limited, transient zonulin release which was paralleled by an increase in intestinal permeability that never reached the level of permeability seen in celiac disease (CD) tissues. Chronic gliadin exposure caused down-regulation of both ZO-1 and occludin gene expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we concluded that gliadin activates zonulin signaling irrespective of the genetic expression of autoimmunity, leading to increased intestinal permeability to macromolecules.},

	abstract = {The anatomical and functional arrangement of the gastrointestinal tract suggests that this organ, beside its digestive and absorptive functions, regulates the trafficking of macromolecules between the environment and the host through a barrier mechanism. Under physiological circumstances, this trafficking is safeguarded by the competency of intercellular tight junctions, structures whose physiological modulation is mediated by, among others, the recently described protein zonulin. To prevent harm and minimize inflammation, the same paracellular pathway, in concert with the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and the neuroendocrine network, controls the equilibrium between tolerance and immunity to nonself antigens. The zonulin pathway has been exploited to deliver drugs, macromolecules, or vaccines that normally would not be absorbed through the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier. However, if the tightly regulated trafficking of macromolecules is jeopardized secondary to prolonged zonulin up-regulation, the excessive flow of nonself antigens in the intestinal submucosa can cause both intestinal and extraintestinal autoimmune disorders in genetically susceptible individuals. This new paradigm subverts traditional theories underlying the development of autoimmunity, which are based on molecular mimicry and/or the bystander effect, and suggests that the autoimmune process can be arrested if the interplay between genes and environmental triggers is prevented by re-establishing intestinal barrier competency. Understanding the role of zonulin-dependent intestinal barrier dysfunction in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases is an area of translational research that encompasses many fields.},

Here, we analyzed the plasma concentration of collagen-derived peptides after ingestion of high tripeptide containing collagen hydrolysate in humans. We identified 17 types of collagen-derived peptides transiently, with a particular enrichment in Gly-Pro-Hyp. This was also observed using an in vivo mouse model in the plasma and skin, albeit with a higher enrichment of Pro-Hyp in the skin. Interestingly, this Pro-Hyp enrichment in the skin was derived from Gly-Pro-Hyp hydrolysis, as the administration of pure Gly-Pro-Hyp peptide led to similar results.

Reducing senescent cell burden by genetic approaches or by administering senolytics delays or alleviates multiple age- and disease-related adverse phenotypes in preclinical models. Reported senolytics include dasatinib, quercetin, navitoclax (ABT263), and piperlongumine.

Fisetin selectively induces apoptosis in senescent but not proliferating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). It is not senolytic in senescent IMR90 cells, a human lung fibroblast strain, or primary human preadipocytes. A1331852 and A1155463 are senolytic in HUVECs and IMR90 cells, but not preadipocytes.

Epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG) is known to benefit the insulin secretory machinery. We aimed to investigate the effect of daily dietary EGCG supplementation on both the maternal and neonatal treatment outcomes in GDM-affected pregnancies.
METHODS: In total, 472 pregnant women during their third trimester of pregnancy were diagnosed with GDM and subsequently enrolled into this trial. After exclusion, 404 patients were randomly assigned into EGCG and placebo study groups and subsequently administered either 500 mg of EGCG or placebo, respectively, on a daily basis until full term. The daily nutritional intake of all patients was monitored throughout the study. Maternal diabetic parameters at baseline and full term, including metabolism of glucose and insulin, as well as neonatal symptoms at birth, including birth weight, macrosomia, hypoglycaemia, respiratory distress and Apgar scores, were analysed.
RESULTS: In total, 176 and 150 patients from the EGCG and placebo study groups, respectively, completed the trial. Patients from the EGCG group displayed significantly improved maternal diabetic parameters, and fewer cases of neonatal complications, compared to the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS: Daily dietary EGCG supplement improves both maternal and neonatal treatment outcomes of GDM.},

	abstract = {Background: The thermogenic effects of green tea catechin have been repeatedly reported, but their mechanisms are poorly understood.Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the acute and chronic effects of catechin on brown adipose tissue (BAT), a site specialized for nonshivering thermogenesis, in humans.Design: Fifteen healthy male volunteers underwent fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography to assess BAT activity. To examine the acute catechin effect, whole-body energy expenditure (EE) after a single oral ingestion of a beverage containing 615 mg catechin and 77 mg caffeine (catechin beverage) was measured. Next, to investigate the chronic catechin effects, 10 men with low BAT activity were enrolled. Before and after ingestion of the catechin beverage 2 times/d for 5 wk, cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT) after 2 h of cold exposure at 19°C, which is proportional to BAT activity, was examined. Both the acute and chronic trials were single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, season-matched crossover studies.Results: A single ingestion of the catechin beverage increased EE in 9 subjects who had metabolically active BAT (mean ± SEM: +15.24 ± 1.48 kcal, P {\textless} 0.01) but not in 6 subjects who had negligible activities (mean ± SEM: +3.42 ± 2.68 kcal). The ingestion of a placebo beverage containing 82 mg caffeine produced a smaller and comparative EE response in the 2 subject groups. Multivariate regression analysis revealed a significant interaction between BAT and catechin on EE (β = 0.496, P = 0.003). Daily ingestion of the catechin beverage elevated mean ± SEM CIT (from 92.0 ± 26.5 to 197.9 ± 27.7 kcal/d; P = 0.009), whereas the placebo beverage did not change it.Conclusion: Orally ingested tea catechin with caffeine acutely increases EE associated with increased BAT activity and chronically elevates nonshivering CIT, probably because of the recruitment of BAT, in humans.

Therefore, we performed a non-targeted comprehensive metabolomic analysis on blood, urine, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle tissue in middle-aged men with metabolic syndrome randomized to either resveratrol or placebo treatment for four months. Changes in steroid hormones across all four matrices were the most pronounced changes observed. Resveratrol treatment reduced sulfated androgen precursors in blood, adipose tissue, and muscle tissue, and increased these metabolites in urine. Furthermore, markers of muscle turnover were increased and lipid metabolism was affected, with increased intracellular glycerol and accumulation of long-chain saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated (n3 and n6) free fatty acids in resveratrol-treated men. Finally, urinary derivatives of aromatic amino acids, which mainly reflect the composition of the gut microbiota, were altered upon resveratrol treatment. In conclusion, the non-targeted metabolomics approach applied to four different matrices provided evidence of subtle but robust effects on several metabolic pathways following resveratrol treatment for four months in men with metabolic syndrome-effects that, for the most part, would not have been detected by routine analyses. The affected pathways should be the focus of future clinical trials on resveratrol's effects, and perhaps particularly the areas of steroid metabolism and the gut microbiome.},

The metabolic rate of skeletal muscle can be increased by shifting myosin heads from the super-relaxed state (SRX), with a low ATPase activity, to a disordered relaxed state (DRX), with a higher ATPase activity. The shift of myosin heads was detected by a change in fluorescent intensity of a probe attached to the myosin regulatory light chain in skinned skeletal fibers, allowing us to perform a high-throughput screen of 2,128 compounds. The screen identified one compound, which destabilized the super-relaxed state, piperine (the main alkaloid component of black pepper). Destabilization of the SRX by piperine was confirmed by single-nucleotide turnover measurements. The effect was only observed in fast twitch skeletal fibers and not in slow twitch fibers or cardiac tissues. Piperine increased ATPase activity of skinned relaxed fibers by 66 ± 15\%. The Kd was ∼2 µM. Piperine had little effect on the mechanics of either fully active or resting muscle fibers. Previous work has shown that piperine can mitigate both obesity and type 2 diabetes in rodent models of these conditions. We propose that the increase in resting muscle metabolism contributes to these positive effects. The results described here show that up-regulation of resting muscle metabolism could treat obesity and type 2 diabetes and that piperine would provide a useful lead compound for the development of these therapies.},

	abstract = {Schisandrae fructus (SF) has recently been reported to increase skeletal muscle mass and inhibit atrophy in mice. We investigated the effect of SF extract on human myotube differentiation and its acting pathway. Various concentrations (0.1-10 μg/mL) of SF extract were applied on human skeletal muscle cells in vitro. Myotube area and fusion index were measured to quantify myotube differentiation. The maximum effect was observed at 0.5 μg/mL of SF extract, enhancing differentiation up to 1.4-fold in fusion index and 1.6-fold in myotube area at 8 days after induction of differentiation compared to control. Phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 and 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase, which initiate translation as downstream of mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, was upregulated in early phases of differentiation after SF treatment. SF also attenuated dexamethasone-induced atrophy. In conclusion, we show that SF augments myogenic differentiation and attenuates atrophy by increasing protein synthesis through mammalian target of rapamycin/70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 signaling pathway in human myotubes. SF can be a useful natural dietary supplement in increasing skeletal muscle mass, especially in the aged with sarcopenia and the patients with disuse atrophy.},

	abstract = {Erythrocyte deformability is an important property of erythrocytes that considerably affects blood flow and hemodynamics. The high content of polyphenols present in dark chocolate has been reported to play a protective role in functionality of erythrocytes. We hypothesized that chocolate might influence erythrocytes not only after repeated chronic intake, but also immediately after its ingestion. Thus, we determined the acute effect of dark chocolate and milk (with lower content of biologically active substances) chocolate intake on erythrocyte deformability. We also focused on selected factors that may affect erythrocyte deformability, specifically nitric oxide production in erythrocytes and total antioxidant capacity of plasma. We determined posttreatment changes in the mentioned parameters 2hours after consumption of chocolate compared with their levels before consumption of chocolate. In contrast to milk chocolate intake, the dark chocolate led to a significantly higher increase in erythrocyte deformability. Nitric oxide production in erythrocytes was not changed after dark chocolate intake, but significantly decreased after milk chocolate. The plasma total antioxidant capacity remained unaffected after ingestion of both chocolates. We conclude that our hypothesis was confirmed. Single ingestion of dark chocolate improved erythrocyte deformability despite unchanged nitric oxide production and antioxidant capacity of plasma. Increased deformability of erythrocytes may considerably improve rheological properties of blood and thus hemodynamics in humans, resulting in better tissue oxygenation.},

	abstract = {Background: Resveratrol, a plant-derived polyphenol, has been reported to improve glucose metabolism and vascular function and to extend life span in animal models, but studies in humans have been inconclusive.
Methods: In a randomized, double-blind crossover study, we treated older glucose-intolerant adults (n = 30) with resveratrol (2-3 g/daily) or placebo, each for 6 weeks. A standard mixed-meal test was used to assess insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) and secretion (C-peptide deconvolution) and vascular function by reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry. Skeletal muscle samples were obtained for gene expression using RNA-Seq analysis and to assess mitochondrial morphology.
Results: There were no changes in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, weight, blood pressure, or lipid profile following resveratrol treatment. Fasting reactive hyperemia index improved with resveratrol (2.02 ± 0.2 vs 1.76 ± 0.02, p = .002). RNA-Seq analysis yielded 140 differentially expressed transcripts (corrected p-value ≤ .05), predominantly associated with mitochondrial genes and noncoding RNA. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis confirmed that mitochondrial dysfunction (p = 2.77 × 10-12) and oxidative phosphorylation (p = 1.41 × 10-11) were the most significantly perturbed pathways. Mitochondrial number, but not size, was increased.
Conclusions: Resveratrol treatment of older adults with impaired glucose regulation may have beneficial effects on vascular function, but not glucose metabolism or insulin sensitivity. Changes in gene expression suggest effects similar to those observed with caloric restriction, which has been shown to increase life and health span in animal models, although its significance for humans is uncertain. Future human studies should address the appropriate dose range and low bioavailability of resveratrol.},

Patients with a bladder tumor were randomized to receive Polyphenon E containing either 800 or 1,200 mg of EGCG or placebo for 14 to 28 days prior to transurethral resection of bladder tumor or cystectomy. The primary objective was to compare the postintervention EGCG tissue levels in patients receiving Polyphenon E as compared with placebo. Secondary objectives included assessments of tissue expression of PCNA, MMP2, clusterin, VEGF, p27, IGF-1, IGFBP-3; correlation of tissue, plasma, and urine levels of EGCG; and EGCG metabolism by catechol-O-methyltransferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase pharmacogenomic mutations. Thirty-one patients (male:female, 26:5; mean age, 67.2 years) were randomized and 29 (94\%) completed the study. There was not an observed significant difference (P = 0.12) in EGCG tissue levels between two Polyphenon E dosage groups combined versus placebo. However, a dose-response relationship for EGCG levels was observed in both normal (P = 0.046) and malignant bladder tissue (P = 0.005) across the three study arms. In addition, EGCG levels in plasma (P {\textless} 0.001) and urine (P {\textless} 0.001) increased and PCNA (P = 0.016) and clusterin (P = 0.008) were downregulated in a dose-dependent fashion. No pharmacogenomic relationship was observed. EGCG levels in plasma, urine, and bladder tissue followed a dose-response relationship, as did modulation of tissue biomarkers of proliferation and apoptosis.

Pre-treatment with glycine significantly attenuated murine cardiac hypertrophy induced by transverse aortic constriction or by administration of angiotensin II (Ang II). This action was associated with a suppressive extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation in myocardium. The cardioprotective effect of glycine disappeared when endogenous glycine receptor α2 was knocked down by mRNA interference in rats. Co-culture experiments revealed that glycine could also antagonize Ang II stimulated release of transforming growth factor β and endothelin-1 by cardiomyocytes, which prevented an over-production of collagens in rat fibroblasts. These results, for the first time, demonstrate that glycine may be a novel cardioprotector against pressure overload induced cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, glycine would be useful in the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.},

The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of vitamin D supplementation and aerobic training on metabolic syndrome and PPARγ expression.
METHODS: Forty female ovariectomized rats were divided into five groups of aerobic training with high (OVX + Exe + HD), moderate (OVX + Exe + MD), and low dose of vitamin D (OVX + Exe + LD), aerobic training receving vehicle (sesame oil; OVX + Exe + oil), and sham-operated control (sham) groups. After 2 mo of treatment, serum insulin, vitamin D, glucose, lipid profile, visceral fat, and liver PPARγ gene expression were measured.
RESULTS: The combination of exercise and high doses of vitamin D significantly reduced insulin (P = 0.039), blood glucose (P = 0.024), and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (P = 0.011), and elevated PPARγ gene expression (P = 0.032). Also, treatment with aerobic training and either high or moderate vitamin D, ameliorated overall metabolic syndrome Z scores (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Findings from the present study suggested that a sedentary lifestyle and vitamin D deficiency accelerated the occurrence of metabolic syndrome probably by decreasing the expression of nuclear receptor PPARγ.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In fresh muscle, supplementation with the rate-limiting precursor of carnosine, β-alanine (BA), results in a decline in muscle half-relaxation time (HRT) potentially via alterations to calcium (Ca2+) handling. Accumulation of hydrogen cation (H+) has been shown to impact Ca2+ signalling during muscular contraction, carnosine has the potential to serve as a cytoplasmic regulator of Ca2+ and H+ coupling, since it binds to both ions. The present study examined the effect of BA supplementation on intrinsic in-vivo isometric knee extensor force production and muscle contractility in both fresh and fatigued human skeletal muscle assessed during voluntary and electrically evoked (nerve and superficial muscle stimulation) contractions.
METHODS: Twenty-three males completed two experimental sessions, pre- and post- 28 day supplementation with 6.4 g.day-1 of BA (n = 12) or placebo (PLA; n = 11). Isometric force was recorded during a series of voluntary and electrically evoked knee extensor contractions.
RESULTS: BA supplementation had no effect on voluntary or electrically evoked isometric force production, or twitch electromechanical delay and time-to-peak tension. There was a significant decline in muscle HRT in fresh and fatigued muscle conditions during both resting (3 ± 13\%; 19 ± 26\%) and potentiated (1 ± 15\%; 2 ± 20\%) twitch contractions.
CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism for reduced HRT in fresh and fatigued skeletal muscle following BA supplementation is unclear. Due to the importance of muscle relaxation on total energy consumption, especially during short, repeated contractions, BA supplementation may prove to be beneficial in minimising contractile slowing induced by fatigue.

In vitro, it has been shown that curcumin can decrease hepcidin synthesis by decreasing STAT3 activity. We conducted a proof-of-concept study to assess the effect of curcuma on hepcidin synthesis in human. This was a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, two-period study performed in 18 healthy male volunteers. Subjects received a single oral dose of 6 g curcuma containing 2\% of curcumin or placebo. Serum hepcidin and iron parameters were assessed repeatedly until 48 h after dosing. When compared with a placebo curcuma decreased hepcidin levels significantly at 6 h (-19\%, P = 0.004), 8 h (-17\%, P = 0.009), and 12 h (-17\%, P = 0.007) and tended to decrease hepcidin at 24 h (-15\%, P = 0.076). Curcuma also significantly increased serum ferritin levels at 6 and 8 h (+7\% for both times, P = 0.018, 0.030, respectively) and had no effects on serum iron, transferrin, and transferrin saturation. This pilot study showed that curcuma decreases serum hepcidin levels in human and supports the idea that curcuma could be useful in treating hepcidin overproduction during inflammatory processes.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pain is a common complaint among postmenopausal women. It has been postulated that vascular dysfunction caused by estrogen decline at menopause plays a key role in the initiation and progression of degradative joint disease, namely age-related osteoarthritis. We evaluated whether supplementation with resveratrol, a phytoestrogen, could improve aspects of well-being such as chronic pain that is commonly experienced by postmenopausal women.
METHODS: A 14-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention with trans-resveratrol (75â€Šmg, twice daily) was conducted in 80 healthy postmenopausal women. Aspects of well-being, including pain, menopausal symptoms, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, mood states, and quality of life were assessed by Short form-36 at baseline and at the end of treatment. Rating scales were averaged to provide a composite score representing overall well-being. Cerebral vasodilator responsiveness to hypercapnia was also assessed as a surrogate marker for cerebrovascular function.
RESULTS: Compared with placebo treatment, there was a significant reduction in pain and an improvement in total well-being after resveratrol supplementation. Both benefits, including measures of quality of life, correlated with improvements in cerebrovascular function.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings indicate potential for resveratrol treatment to reduce chronic pain in age-related osteoarthritis. Resveratrol consumption may also boost perceptions of well-being in postmenopausal women. Further investigation to elucidate underlying mechanisms is warranted.},

Capsules contained either 100 mg of riboflavin or 95 mg of maltodextrin and 5 mg of 10\% ß-carotene. Subjects provided muscle pain and soreness ratings before, during, and immediately after the race and for the 10 subsequent days. Subjects also completed 400-m runs at maximum speed on days 3, 5, and 10 after the race.
RESULTS: For the 32 (18 in the riboflavin group, 14 in the placebo group) race finishers completing the study, muscle pain and soreness ratings during and immediately after the race were found to be significantly lower (p = .043) for the riboflavin group. Analysis of the 400-m run times also showed significantly faster (p {\textless} .05) times for the riboflavin group than the placebo group at post-race days 3 and 5. Both groups showed that muscle pain and soreness had returned to pre-race levels by 5 days after the race and that 400-m run times had returned to pre-race performance levels by 10 days after the race.
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary work suggests that riboflavin supplementation before and during prolonged running might reduce muscle pain and soreness during and at the completion of the exercise and may enhance early functional recovery after the exercise.},

	abstract = {Aging is a major international concern that brings formidable socioeconomic and healthcare challenges. Small molecules capable of improving the health of older individuals are being explored. Small molecules that enhance cellular stress resistance are a promising avenue to alleviate declines seen in human aging. Tomatidine, a natural compound abundant in unripe tomatoes, inhibits age-related skeletal muscle atrophy in mice. Here we show that tomatidine extends lifespan and healthspan in C. elegans, an animal model of aging which shares many major longevity pathways with mammals. Tomatidine improves many C. elegans behaviors related to healthspan and muscle health, including increased pharyngeal pumping, swimming movement, and reduced percentage of severely damaged muscle cells. Microarray, imaging, and behavioral analyses reveal that tomatidine maintains mitochondrial homeostasis by modulating mitochondrial biogenesis and PINK-1/DCT-1-dependent mitophagy. Mechanistically, tomatidine induces mitochondrial hormesis by mildly inducing ROS production, which in turn activates the SKN-1/Nrf2 pathway and possibly other cellular antioxidant response pathways, followed by increased mitophagy. This mechanism occurs in C. elegans, primary rat neurons, and human cells. Our data suggest that tomatidine may delay some physiological aspects of aging, and points to new approaches for pharmacological interventions for diseases of aging.},

Deficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the major circulating form of vitamin D, is associated with an increased risk of age-related chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cognitive impairment, and cancer. In this study, we utilized Caenorhabditis elegans to examine the mechanism by which vitamin D influences aging. We found that vitamin-D3-induced lifespan extension requires the stress response pathway genes skn-1, ire-1, and xbp-1. Vitamin D3 (D3) induced expression of SKN-1 target genes but not canonical targets of XBP-1. D3 suppressed an important molecular pathology of aging, that of widespread protein insolubility, and prevented toxicity caused by human β-amyloid. Our observation that D3 improves protein homeostasis and slows aging highlights the importance of maintaining appropriate vitamin D serum levels and may explain why such a wide variety of human age-related diseases are associated with vitamin D deficiency.},

Greenselect Phytosome (GSP) is a lecithin formulation of a caffeine-free green tea catechin extract. The purpose of the study was to determine the tissue distribution of epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) and its effect on cell proliferation and circulating biomarkers in breast cancer patients. Twelve early breast cancer patients received GSP 300 mg, equivalent to 44.9 mg of EGCG, daily for 4 weeks prior to surgery. The EGCG levels were measured before (free) and after (total) enzymatic hydrolysis by HPLC-MS/MS in plasma, urine, breast cancer tissue, and surrounding normal breast tissue. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline, before the last administration, and 2 hours later. Repeated administration of GSP achieved levels of total EGCG ranging from 17 to 121 ng/mL in plasma. Despite a high between-subject variability, total EGCG was detectable in all tumor tissue samples collected up to 8 ng/g. Median total EGCG concentration was higher in the tumor as compared with the adjacent normal tissue (3.18 ng/g vs. 0 ng/g, P = 0.02). Free EGCG concentrations ranged from 8 to 65.8 ng/mL in plasma (P between last administration and 2 hours after {\textless}0.001). Free EGCG plasma levels showed a significant positive correlation with the Ki-67 decrease in tumor tissue (P = 0.02). No change in any other biomarkers was noted, except for a slight increase in testosterone levels after treatment. Oral GSP increases bioavailability of EGCG, which is detectable in breast tumor tissue and is associated with antiproliferative effects on breast cancer tissue. Cancer Prev Res; 10(6); 363-9.

Here we report for the first time on the simultaneous quantitation of nicotinamide riboside, nicotinamide mononucleotide and NAD in milk by means of a fluorometric, enzyme-coupled assay. Application of this assay to milk from different species revealed that the three vitamers were present in human and donkey milk, while being selectively distributed in the other milks. Human milk was the richest source of nicotinamide mononucleotide. Overall, the three vitamers accounted for a significant fraction of total vitamin B3 content. Pasteurization did not affect the bovine milk content of nicotinamide riboside, whereas UHT processing fully destroyed the vitamin.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oral magnesium supplementation is commonly used to support a low magnesium diet. This investigation set out to determine whether magnesium in a cream could be absorbed transdermally in humans to improve magnesium status.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this single blind, parallel designed pilot study, n = 25 participants (aged 34.3+/-14.8y, height 171.5+/-11cm, weight 75.9 +/-14 Kg) were randomly assigned to either a 56mg/day magnesium cream or placebo cream group for two weeks. Magnesium serum and 24hour urinary excretion were measured at baseline and at 14 days intervention. Food diaries were recorded for 8 days during this period. Mg test and placebo groups' serum and urinary Mg did not differ at baseline. After the Mg2+ cream intervention there was a clinically relevant increase in serum magnesium (0.82 to 0.89 mmol/l,p = 0.29) that was not seen in the placebo group (0.77 to 0.79 mmol/L), but was only statistically significant (p = 0.02)) in a subgroup of non-athletes. Magnesium urinary excretion increased from baseline slightly in the Mg2+ group but with no statistical significance (p = 0.48). The Mg2+ group showed an 8.54\% increase in serum Mg2+ and a 9.1\% increase in urinary Mg2+ while these figures for the placebo group were smaller, i.e. +2.6\% for serum Mg2+ and -32\% for urinary Mg2+. In the placebo group, both serum and urine concentrations showed no statistically significant change after the application of the placebo cream.
CONCLUSION: No previous studies have looked at transdermal absorbency of Mg2+ in human subjects. In this pilot study, transdermal delivery of 56 mg Mg/day (a low dose compared with commercial transdermal Mg2+ products available) showed a larger percentage rise in both serum and urinary markers from pre to post intervention compared with subjects using the placebo cream, but statistical significance was achieved only for serum Mg2+ in a subgroup of non-athletes. Future studies should look at higher dosage of magnesium cream for longer durations.

	abstract = {Acute dilation brought about by the dietary flavonoid quercetin in coronary arterioles has been described earlier, but no information is available on its chronic effects. Male Wistar rats (body weight about 190 g) were divided to two groups: the quercetin-treated group (n=22) had quercetin supplementation of approximately 30 mg/kg/day, whereas the control group (n=20) had none. After eight weeks of treatment, intramural coronary arterioles with identical passive diameters (178+/-14 microm and 171+/-9 microm) were prepared and their biomechanics and pharmacological reactivities were tested using pressure arteriography ex vivo. The spontaneous tone of quercetin-treated arteries was higher (16.5+/-1.9 \% vs. 12.9+/-0.9 \%), which resulted in a reduced lumen size (144+/-9 microm vs. 167+/-12 microm), thicker vascular wall (22.6+/-1.8 microm vs. 17.4+/-1.6 microm) and decreased tangential wall stress (16.8+/-1.1 kPa vs. 20.5+/-1.6 kPa) in supplemented animals (in spontaneous tone at 50 mm Hg, p{\textless}0.01 in all these comparisons). Elevated basal NO release resulted in increased endothelial dilation in quercetin-treated animals, especially at higher intraluminal pressures (10.8+/-2.5 \% vs. 5.7+/-1.3 \% at 70 mm Hg, p{\textless}0.01). We found remodeling of the geometry of coronary arterioles to ensure higher dilatory reserve and nitrogen monoxide production, as well as lowered elastic stress of the vessel wall.},

The active agent in the selenized yeast supplement was assumed to be selenomethionine (SEMET), although the supplement had not been well speciated. The SELECT study, largely motivated by the NPC trial, enrolling nearly 40 times as many subjects, showed unequivocally that selenium 200 mcg/day, with selenium in the form of SEMET, does not protect selenium-replete men against prostate or other major cancer. The agent tested by SELECT, pure SEMET, could have been different from the selenized yeast tested in NPC. One of the selenium forms suspected of having chemopreventive effects, and which may have been present in the NPC agent, is methyl selenocysteine (MSC). This study, with 29 selenium-replete patients enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial, compared the multiple-dose toxicity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MSC and SEMET. Patients were on trial for 84 days. No toxicity was observed. Although SEMET supplementation increased blood selenium concentration more than MSC did, neither form had a more than minimal impact on the two major selenoproteins: selenoprotein P(SEPP1) and glutathione peroxidase(GPX).},

Since energy metabolism and sleep are controlled by common regulatory factors, consumption of CGA might modulate sleep. Lack of sleep has been identified as a risk factor for obesity, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of ingesting CGA over 5 d on energy metabolism and sleep quality in humans. A total of nine healthy subjects (four male and five female) completed a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, cross-over intervention study. Subjects consumed a test beverage containing 0 or 600 mg of CGA for 5 d. On the fifth night, subjects stayed in a whole-room metabolic chamber to measure energy metabolism; sleep was evaluated using polysomnographic recording. It was found that CGA shortened sleep latency (9 (sem 2) v. 16 (sem 4) min, P{\textless}0·05) compared with the control, whereas no effect on sleep architecture, such as slow-wave sleep, rapid eye movement or waking after sleep onset, was observed. Indirect calorimetry revealed that consumption of CGA increased fat oxidation (510 (sem 84) kJ/8 h (122 (sem 20) kcal/8 h) v. 331 (sem 79) kJ/8 h (81 (sem 19) kcal/8 h), P{\textless}0·05) but did not affect energy expenditure during sleep. Consumption of CGA enhanced parasympathetic activity assessed from heart-rate variability during sleep (999 (sem 77) v. 919 (sem 54), P{\textless}0·05). A period of 5-d CGA consumption significantly increased fat oxidation during sleep, suggesting that beverages containing CGA may be beneficial to reduce body fat and prevent obesity. Consumption of CGA shortened sleep latency and did not adversely affect sleep quality.},

To evaluate the effect of GlcNAc administration on healthy subjects that do not exhibit symptoms of arthritis, the present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed. In the present study, 68 male and female Japanese participants, without symptomatic and radiographic evidence of OA, were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive placebo or GlcNAc (500 or 1,000 mg/day) for 16 weeks. Effects were evaluated using biomarkers for type II collagen degradation and synthesis, collagen type II cleavage (C2C), procollagen type II carboxy-terminal propeptide (PIICP) and their ratio (C2C/PIICP). Furthermore, safety assessments were performed via physical parameters, hematology, blood biochemistry and urinalysis. The results indicated that there was no significant change in the biomarkers for type II collagen degeneration and synthesis during and after the intervention with the placebo and two GlcNAc groups. However, subgroup analysis using subjects with impaired cartilage metabolism (who exhibited enhanced type II collagen degradation and reduced type II collagen synthesis) indicated that the C2C levels were significantly decreased at 8 (P{\textless}0.05) and 16 (P{\textless}0.01) weeks during the intervention in the two GlcNAc (500 mg and 1,000 mg/day) groups, compared with the placebo group. In contrast, PIICP levels were not notably different in the placebo and two GlcNAc groups. The C2C/PIICP ratio was markedly decreased at 12 and 16 weeks during the intervention in the two GlcNAc groups, compared with the placebo group. Moreover, no supplement-related adverse events were observed during and after the intervention. In conclusion, these observations indicate that oral administration of GlcNAc at doses of 500 and 1,000 mg/day improves cartilage metabolism in healthy subjects without apparent adverse effects.},

A scientifically designed approach is necessary for bodybuilders to achieve better results while protecting their health. In this study, we aimed to investigate HRV parameters in bodybuilders compared to healthy control subjects and effects of creatine supplementation. A total of 48 male participants (16 controls, 16 supplement (-), 16 supplement (+)) were evaluated in our study. Bodybuilders who were taking creatine supplementation were enrolled in supplement (+) group. HRV parameters were measured from 24-hour Holter recordings of all participants. When mean heart rates were compared with control group (71.5 ± 12.6 beats/min), statistically significant difference was revealed in supplement (-) group (61.8 ± 6.8 beats/min; P = 0.022) unlike supplement (+) group (69.63 ± 14.1 beats/min; P = 0.650). HRV analyses revealed significant parasympathetic shift in supplement (-) group. No significant difference was demonstrated on HRV parameters, except high frequency (P = 0.029) in supplement (+) group. Conclusively, elevated parasympathetic modulation, which is favorable cardiovascular outcome of exercise, was demonstrated in bodybuilders. However, our study also revealed that creatine supplementation attenuates this favorable effect in ANS by limiting elevation of parasympathetic modulation. Although the sympathetic slight shift is attributed to creatine supplementation, it cannot be discriminated from the effects of over training.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 FAs) have several beneficial effects on cardiovascular (CV) disease risk factors. These effects on CV risk profile may be mediated by several factors, including epigenetic modifications. Our objective is to investigate, using genome-wide DNA methylation analyses, methylation changes following an n-3 FA supplementation in overweight and obese subjects and to identify specific biological pathways potentially altered by the supplementation.
RESULTS: Blood leukocytes genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of 36 overweight and obese subjects before and after a 6-week supplementation with 3 g of n-3 FAs were compared using GenomeStudio software. After supplementation, 308 CpG sites, assigned to 231 genes, were differentially methylated (FDR-corrected Diffscore ≥│13│{\textasciitilde} P ≤ 0.05). Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis system, a total of 55 pathways were significantly overrepresented following supplementation. Among these pathways, 16 were related to inflammatory and immune response, lipid metabolism, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular signaling. Changes in methylation levels of CpG sites within AKT3, ATF1, HDAC4, and IGFBP5 were correlated with changes in plasma triglyceride and glucose levels as well as with changes in the ratio of total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol following the supplementation.
CONCLUSIONS: These data provide key differences in blood leukocytes DNA methylation profiles of subjects following an n-3 FA supplementation, which brings new, potential insights on metabolic pathways underlying the effects of n-3 FAs on CV health.},

RECENT FINDINGS: The most frequently consumed food items, including tofu and seaweeds, are rich in the dietary amino acid l-serine. l-serine content of the Ogimi diet {\textgreater}8 grams/day for Ogimi women significantly exceeds the average American dietary intake of 2.5 grams/day for women {\textgreater}70 years old.
SUMMARY: Our hypothesis that the high l-serine content of the Ogimi diet is related to the paucity of tangle diseases among villagers is buttressed by in vivo results with non-human primates where dietary l-serine slowed development of neurofibrillary tangles and β-amyloid plaques by up to 85\% and a human clinical trial finding that l-serine at 15 grams/day twice daily slows functional decline in ALS patients. Analysis of the Ogimi diet suggests that l-serine should be evaluated for therapeutic potential as a neuroprotective agent.},

A double-blind, parallel, randomized clinical trial, reported here and previously submitted to regulatory agencies, helps to clarify the role of sucralose in this regard. This was primarily an out-patient study, with 4-week screening, 12-week test, and 4-week follow-up phases. Normoglycemic male volunteers (47) consumed ∼333.3 mg encapsulated sucralose or placebo 3x/day at mealtimes. HbA1c, fasting glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were measured weekly. OGTTs were conducted in-clinic overnight, following overnight fasting twice during screening phase, twice during test phase, and once at follow-up. Throughout the study, glucose, insulin, C-peptide and HbA1c levels were within normal range. No statistically significant differences between sucralose and placebo groups in change from baseline for fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide and HbA1c, no clinically meaningful differences in time to peak levels or return towards basal levels in OGTTs, and no treatment group differences in mean glucose, insulin, or C-peptide AUC change from baseline were observed. The results of other relevant clinical trials and studies of gastrointestinal sweet taste receptors are compared to these findings. The collective evidence supports that sucralose has no effect on glycemic control.},

Although many favorable cardiovascular effects in vitro are mediated by epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), its contribution to the beneficial effects of tea in vivo remains unresolved. In a randomised crossover study, a single dose of 200 mg EGCG was applied in three different formulas (as green tea beverage, green tea extract (GTE), and isolated EGCG) to 50 healthy men. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and endothelial-independent nitro-mediated dilation (NMD) was measured before and two hours after ingestion. Plasma levels of tea compounds were determined after each intervention and correlated with FMD. FMD significantly improved after consumption of green tea containing 200 mg EGCG (p {\textless} 0.01). However, GTE and EGCG had no significant effect on FMD. NMD did not significantly differ between interventions. EGCG plasma levels were highest after administration of EGCG and lowest after consumption of green tea. Plasma levels of caffeine increased after green tea consumption. The results show that EGCG is most likely not involved in improvement of flow-mediated dilation by green tea. Instead, other tea compounds, metabolites or combinations thereof may play a role.},

Lower plasma nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) and interleukin (IL)-6 were observed in exposed workers compared to the reference group. Resveratrol significantly reversed the adverse impacts of ELF-EMF. Stimulated cytokine production by resveratrol was found in exposed workers but not in the reference group.

Since free radicals are essential for brain physiological processes and pathological degeneration, research focusing on the possible influence of the EMFs-driven oxidative stress is still in progress, especially in the light of recent studies suggesting that EMFs may contribute to the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders. This review synthesizes the emerging evidences about this topic, highlighting the wide data uncertainty that still characterizes the EMFs effect on oxidative stress modulation, as both pro-oxidant and neuroprotective effects have been documented.

Moreover, the fucoxanthin-triggered modification significantly reduced the neurotoxicity of Aβ oligomers in vitro. Molecular dynamics simulation analysis further revealed a hydrophobic interaction between fucoxanthin and Aβ peptide, which might prevent the conformational transition and self-assembly of Aβ. Most importantly, fucoxanthin could attenuate cognitive impairments in Aβ oligomer-injected mice. In addition, fucoxanthin significantly inhibited oxidative stress, enhanced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and increased ChAT-positive regions in the hippocampus of mice. On the basis of these novel findings, we anticipated that fucoxanthin might ameliorate AD via inhibiting Aβ assembly and attenuating Aβ neurotoxicity.},

OBJECTIVE: Hence, to support of our previous studies about anti-aging effects of Ursolic Acid (UA), a compound which extensively present in apple peels. The aim of this study is to address whether UA might alter sensors of the cell metabolic state such as SIRT1, SIRT6, PGC-1β and Klotho proteins.
METHODS: To evaluate the effect of UA on hepatic indicated proteins, mice were administrated with UA twice daily for 7 days. The involvements of these proteins in the UA-mediated effect harmony hepatic protection were investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy technique.
RESULTS: Our findings clearly illustrated that UA enhanced SIRT1 ({\textasciitilde} 5 ± 0.2 folds) and SIRT6 ({\textasciitilde} 8 ± 0.5 folds) proteins levels in hepatic, p\&lt;0.001. In addition, the data showed that UA increased PGC-1β ({\textasciitilde} 7 ± 0.4 folds) protein overexpression, p\&lt;0.001. Moreover, we showed that UA up-regulated Klotho ({\textasciitilde} 3.5 ± 0.2 folds) protein in order to improve hepatic performance, p\&lt;0.01.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that UA through increasing of SIRT1 up-regulation ameliorate reverse cholesterol transport, fatty acid use and oxidative stress defense. In addition, it seems that UA by enhancing of SIRT6 expression promotes cholesterol homeostasis through repressing of SREBP1 and SREBP2. Reciprocally, UA might be involved in VLDL synthesis and exportation through PGC-1β up-regulation. Finally, UA might be as key regulators of mineral homeostasis and bile acid/cholesterol metabolism, by inducing of Klotho overexpression.},

Thus, our objectives were to determine and compare levels of glutathione, as well as ergothioneine, in different species of mushrooms. Glutathione levels varied {\textgreater}20-fold (0.11-2.41mg/gdw) with some varieties having higher levels than reported for other foods. Ergothioneine levels also varied widely (0.15-7.27mg/gdw) and were highly correlated with those of glutathione (r=0.62, P{\textless}0.001). Both antioxidants were more concentrated in pileus than stipe tissues in selected mushrooms species. Agaricus bisporus harvested during the third cropping flush contained higher levels of ergothioneine and glutathione compared to the first flush, possibly as a response to increased oxidative stress. This study demonstrated that certain mushroom species are high in glutathione and ergothioneine and should be considered an excellent dietary source of these important antioxidants.},

Participants received 54 mg/day of genistein (n = 11) or placebo (n = 11) in combination with a Mediterranean-style diet and regular exercise. Left ventricular (LV) systolic function was assessed as the primary endpoint, according to conventional and strain-echocardiography measurements. Also, left atrial (LA) morphofunctional indices were investigated at baseline and at the final visit. Results were expressed as median with interquartile range (IQ). A significant improvement of LV ejection fraction (20.3 (IQ 12.5) vs. -1.67 (IQ 24.8); p = 0.040)), and LA area fractional change (11.1 (IQ 22.6) vs. 2.8 (9.5); p = 0.034)) were observed in genistein patients compared to the controls, following 12 months of treatment. In addition, body surface area indexed LA systolic volume and peak LA longitudinal strain significantly changed from basal to the end of the study in genistein-treated patients. One-year supplementation with 54 mg/day of pure genistein improved both LV ejection fraction and LA remodeling and function in postmenopausal women with MetS.},

We assessed how serum hippuric acid changes after a bilberry-enriched diet (BB; high anthocyanin intake) and another berry diet including strawberries, raspberries, and cloudberries (SRC; lower anthocyanin intake) and how these changes associate with insulin and glucose metabolism.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Hippuric acid was measured with LC-QTOF-MS metabolite profiling analysis from fasting serum samples at baseline and after an 8-week intervention in 47 individuals with features of the metabolic syndrome who were randomized to either a BB diet (n = 15), an SRC diet (n = 20) or a control diet (n = 12). Fasting serum hippuric acid increased significantly (3.5-fold, p = 0.001) only in the BB group and correlated with changes in fasting plasma glucose concentration (r = -0.54, p {\textless} 0.05) and insulin secretion (r = 0.59, p {\textless} 0.05). These associations were confirmed in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (n = 198).
CONCLUSION: Fasting serum hippuric acid is increased after consumption of anthocyanin-rich bilberries, and may contribute to the beneficial effect of bilberry consumption through its associations with better glycemic control and β-cell function.},

	abstract = {In a randomized trial of folic acid supplementation for the prevention of colorectal adenomas, we previously found indications of increased risk during later treatment and follow-up. This could have been due to the unmetabolized folic acid (UFA) or natural reduced and methylated folates (mF) to which it is metabolized. In post hoc analyses, we measured mF (the sum of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate and 4-alfa-hydroxy-5-methyl-THF) and UFA concentrations in the serum of 924 participants. Using binomial regression models with a log link, we assessed the associations between plasma mF or UFA and adenoma occurrence. We found no association between plasma mF or UFA and overall adenoma risk. However, during later follow-up, the prespecified, composite endpoint of high-risk findings (advanced or multiple adenomas) was positively associated with plasma mF (Plinear trend = 0.009), with a 58\% increased risk for participants in the upper versus lowest quartile. An irregular association was seen with plasma UFA, with suggestions of an inverse trend (Plinear trend=0.049). A modest, significant inverse association was also seen between mF and risk of serrated lesions, with a 39\% lower risk for upper versus lower quartile participants (Plinear trend = 0.03). In conclusion, during the later follow-up period in which folic acid supplementation was previously seen to increase the risk of advanced and multiple adenomas, higher serum mF was associated with a higher risk of multiple and/or advanced adenomas, but no clear indication that UFA played a direct role. There were indications that higher mF was associated with reduced risk of serrated polyps. Cancer Prev Res; 10(8); 451-8. Â©2017 AACR.},

The anticancer properties of resveratrol have been attributed to a variety of mechanisms, including its general inhibition of phase I metabolism and induction of phase II metabolism. The effects of resveratrol on these enzymes, however, are still unclear, as inÂ vitro evidence often contrasts with animal studies and clinical trials. Reasons for these variances could include the low bioavailability of resveratrol and the effects of resveratrol metabolites. Due to resveratrol's interactions with drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, individuals concurrently taking pharmacological doses of resveratrol with other supplements or medications could potentially experience nutrient-drug interactions. This review summarizes the known effects of resveratrol and its main metabolites on drug metabolism in order to help characterize which populations might benefit from resveratrol for the prevention of cancer, as well as those that may need to avoid supplementation due to potential drug interactions.},

Blueberry leaves are byproducts of the blueberry industry, which are rich in bioactive phenolics, such as quercetin (Q), hyperin (H), and chlorogenic acid (C). This study investigated protective effects of 3 phenolics (Q, H, and C) from leaves of rabbiteye blueberry Vaccinium ashei on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The results showed that all these 3 phenolics could improve endothelial function by inhibiting oxidative damage and proinflammatory cytokines caused by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The cell vitalities of endothelial cells pretreated with Q, H, and C were higher than those stimulated with TNF-α only. These phenolics could decrease reactive oxygen species and xanthine oxidase-1 levels and increase superoxide dismutase and heme oxygenase-1 levels in endothelial cells. They also could decrease the protein expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 induced by TNF-α. In addition, Q, H, and C also exhibited vasodilatory effect by reducing the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) protein levels in endothelial cells. Mostly 3 phenolics exhibited bioactivities as a function of concentration, but the effects not always depended on the concentration. The antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects of Q seemed to be more pronounced than H; however, H exhibited higher cell vitalities. The results indicated that phenolics from rabbiteye blueberry leaves could be potential antioxidants, inflammation and ACE inhibitors, and rabbiteye blueberry leaves provide a new resources of phytochemicals beneficial for cardiovascular health.},

The inhibition on MDA-MB-231 cells of fractions from "Noble" was further evaluated. The results showed that polyphenols from 2 grape pomaces could be separated into 3 fractions, and ellagic acid and/or ellagitannins were only detected in fractions from "Noble" pomace. All 3 fractions from "Noble" pomace inhibited MDA-MB-231 better than MCF-7. But fraction 2 from "Cabernet Sauvignon" inhibited MCF-7 better while fraction 1 and fraction 3 inhibited both 2 cells similarly. Moreover, the fractions from "Noble" pomace rather than "Cabernet Sauvignon" can inhibit MDA-MB-231 better. Finally, fractions from "Noble" pomace can induce S-phase arrest and apoptosis on MDA-MB-231.

The response of Caco-2 cells following exposure to a mixture of inflammatory mediators [interleukin [IL]-1β, 25 ng/mL; lipopolysaccharides [LPS], 10 ng/mL; tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, 50 ng/mL; and interferon [INF]-γ, 50 ng/mL] were assessed by measuring the levels of secreted IL-6 and IL-8. In addition, the mRNA levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase were measured. Moreover, the degree of nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibition was examined, and the intestinal barrier function was determined by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran transfer. It was observed that ginger extract and its constituents improved inflammatory responses by decreasing the levels of nitrite, PGE2, IL-6, and IL-8 via NF-κB inhibition. The ginger extract also increased the TEER and decreased the transfer of FITC-dextran from the apical side of the epithelium to the basolateral side. Taken together, these results show that ginger extract may be developed as a functional food for the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.},

METHODS: The DII was computed at baseline from a validated 80-item food frequency questionnaire in a cohort of 49 258 women, among whom 1895 incident BrCa cases were identified through linkage with the National Cancer Registry through 2011. We used multivariable Cox proportional models to estimate hazard ratios (HR).
RESULTS: Positive associations were observed between DII and BrCa (HRDII quartile 4 vs 1=1.18; 95\% CI: 1.00, 1.39), with somewhat stronger associations in postmenopausal women (HRDII quartile 4 vs 1=1.22; 95\% CI: 1.01, 1.46).
CONCLUSIONS: A proinflammatory diet appears to increase the risk of developing BrCa, especially in postmenopausal women.},

	abstract = {SCOPE: Zinc is an essential mineral that plays an important role in the body. We previously reported that orally feeding zinc-enriched yeast to mice induces nonrapid-eye-movement sleep. In addition, astaxanthin, an antioxidant abundant in seafood such as salmon and krill, is able to chelate minerals and may promote zinc absorption, which in return may also improve sleep. The purpose of our study was to examine the effect of zinc-rich and astaxanthin-containing food on sleep in humans.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled parallel group trial of 120 healthy subjects and recorded their night activity by actigraphy for 12 weeks. These subjects were divided into four groups: placebo, zinc-rich food, zinc-, and astaxanthin-rich food, and placebo supplemented with zinc-enriched yeast and astaxanthin oil. Compared with the placebo group, the zinc-rich food group efficiently decreased the time necessary to fall asleep and improved sleep efficiency, whereas the group that ingested zinc-enriched yeast and astaxanthin oil significantly improved the sleep onset latency.
CONCLUSION: Actigraphic sleep monitoring demonstrated that eating zinc-rich food improved sleep onset latency as well as improved the sleep efficiency in healthy individuals.},

Potato consumption (including fried and unfried potatoes) was analyzed by using a Block Brief 2000 food-frequency questionnaire and categorized as ≤1 time/mo, 2-3 times/mo, 1 time/wk, 2 times/wk, or ≥3 times/wk. Mortality was ascertained through validated cases of death. To investigate the association between potato consumption and mortality, Cox regression models were constructed to estimate HRs with 95\% CIs, with adjustment for potential confounders.Results: Of the 4400 participants, 2551 (57.9\%) were women with a mean ± SD age of 61.3 ± 9.2 y. During the 8-y follow-up, 236 participants died. After adjustment for 14 potential baseline confounders, and taking those with the lowest consumption of potatoes as the reference group, participants with the highest consumption of potatoes did not show an increased risk of overall mortality (HR: 1.11; 95\% CI: 0.65, 1.91). However, subgroup analyses indicated that participants who consumed fried potatoes 2-3 times/wk (HR: 1.95; 95\% CI: 1.11, 3.41) and ≥3 times/wk (HR: 2.26; 95\% CI: 1.15, 4.47) were at an increased risk of mortality. The consumption of unfried potatoes was not associated with an increased mortality risk.Conclusions: The frequent consumption of fried potatoes appears to be associated with an increased mortality risk. Additional studies in larger sample sizes should be performed to confirm if overall potato consumption is associated with higher mortality risk.

METHODS: We investigated the effect of oral cinnamon consumption on body composition and metabolic parameters of Asian Indians with metabolic syndrome. In this 16-week double blind randomized control trial, 116 individuals with metabolic syndrome were randomized to two dietary intervention groups, cinnamon [6 capsules (3 g) daily] or wheat flour [6 capsules (2.5 g) daily]. Body composition, blood pressure and metabolic parameters were assessed.
RESULTS: Significantly greater decrease [difference between means, (95\% CI)] in fasting blood glucose (mmol/L) [0.3 (0.2, 0.5) p = 0.001], glycosylated haemoglobin (mmol/mol) [2.6 (0.4, 4.9) p = 0.023], waist circumference (cm) [4.8 (1.9, 7.7) p = 0.002] and body mass index (kg/m2 ) [1.3 (0.9, 1.5) p = 0.001] was observed in the cinnamon group compared to placebo group. Other parameters which showed significantly greater improvement were: waist-hip ratio, blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Prevalence of defined metabolic syndrome was significantly reduced in the intervention group (34.5\%) vs. the placebo group (5.2\%).
CONCLUSION: A single supplement intervention with 3 g cinnamon for 16 weeks resulted in significant improvements in all components of metabolic syndrome in a sample of Asian Indians in north India.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The clinical trial was retrospectively registered (after the recruitment of the participants) in ClinicalTrial.gov under the identification number: NCT02455778 on 25th May 2015.},

	abstract = {Ovarian cancer (OC) is the sixth and eighth leading cause of cancer mortality among women in developed and developing countries, respectively. Medical therapy is the main method for the treatment of OC. However, drug toxicity and the marked side effects of chemotherapy limit the usage and therapeutic results of the treatments. Therefore, the identification of multi-target agents with few side effects and high effectiveness is required. Traditional Chinese medicine has been used clinically to treat various types of cancer for thousands of years and is considered to possess multiple components and agents, which exert efficient therapeutic functions with few side effects. Although blueberries have previously been used to treat various types of cancer, the effect on OC and precise molecular mechanism of function of the fruit remains unknown. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 have been reported to be the biomarkers of OC. Blueberries may affect the progression of OC by affecting COX levels. To investigate the issue, COX-1 and COX-2 were overexpressed or silenced in ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells. The effect of blueberries on SKOV3 cell viability was determined by an MTT assay. Furthermore, a mouse model for OC was established. The results indicated that blueberries inhibited the proliferation of OC cells by downregulating the levels of COX-1 and COX-2. Blueberry (400 mg daily) consumption reduced tumor size significantly in mice with OC compared with the control without blueberry treatment (P{\textless}0.05). The results suggest that blueberries should be used to develop a potential non-pharmaceutical therapy for OC.},

	abstract = {KEY POINTS: Mechanotransduction in endothelial cells is a central mechanism in the regulation of vascular tone and vascular remodelling Mechanotransduction and vascular function may be affected by high sugar levels in plasma because of a resulting increase in oxidative stress and increased levels of advanced glycation end-products (AGE). In healthy young subjects, 2 weeks of daily supplementation with 3 × 75 g of sucrose was found to reduce blood flow in response to passive lower leg movement and in response to 12 W of knee extensor exercise. This vascular impairment was paralleled by up-regulation of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, NADPH oxidase and Rho family GTPase Rac1 protein expression, an increased basal phosphorylation status of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and a reduced phosphorylation status of PECAM-1. There were no measurable changes in AGE levels. The findings of the present study demonstrate that daily high sucrose intake markedly affects mechanotransduction proteins and has a detrimental effect on vascular function.
ABSTRACT: Endothelial mechanotransduction is important for vascular function but alterations and activation of vascular mechanosensory proteins have not been investigated in humans. In endothelial cell culture, simple sugars effectively impair mechanosensor proteins. To study mechanosensor- and vascular function in humans, 12 young healthy male subjects supplemented their diet with 3 × 75 g sucrose day-1 for 14 days in a randomized cross-over design. Before and after the intervention period, the hyperaemic response to passive lower leg movement and active knee extensor exercise was determined by ultrasound doppler. A muscle biopsy was obtained from the thigh muscle before and after acute passive leg movement to allow assessment of protein amounts and the phosphorylation status of mechanosensory proteins and NADPH oxidase. The sucrose intervention led to a reduced flow response to passive movement (by 17 ± 2\%) and to 12 W of active exercise (by 9 ± 1\%), indicating impaired vascular function. A reduced flow response to passive and active exercise was paralleled by a significant up-regulation of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), endothelial nitric oxide synthase, NADPH oxidase and the Rho family GTPase Rac1 protein expression in the muscle tissue, as well as an increased basal phosphorylation status of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and a reduced phosphorylation status of PECAM-1. The phosphorylation status was not acutely altered with passive leg movement. These findings indicate that a regular intake of high levels of sucrose can impair vascular mechanotransduction and increase the oxidative stress potential, and suggest that dietary excessive sugar intake may contribute to the development of vascular disease.},

This study investigated the effects of SP on the function and redox status of the auditory system. Auditory brainstem responses and redox status were compared between two groups of 3-month-old senescence-accelerated prone-8 (SAMP8) mice: the control group was fed a normal diet, and the experimental group was fed a normal diet with oral supplementation of SP for 6 weeks. Compared with the control group, the experimental group had significantly lower hearing thresholds according to auditory brainstem responses measured using click sounds and 8-kHz tone burst sound stimulation at the end of this study. The experimental group had a shorter I-III interval of auditory brainstem responses with 16-kHz tone burst stimulation than the control group that was of borderline significance. Additionally, the experimental group had significantly higher mRNA expression of the superoxide dismutase and catalase genes in the cochlea and brainstem and significantly higher mRNA expression of the glutathione peroxidase gene in the cochlea. Further, the experimental group had significantly lower malondialdehyde levels in the cochlea and brainstem than the control group. However, tumor necrosis factor-Î± mRNA expression was not significantly different between the control and experimental groups. SP could decrease hearing degeneration in senescence-accelerated prone-8 mice possibly by increasing superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase gene expression and decreasing damage from oxidative stress in the cochlea and brainstem.},

Spirulina, a cyanobacterium used as a food additive or food supplement, has been shown to impact immune function. We have tested the potential hepatoprotective effect of a Spirulina in aged mice and to determine whether these effects can be related to a modulation of the gut microbiota. Old mice have been fed a standard diet supplemented with or without 5\% Spirulina for six weeks. Among several changes of gut microbiota composition, an increase in Roseburia and Lactobacillus proportions occurs upon Spirulina treatment. Interestingly, parameters related to the innate immunity are upregulated in the small intestine of Spirulina-treated mice. Furthermore, the supplementation with Spirulina reduces several hepatic inflammatory and oxidative stress markers that are upregulated in old mice versus young mice. We conclude that the oral administration of a Spirulina is able to modulate the gut microbiota and to activate the immune system in the gut, a mechanism that may be involved in the improvement of the hepatic inflammation in aged mice. Those data open the way to new therapeutic tools in the management of immune alterations in aging, based on gut microbe-host interactions.},

We observed that, during the postexercise recovery period, GTE supplementation elicited an increase in energy reliance on fat oxidation compared with the placebo trial (P{\textless}0·05), although there were no differences in blood glucose and insulin responses between the two trials. In summary, 8-week oral GTE supplementation increases postexercise systemic fat oxidation and exercise-induced muscle GLUT4 protein content in response to an acute bout of endurance exercise.

	abstract = {Background • Vitamin K1 and K2 are not typically common in a Western diet because they are found in a variety of fermented foods. Vitamin K2 in particular has been demonstrated to restore mitochondrial function and has a key role in production of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that dietary supplementation with vitamin K2 could increase the function of muscle with high mitochondrial content (ie, skeletal and cardiac muscle). Objective • The purpose of this study was to determine if 8 wk of dietary supplementation with Vitamin K2 could alter cardiovascular responses to a graded cycle ergometer test. Design • The study was a randomized controlled trial. Setting • The study took place in the Applied Physiology Laboratory of the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of North Texas (Denton, TX, USA). Participants • Participants were aerobically trained males and female athletes (N = 26). Intervention • Participants were randomly assigned either to a control group that received a rice flour placebo or to an intervention group that received vitamin K2. For weeks 1 to 4, participants received 300 mg/d; for weeks 5 to 8, they received 150 mg/d. Subjects assigned to the control group received similar doses to mirror the intervention group. Subjects consumed the supplements during an 8-wk period while they maintained their typical exercise habits. Outcome Measures • At baseline and postintervention, participants completed a standard, graded exercise test on an electronically braked cycle ergometer. Before the test, participants were fitted with a mouth piece, and their oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, respiratory rate, and respiratory exchange ratio were measured. In addition, participants were fitted with skin-mounted electrodes that measured noninvasive cardiac output, stroke volume, and heart rate. To assess the cumulative exercise change, an area-under-the-curve (AUC) value was calculated separately for each outcome variable at each treatment time point. Results • Vitamin K2 supplementation was associated with a 12\% increase in maximal cardiac output, with P = .031, with a trend toward an increase in heart-rate AUC, with P = .070. No significant changes occurred in stroke volume. Conclusions • Although vitamin K2 supplementation has previously been reported to improve cardiovascular function in diseased patients, to the research team's knowledge, the current study is the first to report its potential in active individuals. More research is needed to fully evaluate the potential effects of the observed effects.},

	abstract = {Current treatment options for depression are limited by efficacy, cost, availability, side effects, and acceptability to patients. Several studies have looked at the association between magnesium and depression, yet its role in symptom management is unclear. The objective of this trial was to test whether supplementation with over-the-counter magnesium chloride improves symptoms of depression. An open-label, blocked, randomized, cross-over trial was carried out in outpatient primary care clinics on 126 adults (mean age 52; 38\% male) diagnosed with and currently experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores of 5-19. The intervention was 6 weeks of active treatment (248 mg of elemental magnesium per day) compared to 6 weeks of control (no treatment). Assessments of depression symptoms were completed at bi-weekly phone calls. The primary outcome was the net difference in the change in depression symptoms from baseline to the end of each treatment period. Secondary outcomes included changes in anxiety symptoms as well as adherence to the supplement regimen, appearance of adverse effects, and intention to use magnesium supplements in the future. Between June 2015 and May 2016, 112 participants provided analyzable data. Consumption of magnesium chloride for 6 weeks resulted in a clinically significant net improvement in PHQ-9 scores of -6.0 points (CI -7.9, -4.2; P{\textless}0.001) and net improvement in Generalized Anxiety Disorders-7 scores of -4.5 points (CI -6.6, -2.4; P{\textless}0.001). Average adherence was 83\% by pill count. The supplements were well tolerated and 61\% of participants reported they would use magnesium in the future. Similar effects were observed regardless of age, gender, baseline severity of depression, baseline magnesium level, or use of antidepressant treatments. Effects were observed within two weeks. Magnesium is effective for mild-to-moderate depression in adults. It works quickly and is well tolerated without the need for close monitoring for toxicity.},

In this study, extracts generated from five brown algae (Fucus dichitus, Fucus vesiculosus (Linnaeus), Cytoseira tamariscofolia, Cytoseira nodacaulis, Alaria esculenta) were tested for their ability to activate SIRT6 resulting in H3K9 deacetylation. Three of the five macroalgal extracts caused a significant increase of H3K9 deacetylation, and the effect was most pronounced for F. dichitus. The compound responsible for this in vitro activity was identified by mass spectrometry as fucoidan.},

Ten resistance-trained men (age= 22.7±4.0 yrs, weight= 82.3±9.6 kg, height= 1.75±0.1 cm) completed two randomized, double-blind trials: Capsaicin condition (12mg) or a placebo condition. Forty five minutes after supplement consumption, subjects performed four sets until movement failure in the squat exercise at 70\% of 1RM with 90 seconds of rest interval between sets. The total weight lifted (total repetitions x weight lifted) was calculated. The rate of perceived exertion (RPE) was recorded after the last set. Blood lactate was analyzed after each set of exercise, immediately post exercise, and after three, five and at 30 minutes during recovery. The number of repetitions in each set decreased significantly after all sets compared to set-1 and after set-3 and set-4 in relation to set-2 (p{\textless}0.001), however total weight lifted was higher in capsaicin compared to placebo (3919.4 + 1227.4 kg vs 3179.6 + 942.4 kg, p=0.002). Blood lactate increased significantly following each set (p{\textless}0.001); however, there were no differences between conditions. RPE was significantly less for the capsaicin condition than placebo (17.2 + 1.0 vs 18.3 + 1.7, p=0.048). In summary, acute capsaicin supplementation improves lower body resistance training performance in trained young men.},

	abstract = {The mechanism by which high-salt and low-potassium diet contributes to hypertension remains poorly understood. Plasma homocysteine (Hcys) is recognized as a primary mediator of blood pressure (BP) response to some diets. Therefore, the present study tried to investigate whether plasma Hcys and BP could be regulated by salt loading in normotensive salt-sensitive (SS) persons, and further explored whether potassium supplementation could reverse the effect. We enrolled 47 normotensive subjects, aged 29-65 years. The protocol included 7 days on a low-salt diet (3g/day, NaCl), 7 days on a high-salt diet (18g/day), and then a high-salt diet with potassium supplementation (4.5g/day) for 7 days. After high-salt intake, BP was significantly increased and potassium supplementation lowered it in the SS group. Plasma Hcys were higher in SS subjects than in salt-resistant (SR) subjects after salt loading (34.4 ± 17.0 μmol/L versus 19.16 ± 6.4 μmol/L, P {\textless} 0.01). Plasma Hcys in SS subjects was increased on a high-salt diet than on a low-salt diet (34.4 ± 17.0 μmol/L versus 16.5 ± 8.3 μmol/L, P {\textless} 0.01), but plasma Hcys was ameliorated by potassium supplementation (34.4 ± 17.0 μmol/L versus 20.9 ± 10.4 μmol/L, P {\textless} 0.01). In SS subjects, the change of mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) correlated significantly and positively with the alteration of plasma Hcys during low-salt to high-salt intake and high-salt to high-salt with potassium supplementation (r = 0.75, P {\textless} 0.001; r = 0.74, P {\textless} 0.001, respectively). Our results indicate that Hcys may partly mediate the impact of high-salt intake and potassium supplementation on BP in SS subjects.},

	abstract = {Dietary nitrate supplementation enhances sea level performance and may ameliorate hypoxemia at high altitude. However, nitrate may exacerbate acute mountain sickness (AMS), specifically headache. This study investigated the effect of nitrate supplementation on AMS symptoms and exercise responses with 6-h hypoxia. Twenty recreationally active men [age, 22 ± 4 yr, maximal oxygen consumption (V̇o2max), 51 ± 6 ml·min-1·kg-1, means ± SD] completed this randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover study. Twelve participants were classified as AMS- on the basis of Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire [Acute Cerebral Mountain Sickness score (AMS-C)] {\textless}0.7 in both trials, and five participants were classified as AMS+ on the basis of AMS-C ≥0.7 on placebo. Five days of nitrate supplementation (70-ml beetroot juice containing {\textasciitilde}6.4 mmol nitrate daily) increased plasma NO metabolites by 182 µM compared with placebo but did not reduce AMS or improve exercise performance. After 4-h hypoxia [inspired O2 fraction ([Formula: see text]) = 0.124], nitrate increased AMS-C and headache severity (visual analog scale; whole sample ∆10 [1, 20] mm, mean difference [95\% confidence interval]; P = 0.03) compared with placebo. In addition, after 5-h hypoxia, nitrate increased sense of effort during submaximal exercise (∆7 [-1, 14]; P = 0.07). In AMS-, nitrate did not alter headache or sense of effort. In contrast, in AMS+, nitrate increased headache severity (∆26 [-3, 56] mm; P = 0.07), sense of effort (∆14 [1, 28]; P = 0.04), oxygen consumption, ventilation, and mean arterial pressure during submaximal exercise. On the next day, in a separate acute hypoxic exercise test ([Formula: see text] = 0.141), nitrate did not improve time to exhaustion at 80\% hypoxic V̇o2max In conclusion, dietary nitrate increases AMS and sense of effort during exercise, particularly in those who experience AMS. Dietary nitrate is therefore not recommended as an AMS prophylactic or ergogenic aid in nonacclimatized individuals at altitude.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to identify that the popular dietary nitrate supplement (beetroot) does not reduce acute mountain sickness (AMS) or improve exercise performance during 6-h hypoxia. The consumption of nitrate in those susceptible to AMS exacerbates AMS symptoms (headache) and sense of effort and raises oxygen cost, ventilation, and blood pressure during walking exercise in 6-h hypoxia. These data question the suitability of nitrate supplementation during altitude travel in nonacclimatized people.},

Based on earlier results with fisetin in transgenic AD mice, we hypothesized that fisetin would be effective against brain aging and cognitive dysfunction in rapidly aging senescence-accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mice, a model for sporadic AD and dementia. An integrative approach was used to correlate protein expression and metabolite levels in the brain with cognition. It was found that fisetin reduced cognitive deficits in old SAMP8 mice while restoring multiple markers associated with impaired synaptic function, stress, and inflammation. These results provide further evidence for the potential benefits of fisetin for the treatment of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a major lipid signalling network that plays important pro-homeostatic (allostatic) roles not only in the nervous system but also in peripheral organs. There is increasing evidence that there is a dietary component in the modulation of the ECS. Cannabinoid receptors in hominids co-evolved with diet, and the ECS constitutes a feedback loop for food selection and energy metabolism. Here, it is postulated that the mismatch of ancient lipid genes of hunter-gatherers and pastoralists with the high-carbohydrate diet introduced by agriculture could be compensated for via dietary modulation of the ECS. In addition to the fatty acid precursors of endocannabinoids, the potential role of dietary cannabimimetic phytochemicals in agriculturist nutrition is discussed. Dietary secondary metabolites from vegetables and spices able to enhance the activity of cannabinoid-type 2 (CB2 ) receptors may provide adaptive metabolic advantages and counteract inflammation. In contrast, chronic CB1 receptor activation in hedonic obese individuals may enhance pathophysiological processes related to hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, hepatorenal inflammation and cardiometabolic risk. Food able to modulate the CB1 /CB2 receptor activation ratio may thus play a role in the nutrition transition of Western high-calorie diets. In this review, the interplay between diet and the ECS is highlighted from an evolutionary perspective. The emerging potential of cannabimimetic food as a nutraceutical strategy is critically discussed.

	abstract = {Clinical studies suggest that diets rich in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) provide beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, in part through their conversion to bioactive metabolites. Here we report on the endogenous production of a previously unknown class of ω-3 PUFA-derived lipid metabolites that originate from the crosstalk between endocannabinoid and cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase metabolic pathways. The ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides are derived from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to form epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid-ethanolamide (EEQ-EA) and epoxydocosapentaenoic acid-ethanolamide (EDP-EA), respectively. Both EEQ-EAs and EDP-EAs are endogenously present in rat brain and peripheral organs as determined via targeted lipidomics methods. These metabolites were directly produced by direct epoxygenation of the ω-3 endocannabinoids, docosahexanoyl ethanolamide (DHEA) and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide (EPEA) by activated BV-2 microglial cells, and by human CYP2J2. Neuroinflammation studies revealed that the terminal epoxides 17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA dose-dependently abated proinflammatory IL-6 cytokines while increasing anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokines, in part through cannabinoid receptor-2 activation. Furthermore the ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides 17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA exerted antiangiogenic effects in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) and vasodilatory actions on bovine coronary arteries and reciprocally regulated platelet aggregation in washed human platelets. Taken together, the ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides' physiological effects are mediated through both endocannabinoid and epoxyeicosanoid signaling pathways. In summary, the ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides are found at concentrations comparable to those of other endocannabinoids and are expected to play critical roles during inflammation in vivo; thus their identification may aid in the development of therapeutics for neuroinflammatory and cerebrovascular diseases.},

However, the mechanisms involved in this protective action remain to be fully elucidated. Methods Herein, we investigated the effect of daily consumption of EVOO on the AD-like phenotype of a mouse mode of the disease with plaques and tangles. Results Triple transgenic mice (3xTg) received either regular chow or a chow diet supplemented with EVOO starting at 6 months of age for 6 months, then assessed for the effect of the diet on the AD-like neuropathology and behavioral changes. Compared with controls, mice receiving the EVOO-rich diet had an amelioration of their behavioral deficits, and a significant increase in the steady state levels of synaptophysin, a protein marker of synaptic integrity. In addition, they had a significant reduction in insoluble Aβ peptide levels and deposition, lower amount of phosphorylated tau protein at specific epitopes, which were secondary to an activation of cell autophagy. Interpretation Taken together, our findings support a beneficial effect of EVOO consumption on all major features of the AD phenotype (behavioral deficits, synaptic pathology, Aβ and tau neuropathology), and demonstrate that autophagy activation is the mechanism underlying these biological actions.},

Therefore, the effects of increasing egg intake (0, 1, 2, and 3 eggs/day) on these and other CVD risk biomarkers were evaluated in a young, healthy population. Thirty-eight subjects [19 men/19 women, 24.1 ± 2.2 years, body mass index (BMI) 24.3 ± 2.5 kg/m2] participated in this 14-week crossover intervention.

Anthropometric data, blood pressure (BP), dietary records, and plasma biomarkers (lipids, glucose, choline, and TMAO) were measured during each intervention phase. BMI, waist circumference, systolic BP, plasma glucose, and plasma triacylglycerol did not change throughout the intervention. Diastolic BP decreased with egg intake (P {\textless} 0.05). Compared to 0 eggs/day, intake of 1 egg/day increased HDL cholesterol (HDL-c) (P {\textless} 0.05), and decreased LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) (P {\textless} 0.05) and the LDL-c/HDL-c ratio (P {\textless} 0.01). With intake of 2-3 eggs/day, these changes were maintained. Plasma choline increased dose-dependently with egg intake (P {\textless} 0.0001) while fasting plasma TMAO was unchanged. These results indicate that in a healthy population, consuming up to 3 eggs/day results in an overall beneficial effect on biomarkers associated with CVD risk, as documented by increased HDL-c, a reduced LDL-c/HDL-c ratio, and increased plasma choline in combination with no change in plasma LDL-c or TMAO concentrations.},

METHODS: This cohort study was based on data from the Danish Health Examination Survey 2007-2008. Of the 76,484 survey participants, 28,704 men and 41,847 women were eligible for this study. Participants were followed for a median of 4.9 years. Self-reported questionnaires were used to obtain information on alcohol drinking patterns, i.e. frequency of alcohol drinking, frequency of binge drinking, and consumption of wine, beer and spirits, from which we calculated beverage-specific and overall average weekly alcohol intake. Information on incident cases of diabetes was obtained from the Danish National Diabetes Register. Cox proportional hazards model was applied to estimate HRs and 95\% CIs.
RESULTS: During follow-up, 859 men and 887 women developed diabetes. The lowest risk of diabetes was observed at 14 drinks/week in men (HR 0.57 [95\% CI 0.47, 0.70]) and at 9 drinks/week in women (HR 0.42 [95\% CI 0.35, 0.51]), relative to no alcohol intake. Compared with current alcohol consumers consuming {\textless}1 day/week, consumption of alcohol on 3-4 days weekly was associated with significantly lower risk for diabetes in men (HR 0.73 [95\% CI 0.59, 0.94]) and women (HR 0.68 [95\% CI 0.53, 0.88]) after adjusting for confounders and average weekly alcohol amount.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that alcohol drinking frequency is associated with risk of diabetes and that consumption of alcohol over 3-4 days per week is associated with the lowest risk of diabetes, even after taking average weekly alcohol consumption into account.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The present study constitutes the first randomized controlled trial to investigate the relation of lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) to brain function using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It was hypothesized that L and Z supplementation in older adults would enhance neural efficiency (i.e., reduce activation) and cognitive performance on a verbal learning task relative to placebo.
METHODS: A total of 44 community-dwelling older adults (mean age=72 years) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or L+Z supplementation (12 mg/daily) for 1 year. Neurocognitive performance was assessed at baseline and post-intervention on an fMRI-adapted task involving learning and recalling word pairs. Imaging contrasts of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal were created by subtracting active control trials from learning and recall trials. A flexible factorial model was employed to investigate the expected group (placebo vs. supplement) by time (baseline vs. post-intervention) interaction in pre-specified regions-of-interest.
RESULTS: L and Z appeared to buffer cognitive decline on the verbal learning task (Cohen's d=.84). Significant interactions during learning were observed in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (p {\textless} .05, family-wise-error corrected). However, these effects were in the direction of increased rather than decreased BOLD signal. Although the omnibus interaction was not significant during recall, within-group contrasts revealed significant increases in left prefrontal activation in the supplement group only.
CONCLUSIONS: L and Z supplementation appears to benefit neurocognitive function by enhancing cerebral perfusion, even if consumed for a discrete period of time in late life. (JINS, 2018, 24, 77-90).},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-associated degenerative disease of the midbrain that results from the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. It initially presents as a movement disorder with cognitive and other behavioral problems appearing later in the progression of the disease. Current therapies for PD only delay the onset or reduce the motor symptoms. There are no treatments to stop the nerve cell death or to cure the disease. It is becoming increasingly clear that neurological diseases such as PD are multi-factorial involving disruptions in multiple cellular systems. Thus, it is unlikely that modulating only a single factor will be effective at either preventing disease development or slowing disease progression. A better approach is to identify small molecules that have multiple biological activities relevant to the maintenance of brain function. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that are widely distributed in fruits and vegetables and therefore regularly consumed in the human diet. While flavonoids were historically characterized on the basis of their antioxidant and free radical scavenging effects, more recent studies have shown that flavonoids have a wide range of activities that could make them particularly effective as agents for the treatment of PD. In this article, the multiple physiological benefits of flavonoids in the context of PD are first reviewed. Then, the evidence for the beneficial effects of the flavonol fisetin in models of PD are discussed. These results, coupled with the known actions of fisetin, suggest that it could reduce the impact of PD on brain function.},

	abstract = {Obesity, which is caused by an energy imbalance between calorie intake and consumption, has become a major international health burden. Obesity increases the risk of insulin resistance and age-related cognitive decline, accompanied by peripheral inflammation. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in green tea, possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective activities; however, few reports have focused on its potential effect on cognitive disorders. In this study, our goal was to investigate the protective effects of EGCG treatment on insulin resistance and memory impairment induced by a high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD). We randomly assigned 3-mo-old C57BL/6J mice to 3 groups with different diets: control group, HFFD group, and HFFD plus EGCG group. Memory loss was assessed by using the Morris water maze test, during which EGCG was observed to prevent HFFD-elicited memory impairment and neuronal loss. Consistent with these results, EGCG attenuated HFFD-induced neuronal damage. Of note, EGCG significantly ameliorated insulin resistance and cognitive disorder by up-regulating the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)/AKT and ERK/cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathways. Long-term HFFD-triggered neuroinflammation was restored by EGCG supplementation by inhibiting the MAPK and NF-κB pathways, as well as the expression of inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α. EGCG also reversed high glucose and glucosamine-induced insulin resistance in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells by improving the oxidized cellular status and mitochondrial function. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide compelling evidence that the nutritional compound EGCG has the potential to ameliorate HFFD-triggered learning and memory loss.-Mi, Y., Qi, G., Fan, R., Qiao, Q., Sun, Y., Gao, Y., Liu, X.

	doi = {10.3389/fnagi.2017.00183},
	abstract = {One apparent consequence of aging appears to be loss of some aspects of cognitive control. This loss is measurable as early as mid-adulthood. Since, like many aspects of cognition, there is wide variance among individuals, it is possible that behavior, such as one's diet, could drive some of these differences. For instance, past data on older humans and non-human primates have suggested that dietary carotenoids could slow cognitive decline. In this study, we tested how early such protection might manifest by examining a sample (n = 60) of 25-45 year olds. Carotenoid status was assessed by directly measuring macular pigment optical density (MPOD) which has shown to be highly correlated with the primary carotenoid in brain, lutein. Cognitive control was measured using event-related potentials during the performance of cognitive control tasks designed to tap into different aspects of attentional (i.e., selective attention, attentional inhibition, and response inhibition) control. Our results showed that, across participants, MPOD was related to both age and the P3 component of participants' neuroelectric profile (P3 amplitude) for attentional, but not response, inhibition. Although younger adults exhibited larger P3 amplitudes than their older adult counterparts, older subjects with higher MPOD levels displayed P3 indices similar to their younger adult counterparts in amplitude. Furthermore, hierarchical regression analyses showed that age was no longer a significant predictor of P3 amplitude when MPOD was included as a predictor in the model, suggesting that MPOD may partially contribute to the relationship between age and P3 amplitude. In addition, age and MPOD were shown to have independent associations with intraindividual variability of attentional control, such that younger individuals and individuals with higher MPOD showed less intraindividual variability. These results show a relationship between retinal carotenoids and neuroelectric indices underlying cognitive control. The protective role of carotenoids within the CNS may be evident during early and middle adulthood, decades prior to the onset of older age.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remains as the main cause of mortality. Observational studies supports an association between intake of tomato products or lycopene with a reduced CVDs risk. Our aim was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence on the topic.
METHODS: Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from inception until July 2017. We included longitudinal and cross-sectional studies reporting associations between lycopene and tomato consumption and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among adult subjects. Random-effects models were used to determine the pooled effect sizes.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight publications met our inclusion criteria and 25 studies provided quantitative data for meta-analysis. Results showed that individuals in the highest consumption category of, or with the highest serum concentration of, lycopene had significantly lower risk of stroke (hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 0.62-0.89, p = 0.02; I2 = 32) and CVDs (HR 0.86, 0.77-0.95, p = 0.003; I2 = 0). In addition, individuals categorised in the highest serum concentration of lycopene also had significantly lower risk of mortality (HR 0.63, 0.49-0.81, p{\textless}0.001; I2 = 46). Lycopene was not significantly associated with myocardial infarction, while scarce evidence on the association of lycopene with atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure, or atrial fibrillation was evident. Evidence from three studies suggested that higher intakes of tomato were associated with non-significantly lower stroke, CVDs and CHD.
CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive meta-analysis suggests that high-intakes or high-serum concentration of lycopene are associated with significant reductions in the risk of stroke (26\%), mortality (37\%) and CVDs (14\%).},

	abstract = {Circulating trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a canonical metabolite from gut flora, has been related to the risk of cardiovascular disorders. However, the association between circulating TMAO and the risk of cardiovascular events has not been quantitatively evaluated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all available cohort studies regarding the association between baseline circulating TMAO and subsequent cardiovascular events. Embase and PubMed databases were searched for relevant cohort studies. The overall hazard ratios for the developing of cardiovascular events (CVEs) and mortality were extracted. Heterogeneity among the included studies was evaluated with Cochran's Q Test and I2 statistics. A random-effect model or a fixed-effect model was applied depending on the heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to evaluate the source of heterogeneity. Among the 11 eligible studies, three reported both CVE and mortality outcome, one reported only CVEs and the other seven provided mortality data only. Higher circulating TMAO was associated with a 23\% higher risk of CVEs (HR = 1.23, 95\% CI: 1.07-1.42, I2 = 31.4\%) and a 55\% higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.55, 95\% CI: 1.19-2.02, I2 = 80.8\%). Notably, the latter association may be blunted by potential publication bias, although sensitivity analysis by omitting one study at a time did not significantly change the results. Further subgroup analysis and meta-regression did not support that the location of the study, follow-up duration, publication year, population characteristics or the samples of TMAO affect the results significantly. Higher circulating TMAO may independently predict the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events and mortality.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00125-017-4305-4},
	abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Overeating of dietary fats causes obesity in humans and rodents. Recent studies in humans and rodents have demonstrated that addiction to fats shares a common mechanism with addiction to alcohol, nicotine and narcotics in terms of a dysfunction of brain reward systems. It has been highlighted that a high-fat diet (HFD) attenuates dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) signalling in the striatum, a pivotal regulator of the brain reward system, resulting in hedonic overeating. We previously reported that the brown rice-specific bioactive constituent γ-oryzanol attenuated the preference for an HFD via hypothalamic control. We therefore explored the possibility that γ-oryzanol would modulate functioning of the brain reward system in mice.
METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice fed an HFD were orally treated with γ-oryzanol, and striatal levels of molecules involved in D2R signalling were evaluated. The impact of γ-oryzanol on DNA methylation of the D2R promoter and subsequent changes in preferences for dietary fat was examined. In addition, the effects of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), on food preference, D2R signalling and the levels of DNMTs in the striatum were investigated. The inhibitory effects of γ-oryzanol on the activity of DNMTs were enzymatically evaluated in vitro.
RESULTS: In striatum from mice fed an HFD, the production of D2Rs was decreased via an increase in DNA methylation of the promoter region of the D2R. Oral administration of γ-oryzanol decreased the expression and activity of DNMTs, thereby restoring the level of D2Rs in the striatum. Pharmacological inhibition of DNMTs by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine also ameliorated the preference for dietary fat. Consistent with these findings, enzymatic in vitro assays demonstrated that γ-oryzanol inhibited the activity of DNMTs.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We demonstrated that γ-oryzanol ameliorates HFD-induced DNA hypermethylation of the promoter region of D2R in the striatum of mice. Our experimental paradigm highlights γ-oryzanol as a promising antiobesity substance with the distinct property of being a novel epigenetic modulator.},

	abstract = {Astaxanthin is a carotenoid with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of astaxanthin on skin deterioration, we confirmed its role in epidermal-dermal interactions in vitro. Astaxanthin treatment suppressed ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced inflammatory cytokine secretion in keratinocytes, and matrix metalloproteinase-1 secretion by fibroblasts cultured in UVB-irradiated keratinocyte medium. To verify these findings, we conducted a 16-week clinical study with 65 healthy female participants. Participants were orally administered either a 6 mg or 12 mg dose of astaxanthin or a placebo. Wrinkle parameters and skin moisture content significantly worsened in the placebo group after 16 weeks. However, significant changes did not occur in the astaxanthin groups. Interleukin-1α levels in the stratum corneum significantly increased in the placebo and low-dose groups but not in the high-dose group between weeks 0 and 16. This study was performed in Japan from August to December, when changing environmental factors, such as UV and dryness, exacerbate skin deterioration. In conclusion, our study suggests that long-term prophylactic astaxanthin supplementation may inhibit age-related skin deterioration and maintain skin conditions associated with environmentally induced damage via its anti-inflammatory effect.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Diets of lower energy density are associated with higher diet quality, lower body weights, and better health outcomes. This study examined associations among dietary energy density, energy-adjusted diet costs, and socioeconomic indicators of study participants.
DESIGN: In this cross-sectional study, energy and nutrient intakes for 164 men and women aged 25 to 65 years were obtained using a food frequency instrument between June 2005 and September 2006. Dietary energy density (kcal/g) was calculated with and without beverages. Energy-adjusted diet costs (\$/2,000 kcal) were calculated using food prices in Seattle, WA. Tertile splits of energy density and energy cost were analyzed using tests for linear trend. Linear regression models tested the association between education, income, and dietary variables, adjusting for age and sex.
RESULTS: Diets of lower energy density were associated with higher absolute nutrient intakes. Diets of lower energy density were also associated with higher energy-adjusted diet costs. Conversely, highest energy density diets were associated with lower intakes of micronutrients and fiber and lower costs. Education and household income showed a negative association with dietary energy density in regression models. Education and household incomes showed a positive association with the energy-adjusted cost of the diet. Education was a stronger predictor of both energy density and energy cost than was household income.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher-quality diets were not only more costly per kilocalorie but were also consumed by persons of higher educational level. The influence of diet quality on health, observed in some epidemiologic studies, might be modulated by unobserved indexes of socioeconomic status.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Vitamin B3 has been shown to play an important role during embryogenesis. Specifically, there is growing evidence that nicotinamide, the biologically active form of vitamin B3, plays a critical role as a morphogen in the differentiation of stem cells to mature cell phenotypes, including those of the central nervous system (CNS). Detailed knowledge of the action of small molecules during neuronal differentiation is not only critical for uncovering mechanisms underlying lineage-specification, but also to establish more effective differentiation protocols to obtain clinically relevant cells for regenerative therapies for neurodegenerative conditions such as Huntington's disease (HD). Thus, this study aimed to investigate the potential of nicotinamide to promote the conversion of stem cells to mature CNS neurons.
METHODS: Nicotinamide was applied to differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC; Sox1GFP knock-in 46C cell line) during their conversion towards a neural fate. Cells were assessed for changes in their proliferation, differentiation and maturation; using immunocytochemistry and morphometric analysis methods.
RESULTS: Results presented indicate that 10 mM nicotinamide, when added at the initial stages of differentiation, promoted accelerated progression of ESCs to a neural lineage in adherent monolayer cultures. By 14 days in vitro (DIV), early exposure to nicotinamide was shown to increase the numbers of differentiated βIII-tubulin-positive neurons. Nicotinamide decreased the proportion of pluripotent stem cells, concomitantly increasing numbers of neural progenitors at 4 DIV. These progenitors then underwent rapid conversion to neurons, observed by a reduction in Sox 1 expression and decreased numbers of neural progenitors in the cultures at 14 DIV. Furthermore, GABAergic neurons generated in the presence of nicotinamide showed increased maturity and complexity of neurites at 14 DIV. Therefore, addition of nicotinamide alone caused an accelerated passage of pluripotent cells through lineage specification and further to non-dividing mature neurons.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that, within an optimal dose range, nicotinamide is able to singly and selectively direct the conversion of embryonic stem cells to mature neurons, and therefore may be a critical factor for normal brain development, thus supporting previous evidence of the fundamental role of vitamins and their metabolites during early CNS development. In addition, nicotinamide may offer a simple effective supplement to enhance the conversion of stem cells to clinically relevant neurons.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies showed a strong association between alcoholism and incidence of stroke, for which the underlying causative mechanisms remain to be understood. Here we found that infiltration of immune cells and deposition of cholesterol at the site of brain artery/capillary injury induced atherosclerosis in chronic alcohol (ethanol) consumption in the presence or absence of high-fat diet. Conversion of cholesterol into sharp edges of cholesterol crystals (CCs) in alcohol intake was key to activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, induction of cerebral atherosclerosis, and development of neuropathy around the atherosclerotic lesions. The presence of alcohol was critical for the formation of CCs and development of the neuropathology. Thus, we observed that alcohol consumption elevated the level of plasma cholesterol, deposition and crystallization of cholesterol, as well as activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. This led to arteriole or capillary walls thickening and increase intracranial blood pressure. Distinct neuropathy around the atherosclerotic lesions indicated vascular inflammation as an initial cause of neuronal degeneration. We demonstrated the molecular mechanisms of NLRP3 activation and downstream signaling cascade event in primary culture of human brain arterial/capillary endothelial cells in the setting of dose-/time-dependent effects of alcohol/CCs using NLRP3 gene silencing technique. We also detected CCs in blood samples from alcohol users, which validated the clinical importance of the findings. Finally, combined therapy of acetyl-l-carnitine and LipitorÂ® prevented deposition of cholesterol, formation of CCs, activation of NLRP3, thickening of vessel walls, and elevation of intracranial blood pressure. We conclude that alcohol-induced accumulation and crystallization of cholesterol activates NLRP3/caspase-1 in the cerebral vessel that leads to early development of atherosclerosis.},

	abstract = {Background: Cashews are the third most-consumed tree nut in the United States and are abundant with monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk. Although a qualified Food and Drug Administration health claim exists for nuts and heart health, cashews have been exempt from its use because cashews exceed the disqualifying amount of saturated fatty acids. Approximately one-third of the saturated fat in cashews is stearic acid, which is relatively neutral on blood lipids, thereby suggesting that cashews could have effects that are similar to those of other nuts. However, clinical data on cashews and blood lipids have been limited.Objective: We investigated the effect of reasonable intakes of cashews on serum lipids in adults with or at risk of high LDL cholesterol.Design: In a randomized, crossover, isocaloric, controlled-feeding study, 51 men and women (aged 21-73 y) with a median LDL-cholesterol concentration of 159 mg/dL (95\% CI: 146, 165 mg/dL) at screening consumed typical American diets with cashews (28-64 g/d; 50\% of kilocalories from carbohydrate, 18\% of kilocalories from protein, and 32\% of kilocalories from total fat) or potato chips (control; 54\% of kilocalories from carbohydrate, 18\% of kilocalories from protein, and 29\% of kilocalories from total fat) for 28 d with a â‰¥2-wk washout period.Results: Consumption of the cashew diet resulted in a significantly greater median change from baseline (compared with the control, all P {\textless} 0.05) in total cholesterol [-3.9\% (95\% CI: -9.3\%, 1.7\%) compared with 0.8\% (95\% CI: -1.5\%, 4.5\%), respectively], LDL cholesterol [-4.8\% (95\% CI: -12.6\%, 3.1\%) compared with 1.2\% (95\% CI: -2.3\%, 7.8\%), respectively], non-HDL cholesterol [-5.3\% (95\% CI: -8.6\%, 2.1\%) compared with 1.7\% (95\% CI: -0.9\%, 5.6\%), respectively], and the total-cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio [-0.0\% (95\% CI: -4.3\%, 4.8\%) compared with 3.4\% (95\% CI: 0.6\%, 5.2\%), respectively]. There were no significant differences between diets for HDL cholesterol and triglyceride.Conclusions: In comparison with a control diet, the incorporation of cashews into typical American diets decreases total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Results from this study provide support that the daily consumption of cashews, when substituted for a high-carbohydrate snack, may be a simple dietary strategy to help manage total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.

Aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) and intrinsic mechanical stiffness, two measures of arterial stiffness, were assessed in C57BL/6 mice that were young (6months), old (27-29months), or old treated with hesperidin for 4weeks. Old compared with young mice had increased aPWV (444±10 vs. 358±8cm/s, P{\textless}0.05) and mechanical stiffness (6506±369 vs. 3664±414kPa, P{\textless}0.05). In old mice hesperidin reduced both aPWV (331±38cm/s) and mechanical stiffness (4445±667kPa) to levels not different from young. Aortic segments from old animals cultured with (+) PVAT had greater mechanical stiffness compared to young (+) PVAT (6454±323 vs. 3575±440kPa, P{\textless}0.05) that was ameliorated in arteries from old hesperidin treated cultured (+) PVAT (2639±258kPa). Hesperidin also reversed the aging-related PVAT AGE accumulation (all, P{\textless}0.05). A 4-week treatment with the AGE inhibitor aminoguanidine reversed both the age-related increase in aPWV (390±7cm/s) and mechanical stiffness (3396±1072kPa), as well as mechanical stiffness in arteries cultured (+) PVAT (3292±716kPa) (all, P{\textless}0.05) to values not different from young.

Data on glycemic parameters, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHDG), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were collected at the baseline and at the end of the study. In hesperidin group, TAC increased (0.74 ± 0.16 vs. 0.82 ± 0.18), while serum froctoseamin (5.79 ± 5.86 vs. 5.01 ± 4.95; p = 0.001), 8-OHDG (14.32 ± 6.4 vs. 11.00 ± 7.0; p = 0.000), and MDA (5.78 ± 1.76 vs. 4.60 ± 0.75; p = 0.000) decreased in comparison with the baseline values. There was a significant difference in percent change of TAC (13.35 ± 19.21 vs. 3.13 ± 10.02; p = 0.043), froctoseamin (-10.10 ± 16.84 vs. 4.27 ± 34.646), 8-OHDG (-25.11 ± 28.23 vs. 8.69 ± 35.41; p = 0.000), and MDA (-16.46 ± 18.04 vs. -1.82 ± 22.63; p = 0.007) between hesperidin and control groups following intervention in adjusted models.

However, controversy exists regarding to the safety of carrageenan and accumulating evidence indicates that it could induce colitis in experimental models. Here, to provide more information on this issue and solve the debate, we studied and compared in detail the toxic effects of different isomers of carrageenan (κ-, ι-, and λ-) on the colon of C57BL/6J mice. Interestingly, all isomers of carrageenan were found to induce colitis with a comparable activity. Given that carrageenan is unabsorbed after oral administration, and also in light of the fact that gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of colitis, we further investigated the effect of carrageenan on gut microbiota using high-throughput sequencing. Intriguingly, carrageenan-induced colitis was observed to be robustly correlated with changes in the composition of gut microbiota. Specifically, all carrageenans significantly decreased the abundance of a potent anti-inflammatory bacterium, Akkermansia muciniphila, in the gut, which is highly relevant for understanding the toxic effect of carrageenan. Altogether, our results corroborate previous studies demonstrating harmful gastrointestinal effect of carrageenan and, from a gut microbiota perspective, shed new light into the mechanism by which carrageenan induces colitis in experimental animals.},

We conducted a meta-analysis with a dose-response analysis to quantitatively summarize the evidence about the association between coffee and caffeine intakes and risk of depression.
METHOD: Relevant articles were identified by researching PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WANFANG DATA in English or Chinese from 1 January 1980 to 1 May 2015. Case-control, cohort or cross-sectional studies evaluating coffee or caffeine consumption and depression were included. A random-effects model was used to combine study-specific relative risk and 95\% confidence interval. Dose-response relationship was assessed by restricted cubic spline functions.
RESULTS: Data were obtained from 11 observation articles; 330,677 participants from seven studies in seven articles were included in the coffee-depression analysis, while 38,223 participants from eight studies in seven articles were involved in the caffeine-depression analysis. Compared with the lowest level consumption, the pooled relative risk (95\% confidence interval) for coffee-depression and caffeine-depression was 0.757 [0.624, 0.917] and 0.721 [0.522, 0.997], respectively. For dose-response analysis, evidence of a linear association was found between coffee consumption and depression, and the risk of depression decreased by 8\% (relative risk = 0.92, 95\% confidence interval = [0.87, 0.97], p = 0.002) for each cup/day increment in coffee intake; a nonlinear association was found between caffeine consumption and depression, the risk of depression decreased faster and the association became significant when the caffeine consumption was above 68 mg/day and below 509 mg/day.
CONCLUSIONS: Coffee and caffeine consumption were significantly associated with decreased risk of depression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Spirulina is a known a functional food related to lipid profiles, immune functions, and antioxidant capacity. Circulating monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) level is associated with inflammation markers. Single nucleotide polymorphism in the MCP-1 promoter region -2518 have been identified and shown to affect gene transcription. Gene variation may also impact functional food supplementary effects. The current study investigated the interaction of MCP-1 -2518 polymorphism with spirulina supplements on anti-inflammatory capacity in Korean elderly.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: After genotyping, healthy elderly subjects (n = 78) were included in a randomized, double blind, and placebo controlled study. Baseline characteristic, body composition, and dietary intake were measured twice (baseline vs. week 16). For 16 weeks, subjects consumed 8 g either spirulina or placebo daily. Plasma MCP-1, interleukin (IL) -2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, complement (C) 3, immunoglobulin (Ig) G, and Ig A concentrations and lymphocyte proliferation rate (LPR) were analyzed as inflammatory markers.
RESULTS: In the placebo group with A/A genotype, MCP-1 level was significantly increased, but the spirulina group with A/A genotype was unchanged. IL-2 was significantly increased only in subjects with spirulina supplementation. TNF-α was significantly reduced in subjects with the G carrier. C3 was significantly increased in the placebo group, particularly when A/A increased more than G, but not when spirulina was ingested. LPR was significantly different only in subjects with A/A genotype; there was a significant increase in phytohemagglutinin and lipopolysaccharide induced LPR in the spirulina group.
CONCLUSION: In healthy Korean elderly, spirulina supplementation may influence different inflammatory markers by the MCP-1 genotype. These results may be useful for customized dietary guidelines to improve immune function in Koreans.},

Certain interrelated articles were also considered. In summary, olive oil appears to preserve semen quality in in vivo systems. This result seems to be applicable in humans, but requires additional confirmation in clinical trials. Meanwhile adding olive oil to seminal fluid in vitro seems not to be favorable to sperm parameters. The mechanisms by which olive oil preserves semen quality are through enhancing gonadal function, reducing the level of oxidative injury and lipid peroxidation, and improving nitric oxide signaling.},

	abstract = {Nicotinamide and catecholamines are both degraded by S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation. Whether excess nicotinamide affects the degradation of catecholamines is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of nicotinamide on the methylation status of the body and methylation-mediated catecholamine degradation in both normotensives and hypertensives. The study was conducted in 19 normotensives and 27 hypertensives, using a nicotinamide-loading test (100 mg orally). Plasma nicotinamide, N(1)-methylnicotinamide, homocysteine (Hcy), betaine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, normetanephrine and metanephrine levels before and 5 h after nicotinamide loading were measured. Compared with normotensives, hypertensives had higher baseline (fasting) levels of plasma nicotinamide, Hcy and norepinephrine, but lower levels of plasma normetanephrine, a methylated norepinephrine derivative. Nicotinamide loading induced a significant increase in the levels of plasma N(1)-methylnicotinamide and norepinephrine, and a significant decrease in the levels of O-methylated epinephrine (metanephrine) and betaine, a major methyl donor, in both hypertensives and normotensives. Moreover, nicotinamide-loading significantly increased plasma Hcy levels, but decreased plasma normetanephrine levels in normotensives. The baseline levels of plasma epinephrine in hypertensives were similar to those of normotensives, but the post-nicotinamide-loading levels of plasma epinephrine in hypertensives were higher than those of normotensives. This study demonstrated that excess nicotinamide might deplete the labile methyl pool, increase Hcy generation and inhibit catecholamine degradation. It also revealed that hypertensives had an abnormal methylation pattern, characterized by elevated fasting plasma levels of unmethylated substrates, nicotinamide, Hcy and norepinephrine. Therefore, it seems likely that high nicotinamide intake may be involved in the pathogenesis of Hcy-related cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {Methylation, a methyl group-consuming reaction, plays a key role in the degradation (i.e., inactivation) of monoamine neurotransmitters, including catecholamines, serotonin and histamine. Without labile methyl groups, the methylation-mediated degradation cannot take place. Although high niacin (nicotinic acid and nicotinamide) intake, which is very common nowadays, is known to deplete the body's methyl-group pool, its effect on monoamine-neurotransmitter degradation is not well understood. The aim of this article was to investigate the effect of excess nicotinamide on the levels of plasma serotonin and histamine in healthy subjects. Urine and venous blood samples were collected from nine healthy male volunteers before and after oral loading with 100 mg nicotinamide. Plasma N(1)-methylnicotinamide, urinary N(1)-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2-Py), and plasma betaine levels were measured by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Plasma concentrations of choline, serotonin and histamine were measured using commercial kits. The results showed that the plasma N(1)-methylnicotinamide level and the urinary excretion of 2-Py significantly increased after oral loading with 100 mg nicotinamide, which was accompanied with a decrease in the methyl-group donor betaine. Compared with those before nicotinamide load, five-hour postload plasma serotonin and histamine levels significantly increased. These results suggest that excess nicotinamide can disturb monoamine-neurotransmitter metabolism. These findings may be of significance in understanding the etiology of monoamine-related mental diseases, such as schizophrenia and autism (a neurodevelopmental disorder).},

	doi = {10.1097/FJC.0000000000000197},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Food or supplement-derived L-carnitine is changed to trimethylamine (TMA) by interstinal microbiota, which is further metabolized to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), being involved in the promotion of atherosclerosis in animal models. Meanwhile, carnitine deficiency has played a role in accelerated atherosclerosis in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, effects of oral L-carnitine supplementation on circulating levels of TMAO and markers of vascular injury and oxidative stress in patients on HD remain unclear. In this study, we addressed the issue.
METHODS: Thirty-one HD patients with carnitine deficiency were treated with oral L-carnitine (900 mg/d) for 6 months. At baseline and after treatment, clinical variables including circulating levels of carnitine fractions, TMA, TMAO, advanced glycation end products (AGE), soluble forms of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured.
RESULTS: Oral L-carnitine supplementation significantly increased total, free, acyl carnitine, and plasma TMA and TMAO levels, whereas it decreased markers of vascular injury and oxidative stress such as sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, and MDA levels. TMA and TMAO levels at baseline were correlated with each other, and free carnitine was independently associated with TMAO levels. Furthermore, change in AGE values from baseline ([INCREMENT]AGE) was positively correlated with [INCREMENT]sICAM-1 (P = 0.043) and was a sole independent determinant of [INCREMENT]sICAM-1 (R = 0.133, P = 0.043).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that although oral L-carnitine supplementation was associated with increased TMAO levels, it might be beneficial on vascular injury in patients on HD. Vasculoprotective properties of L-carnitine supplementation in HD patients might be ascribed partly to its inhibitory actions on AGE.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: TMAO concentrations of 297 healthy individuals were assessed using 1 H-NMR spectroscopy for 24 h urine collection and spot urine, and LC-MS for plasma. Of 35 assessed food groups, those with a correlation of ρ {\textgreater}{\textbar}0.15{\textbar} with plasma or urine TMAO levels were further investigated in multivariate linear regression models showing current fish and (red) meat consumption as plausible dietary sources of TMAO. Overall, explained variance of TMAO levels by current diet and co-variables (age, sex, lean body mass, glomerular filtration rate) was small. Associations with urine and plasma concentrations differed depending on the TMAO source. Fish consumption was associated with urine and plasma TMAO concentrations, whereas meat consumption was only associated with TMAO concentrations in plasma. Furthermore, associations of plasma TMAO concentration with fish consumption were two times stronger than with meat consumption.
CONCLUSION: Meat and fish consumption differentially affects TMAO concentrations in body fluids. Only a small fraction of variance is explained by current diet.},

Because of the high prevalence of supplemental vitamin B use, any possible increased association warrants further investigation. We examined the association between long-term use of supplemental B vitamins on the one-carbon metabolism pathway and lung cancer risk in the Vitamins and Lifestyle (VITAL) cohort, which was designed specifically to look at supplement use relative to cancer risk. Methods A total of 77,118 participants of the VITAL cohort, 50 to 76 years of age, were recruited between October 2000 and December 2002 and included in this analysis. Incident, primary, invasive lung cancers (n = 808) were ascertained by prospectively linking the participants to a population-based cancer registry. The 10-year average daily dose from individual and multivitamin supplements were the exposures of primary interest. Results Use of supplemental vitamins B6, folate, and B12 was not associated with lung cancer risk among women. In contrast, use of vitamin B6 and B12 from individual supplement sources, but not from multivitamins, was associated with a 30\% to 40\% increase in lung cancer risk among men. When the 10-year average supplement dose was evaluated, there was an almost two-fold increase in lung cancer risk among men in the highest categories of vitamin B6 ({\textgreater} 20 mg/d; hazard ratio, 1.82; 95\% CI, 1.25 to 2.65) and B12 ({\textgreater} 55Âµg/d; hazard ratio, 1.98; 95\% CI, 1.32 to 2.97) compared with nonusers. For vitamin B6 and B12, the risk was even higher among men who were smoking at baseline. In addition, the B6 and B12 associations were apparent in all histologic types except adenocarcinoma, which is the type less related to smoking. Conclusion This sex- and source-specific association provides further evidence that vitamin B supplements are not chemopreventive for lung cancer and may be harmful.},

Detailed assessment of all possible sources of glycine shows that synthesis from serine accounts for more than 85\% of the total, and that the amount of glycine available from synthesis, about 3 g/day, together with that available from the diet, in the range 1.5-3.0 g/day, may fall significantly short of the amount needed for all metabolic uses, including collagen synthesis by about 10 g per day for a 70 kg human. This result supports earlier suggestions in the literature that glycine is a semi-essential amino acid and that it should be taken as a nutritional supplement to guarantee a healthy metabolism.},

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not supplementation with L+Z could improve cognitive function in community-dwelling, older adults. Design: Double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 62 older adults were randomized into groups receiving either 12 mg L+Z or a visually identical placebo. Data from 51 participants (M = 73.7 years) were available for analysis. Retinal L+Z levels (macular pigment optical density, MPOD) were measured psychophysically using heterochromatic flicker photometry as a biomarker of cortical L+Z levels. Cognitive function was measured using the CNS Vital Signs computerized test platform. Results: Participants receiving the active L+Z supplement had statistically significant increases in MPOD (p {\textless} 0.03) and improvements in complex attention (p {\textless} 0.02) and cognitive flexibility domains (p {\textless} 0.04), relative to participants taking the placebo. A trend was also seen for the executive function domain (p = 0.073). In male participants only, supplementation yielded improved composite memory (p = 0.04). Conclusions: Supplementation with L+Z improved cognitive function in community-dwelling, older men and women.},

	doi = {10.3945/ajcn.110.003483},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aging is associated with oxidative stress, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: We tested whether glutathione deficiency occurs because of diminished synthesis and contributes to oxidative stress in aging and whether stimulating glutathione synthesis with its precursors cysteine and glycine could alleviate oxidative stress.
DESIGN: Eight elderly and 8 younger subjects received stable-isotope infusions of [2H(2)]glycine, after which red blood cell (RBC) glutathione synthesis and concentrations, plasma oxidative stress, and markers of oxidant damage (eg, F(2)-isoprostanes) were measured. Elderly subjects were restudied after 2 wk of glutathione precursor supplementation.
RESULTS: Compared with younger control subjects, elderly subjects had markedly lower RBC concentrations of glycine (486.7 ± 28.3 compared with 218.0 ± 23.7 μmol/L; P {\textless} 0.01), cysteine (26.2 ± 1.4 compared with 19.8 ± 1.3 μmol/L; P {\textless} 0.05), and glutathione (2.08 ± 0.12 compared with 1.12 ± 0.18 mmol/L RBCs; P {\textless} 0.05); lower glutathione fractional (83.14 ± 6.43\% compared with 45.80 ± 5.69\%/d; P {\textless} 0.01) and absolute (1.73 ± 0.16 compared with 0.55 ± 0.12 mmol/L RBCs per day; P {\textless} 0.01) synthesis rates; and higher plasma oxidative stress (304 ± 16 compared with 346 ± 20 Carratelli units; P {\textless} 0.05) and plasma F(2)-isoprostanes (97.7 ± 8.3 compared with 136.3 ± 11.3 pg/mL; P {\textless} 0.05). Precursor supplementation in elderly subjects led to a 94.6\% higher glutathione concentration, a 78.8\% higher fractional synthesis rate, a 230.9\% higher absolute synthesis rate, and significantly lower plasma oxidative stress and F(2)-isoprostanes. No differences in these measures were observed between younger subjects and supplemented elderly subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Glutathione deficiency in elderly humans occurs because of a marked reduction in synthesis. Dietary supplementation with the glutathione precursors cysteine and glycine fully restores glutathione synthesis and concentrations and lowers levels of oxidative stress and oxidant damages. These findings suggest a practical and effective approach to decreasing oxidative stress in aging.},

	abstract = {We examined whether escalating doses of potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) supplements alter urinary nitrogen excretion expressed as a ratio to same day nitrogen intake (measure of muscle-protein breakdown). The ratio declined significantly from placebo to low to high dose of KHCO3 supplementation in older adults over 3 months, suggesting muscle-sparing.
INTRODUCTION: Neutralization of dietary acid load with alkali supplementation (i.e., KHCO3) has been hypothesized to have muscle protein-sparing effects. In controlled feeding studies with fixed nitrogen (N) intake/day, 24-h urinary N excretion is a good marker of muscle breakdown. However, in studies with self-selected diets, changes in 24-h urinary N excretion can be influenced by shifts in N intake.
METHODS: We evaluated changes in 24-h total urinary N excretion as a ratio of N excretion to concurrent N intake in 233 older men and women who participated in an 84-day KHCO3 supplementation randomized placebo-controlled trial.
RESULTS: After adjustment for relevant cofactors, escalating doses of KHCO3 (1 mmol/kg/day [low] or 1.5 mmol/kg/day [high]) resulted in a progressive decline in urinary N excretion/N intake compared to placebo (overall P for trend = 0.042). The 84-day change in urinary N excretion/N intake in the high-dose KHCO3 group was statistically significantly lower compared to placebo (P = 0.012) but not compared to the low-dose KHCO3 group (P = 0.276). The 84-day change in urinary N excretion/N intake in the low-dose KHCO3 group did not differ significantly from placebo (P = 0.145).
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary N excretion expressed as ratio to same day N intake declined steadily with increasing doses of KHCO3 supplementation from low 1 mmol/kg/day to high 1.5 mmol/kg/day, suggesting a nitrogen-sparing effect. Compared to urinary N excretion alone, this ratio could be a more reasonable measure of muscle protein metabolism in large-scale long-term human studies.

Saccharin, sucralose, aspartame and acesulfame-K are the most commonly used sweeteners. In the present study, the abovementioned artificial sweeteners were used to assess their glycating properties by established methods such as browning, fructosamine assay, determination of carbonyl content, protein aggregation, and measurement of fluorescence. Amadori and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed as a result of the interaction between carbonyl groups of reducing sugars and amino groups of proteins and other macromolecules during glycation. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of artificial sweeteners on the formation of AGEs and protein oxidation in an in vitro model of glucose-mediated protein glycation. The results indicated that the abovementioned artificial sweeteners do not enhance the process of glycation. On the other hand, acesulfame-K was found to have antiglycating potential as it caused decreased formation of Amadori products and AGEs. Further studies are essential in the characterization of Amadori products and AGEs produced as a result of interaction between sweeteners and proteins, which are interfered with by sweeteners. This study is significant in understanding the probable role of artificial sweeteners in the process of glycation and the subsequent effect on macromolecular alteration.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coffee, one of the world's most consumed beverages, has many benefits. Some studies have reported the effects of coffee on aging. The aim of this study was to investigate the locomotor activity, energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism of aged (20-mo-old) mice given coffee.
METHODS: Aged C57 BL/6 NCr mice were divided into three groups: controls that were not given coffee (n = 9), a group that received 0.1\% caffeinated coffee (n = 9), and a group that received 0.1\% decaffeinated coffee (n = 9). This regimen continued for 17 wk until mice reached the age of 24 mo.
RESULTS: Regular and decaffeinated coffee consumption decreased plasma-free fatty acid levels, increased hepatic adenosine triphosphate content, and decreased total mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR) protein content in the liver. However, no differences were found in the protein or activity levels of Akt, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), p70 S6 kinase, or sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, proteins that are upstream or downstream of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-related pathways. Regular coffee consumption increased food and water intake, locomotor activity, the volume of carbon dioxide production, and the respiration exchange ratio.
CONCLUSION: Regular and decaffeinated coffee consumption decreased hepatic total mTOR and p-mTOR levels independently of Akt and AMPK pathways in aged mice. Because decreased mTORC1 activity is known to have antiaging effects, coffee consumption during old age may retard aging. Moreover, coffee consumption by the aged population had a positive effect on behavioral energy and lipid metabolism.},

Coffee is a rich source of phenolic compounds including the phenolic acid, chlorogenic acid (CGA). The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of coffee as a whole beverage on endothelial function, blood pressure and blood glucose concentration. Twelve healthy men and women were recruited to a randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, with three treatments tested: (i) 18 g of ground caffeinated coffee containing 300 mg CGA in 200 mL of hot water, (ii) 18 g of decaffeinated coffee containing 287 mg CGA in 200 mL of hot water, and (iii) 200 mL of hot water (control). Treatment beverages were consumed twice, two hours apart, with the second beverage consumed simultaneously with a 75 g glucose load. Blood pressure was recorded and the finger prick glucose test was performed at time = 0 and then every 30 minutes up to 2 hours. Endothelial function, assessed using flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, was measured at 1 hour and a blood sample taken at 2 hours to measure plasma nitrate/nitrite and 5-CGA concentrations. The FMD response was significantly higher in the caffeinated coffee group compared to both decaffeinated coffee and water groups (P {\textless} 0.001). There was no significant difference in the FMD response between decaffeinated coffee and water. Blood glucose concentrations and blood pressure were not different between the three treatment groups. In conclusion, the consumption of caffeinated coffee resulted in a significant improvement in endothelial function, but there was no evidence for benefit regarding glucose metabolism or blood pressure. Although the mechanism has yet to be elucidated the results suggest that coffee as a whole beverage may improve endothelial function, or that caffeine is the component of coffee responsible for improving FMD.},

However, the effects of long-term treatment of humans with DHA and EPA on various epigenetic factors-such as DNA methylation, which controls messenger RNA generation-are poorly described.Objective: We wanted to determine the effects of 6 mo of dietary supplementation with an n-3 FA preparation rich in DHA on global DNA methylation of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and the relation to plasma EPA and DHA concentrations in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients.Design: In the present study, DNA methylation in four 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites of long interspersed nuclear element-1 repetitive sequences was assessed in a group of 63 patients (30 given the n-3 FA preparation and 33 given placebo) as an estimation of the global DNA methylation in blood cells. Patients originated from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled OmegAD study, in which 174 AD patients received either 1.7 g DHA and 0.6 g EPA (the n-3 FA group) or placebo daily for 6 mo.Results: At 6 mo, the n-3 FA group displayed marked increases in DHA and EPA plasma concentrations (2.6- and 3.5-fold), as well as decreased methylation in 2 out of 4 CpG sites (P {\textless} 0.05 for all), respectively. This hypomethylation in CpG2 and CpG4 sites showed a reverse correlation to changes in plasma EPA concentration (r = -0.25, P = 0.045; and r = -0.26, P = 0.041, respectively), but not to changes in plasma DHA concentration, and were not related to apolipoprotein E-4 allele frequency.Conclusion: Supplementation with n-3 FA for 6 mo was associated with global DNA hypomethylation in PBLs. Our data may be of importance in measuring various effects of marine oils, including gene expression, in patients with AD and in other patients taking n-3 FA supplements.

	abstract = {Background: Dietary fat composition can affect ectopic lipid accumulation and, thereby, insulin resistance. Diets that are high in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have different metabolic responses.Objective: We investigated whether the epigenome of human adipose tissue is affected differently by dietary fat composition and general overfeeding in a randomized trial.Design: We studied the effects of 7 wk of excessive SFA (n = 17) or PUFA (n = 14) intake (+750 kcal/d) on the DNA methylation of ∼450,000 sites in human subcutaneous adipose tissue. Both diets resulted in similar body weight increases. We also combined the data from the 2 groups to examine the overall effect of overfeeding on the DNA methylation in adipose tissue.Results: The DNA methylation of 4875 Cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites was affected differently between the 2 diets. Furthermore, both the SFA and PUFA diets increased the mean degree of DNA methylation in adipose tissue, particularly in promoter regions. However, although the mean methylation was changed in 1797 genes [e.g., alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase (FTO), interleukin 6 (IL6), insulin receptor (INSR), neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1), and proopiomelanocortin (POMC)] by PUFAs, only 125 genes [e.g., adiponectin, C1Q and collagen domain containing (ADIPOQ)] were changed by SFA overfeeding. In addition, the SFA diet significantly altered the expression of 28 transcripts [e.g., acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) and FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1)], whereas the PUFA diet did not significantly affect gene expression. When the data from the 2 diet groups were combined, the mean methylation of 1444 genes, including fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1), fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2), melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R), MC3R, PPARG coactivator 1 α (PPARGC1A), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), was changed in adipose tissue by overfeeding. Moreover, the baseline DNA methylation of 12 CpG sites that was annotated to 9 genes [e.g., mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 (MAPK7), melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1), and splicing factor SWAP homolog (SFRS8)] was associated with the degree of weight increase in response to extra energy intake.Conclusions: SFA overfeeding and PUFA overfeeding induce distinct epigenetic changes in human adipose tissue. In addition, we present data that suggest that baseline DNA methylation can predict weight increase in response to overfeeding in humans.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enzymatically modified isoquercitrin (EMIQ) is produced from rutin using enzymatic hydrolysis followed by treatment with glycosyltransferase in the presence of dextrin to add glucose residues. EMIQ is absorbed in the same way as quercetin, a powerful antioxidant reported to prevent disused muscle atrophy by targeting mitochondria and to have ergogenic effects. The present study investigated the effect of EMIQ on skeletal muscle hypertrophy induced by functional overload.
METHODS: In Study 1, 6-week-old ICR male mice were divided into 4 groups: sham-operated control, sham-operated EMIQ, overload-operated control, and overload-operated EMIQ groups. In Study 2, mice were divided into 3 groups: overload-operated whey control, overload-operated whey/EMIQ (low dose), and overload-operated whey/EMIQ (high dose) groups. The functional overload of the plantaris muscle was induced by ablation of the synergist (gastrocnemius and soleus) muscles. EMIQ and whey protein were administered with food. Three weeks after the operation, the cross-sectional area and minimal fiber diameter of the plantaris muscle fibers were measured.
RESULTS: In Study 1, functional overload increased the cross-sectional area and minimal fiber diameter of the plantaris muscle. EMIQ supplementation significantly increased the cross-sectional area and minimal fiber diameter of the plantaris muscle in both the sham-operated and overload-operated groups. In Study 2, EMIQ supplementation combined with whey protein administration significantly increased the cross-sectional area and minimal fiber diameter of the plantaris muscle.
CONCLUSION: EMIQ, even when administered as an addition to whey protein supplementation, significantly intensified the fiber hypertrophy of the plantaris muscle in functionally overloaded mice. EMIQ supplementation also induced fiber hypertrophy of the plantaris in sham-operated mice.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial, we investigated whether oral sodium nitrate, when added to existing background medication, reduces exertional ischemia in patients with angina.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy patients with stable angina, positive electrocardiogram treadmill test, and either angiographic or functional test evidence of significant ischemic heart disease were randomized to receive oral treatment with either placebo or sodium nitrate (600 mg; 7 mmol) for 7 to 10 days, followed by a 2-week washout period before crossing over to the other treatment (n=34 placebo-nitrate, n=36 nitrate-placebo). At baseline and at the end of each treatment, patients underwent modified Bruce electrocardiogram treadmill test, modified Seattle Questionnaire, and subgroups were investigated with dobutamine stress, echocardiogram, and blood tests. The primary outcome was time to 1 mm ST depression on electrocardiogram treadmill test. Compared with placebo, inorganic nitrate treatment tended to increase the primary outcome exercise time to 1 mm ST segment depression (645.6 [603.1, 688.0] seconds versus 661.2 [6183, 704.0] seconds, P=0.10) and significantly increased total exercise time (744.4 [702.4, 786.4] seconds versus 760.9 [719.5, 802.2] seconds, P=0.04; mean [95\% confidence interval]). Nitrate treatment robustly increased plasma nitrate (18.3 [15.2, 21.5] versus 297.6 [218.4, 376.8] μmol/L, P{\textless}0.0001) and almost doubled circulating nitrite concentrations (346 [285, 405] versus 552 [398, 706] nmol/L, P=0.003; placebo versus nitrate treatment). Other secondary outcomes were not significantly altered by the intervention. Patients on antacid medication appeared to benefit less from nitrate supplementation.
CONCLUSIONS: Sodium nitrate treatment may confer a modest exercise capacity benefit in patients with chronic angina who are taking other background medication.

Skeletal muscle combines multiple signals that contribute to the beneficial effects of exercise on cardiometabolic health. Inorganic nitrate increases exercise efficiency, tolerance, and performance. The transcriptional regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α) coordinates the exercise-stimulated skeletal muscle fiber-type switch from glycolytic fast-twitch (type IIb) to oxidative slow-twitch (type I) and intermediate (type IIa) fibers, an effect reversed in insulin resistance and diabetes. We found that nitrate induces PGC1α expression and a switch toward type I and IIa fibers in rat muscle and myotubes in vitro. Nitrate induces the release of exercise/PGC1α-dependent myokine FNDC5/irisin and β-aminoisobutyric acid from myotubes and muscle in rats and humans. Both exercise and nitrate stimulated PGC1α-mediated γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) secretion from muscle. Circulating GABA concentrations were increased in exercising mice and nitrate-treated rats and humans; thus, GABA may function as an exercise/PGC1α-mediated myokine-like small molecule. Moreover, nitrate increased circulating growth hormone levels in humans and rodents. Nitrate induces physiological responses that mimic exercise training and may underlie the beneficial effects of this metabolite on exercise and cardiometabolic health.},

When over-activated, microglia release pro-inflammatory factors, such as nitric oxide (NO) and cytokines, which are critical in eliciting neuroinflammatory responses associated with neurodegenerative diseases. This study examined whether bromelain, the pineapple-derived extract, may exert an anti-inflammatory effect in primary microglia and may be neuroprotective by regulating microglial activation.
METHODS: Following the isolation of neonatal rat primary microglial cells, the activation profile of microglia was investigated by studying the effects of bromelain (5, 10, 20, and 30 µg/ml) on the levels of NO, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in microglia treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 µg/ml). Data were analyzed using Student's t-test. P values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant, compared with the LPS-treated group without bromelain.
RESULTS: Results showed that pretreatment of rat primary microglia with bromelain, decreased the production of NO induced by LPS (1 µg/ml) treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Bromelain (30 µg/ml) also significantly reduced the expression of iNOS at mRNA level and NF-κB at protein level. Moreover, the study of mitochondrial activity in microglia indicated that bromelain had no cytotoxicity at any of the applied doses, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effects of bromelain are not due to cell death.
CONCLUSION: Bromelain can be of potential use as an agent for alleviation of symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {Microalgal food supplements are becoming increasingly popular due to their promising biological effects and high nutritional value, evidenced in in vitro, in vivo, and human studies. Some products of this kind have, however, raised controversies concerning their safety. At the same time, not much is known about the frequency of adverse events following the use of microalgal supplements, potential factors that may influence them, and general characteristics and behaviours of the consumer group. The present study aimed to fill this gap and surveyed a group of Polish consumers of microalgal products (n = 150) using an online questionnaire. As found, microalgal supplements (Spirulina, Chlorella, and Aphanizomenon) were popular in groups representing lacto-ovo-vegetarianism and veganism and were consumed predominantly for nutritional, immune-boosting, and detoxifying purposes. Their use was rarely discussed with specialists; the Internet constituted the most important source of information regarding these supplements. The most frequently self-reported health-beneficial effects of supplementation included the following: increased immunity, higher vitality, improved hair and skin quality, and better general well-being. Diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, and skin rash were among the most often reported adverse events. Pre-existing medical conditions, namely renal failure and hypothyroidism, but not Hashimoto's thyroiditis, were associated with increased occurrence of side effects. Those individuals who had consulted specialists as to the use of supplements reported adverse events significantly less often. A strikingly high frequency of side effects and very low consumer satisfaction were reported by a group of consumers supplementing Aphanizomenon-based products. In summary, the present study highlights that microalgal consumers may benefit from additional warnings of potential side effects and from consulting a qualified health specialist prior to use.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a single blind, randomized, two-arm crossover controlled study. Human subjects ingested a WBB beverage (25 g freeze dried WBB powder) or placebo beverage with a meal and plasma was collected over 24 h. Anthocyanins, CGA and their metabolites were characterized and quantified in beverages and in plasma using targeted and non-targeted mass analyses. Bioavailability of WBB anthocyanins and 3-CGA was 1.1 and 0.2\%, respectively. Parent anthocyanins and 3-CGA peaked ≈2 h post ingestion, while phase II metabolites, including glucuronide conjugates of peonidin, delphinidin, cyanidin and petunidin peaked ≈ 2.6, 6.3, 7 and 8.8 h, respectively. Phenolic acids (metabolites) peaked between 0.5 and 24 h. Biphasic responses were evident suggesting preferential enterohepatic recycling for some compounds.
CONCLUSION: The data indicate bioavailability of early and late phase WBB metabolites peaking at different times during the 24 h period, which may be important for maximizing their biological activity.},

In this study, we examined the effect of ALA and its gut lactic acid bacteria metabolites 13-hydroxy-9(Z),15(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (13-OH) and 13-oxo-9(Z),15(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (13-oxo) on the differentiation of M2 macrophages from bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) and investigated the underlying mechanisms. BMDCs were stimulated with ALA, 13-OH, or 13-oxo in the presence of IL-4 or IL-13 for 24 h, and significant increases in M2 macrophage markers CD206 and Arginase-1 (Arg1) were observed. In addition, M2 macrophage phenotypes were less prevalent following cotreatment with GPCR40 antagonists or inhibitors of PLC-β and MEK under these conditions, suggesting that GPCR40 signaling is involved in the regulation of M2 macrophage differentiation. In further experiments, remarkable M2 macrophage accumulation was observed in the lamina propria of the small intestine of C57BL/6 mice after intragastric treatments with ALA, 13-OH, or 13-oxo at 1 g/kg of body weight per day for 3 d.

This randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial determined the effect in healthy volunteers of two gastroresistant capsules containing 15 mg/day of HT, for a 3-week period (HTT). Evaluation of nutritional status, serum metabolites, oxidative stress biomarkers, and gene expression of 9 genes related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and CVDs was performed. Oxidation biomarkers like thiol group (p = 0.001), total antioxidant status (TAS) (p = 0.001), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) (2-ΔΔCt = 3.7), and plasma concentration of HT (2.83 μg·mL-1) were significantly increased, while nitrite (p = 0.001), nitrate (p = 0.001), and malondialdehyde (MDA) (p = 0.02) were drastically reduced after HTT. A significant reduction of body fat mass percentage (p = 0.01), suprailiac skinfold (p = 0.01), and weight (p = 0.04; Δ\% = -0.46\%) was observed after HTT. This study shows that regular intake of 15 mg/day of HT changed body composition parameters and modulated the antioxidant profile and the expression of inflammation and oxidative stress-related genes.

Excitotoxicity occurs in multiple neurologic disorders and NAD+ was shown to prevent neuronal degeneration in this process through mechanisms that remained to be determined. The activity of nicotinamide riboside (NR) in neuroprotective models and the recent description of extracellular conversion of NAD+ to NR prompted us to probe the effects of NAD+ and NR in protection against excitotoxicity. Here, we show that intracortical administration of NR but not NAD+ reduces brain damage induced by NMDA injection. Using cortical neurons, we found that provision of extracellular NR delays NMDA-induced axonal degeneration (AxD) much more strongly than extracellular NAD+ Moreover, the stronger effect of NR compared to NAD+ depends of axonal stress since in AxD induced by pharmacological inhibition of nicotinamide salvage, both NAD+ and NR prevent neuronal death and AxD in a manner that depends on internalization of NR. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that NR is a better neuroprotective agent than NAD+ in excitotoxicity-induced AxD and that axonal protection involves defending intracellular NAD+ homeostasis.-Vaur, P., Brugg, B., Mericskay, M., Li, Z., Schmidt, M.

Methods 45 normotensive subjects (aged 29 to 65 years) were enrolled from a rural community of Northern China at random. All of the participants were maintained on a low-salt (3 g/day) diet for 7 days, a high-salt (18 g/day) diet for 7 days, and then a high-salt diet with potassium supplementation (4.5 g/day, KCl) for another 7 days.

Results Participants exhibited increased plasma insulin level, as well as progressed HOMA-IR, during a high-salt diet intervention, which potassium supplementation reversed. Moreover, after salt loading, the plasma IL-17A concentrations increased significantly (4.2±2.1 pg/mL to 9.7±5.1 pg/mL; P{\textless}0.01), whereas dropped considerably when dietary potassium was supplemented (9.7±5.1 pg/mL to 2.0±0.9 pg/mL; P{\textless}0.001).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: d-Allulose, a C-3 epimer of d-fructose, has been reported to decrease body weight and adipose tissue weight in animal studies and is expected to be a potent antiobese sweetener. Our animal study suggested that one of the mechanisms of d-allulose's antiobesity function is an increase in energy expenditure. However, a few studies have thus far explored the underlying mechanism in humans. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a single ingestion of d-allulose on postprandial energy metabolism in healthy participants.
METHODS: Thirteen healthy men and women (mean age of 35.7 ± 2.1 y and body mass index 20.9 ± 0.7 kg/m2) were studied. The study was a randomized, single-blind crossover design with a 1-wk washout period. At 30 min after taking 5 g of d-allulose or 10 mg of aspartame without any sugar as a control, overnight-fasted participants ingested a standardized meal, and energy metabolism was evaluated by a breath-by-breath method. During the experiment, blood was collected and biochemical parameters such as plasma glucose were analyzed.
RESULTS: In the d-allulose-treated group, the area under the curve of fat oxidation was significantly higher than in the control group (10.5 ± 0.4 versus 9.6 ± 0.3 kJ·4 h·kg-1 body weight [BW]; P {\textless} 0.05), whereas that of carbohydrate oxidation was significantly lower (8.1 ± 0.5 versus 9.2 ± 0.5 kJ·4 h·kg-1 BW; P {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, plasma glucose levels were significantly lower, and free fatty acid levels were significantly higher in the d-allulose group than in the control group. No other parameters such as insulin, total cholesterol, or triacylglycerol were modified.
CONCLUSION: d-Allulose enhances postprandial fat oxidation in healthy humans, indicating that it could be a novel sweetener to control and maintain healthy body weight, probably through enhanced energy metabolism.},

It has also been shown that ingestion of beet root juice (BRJ) increases blood flow to the brain and enhances exercise performance. Here, we examined whether there are synergistic effects of BRJ and exercise on neuroplasticity in the aging brain.
Methods: Peak metabolic equivalent (MET) capacity and resting-state magnetic resonance imaging functional brain network organization are reported on 26 older (mean age = 65.4 years) participants randomly assigned to 6 weeks of exercise + BRJ or exercise + placebo.
Results: Somatomotor community structure consistency was significantly enhanced in the exercise + BRJ group following the intervention (MBRJ = -2.27, SE = 0.145, MPlacebo = -2.89, SE = 0.156, p = .007). Differences in second-order connections between the somatomotor cortex and insular cortex were also significant; the exercise + BRJ group (M = 3.28, SE = 0.167) had a significantly lower number of connections than exercise + placebo (M = 3.91, SE = 0.18, p = .017) following the intervention. Evaluation of peak MET capacity revealed a trend for the exercise + BRJ group to have higher MET capacity following the intervention.
Conclusions: Older adults who exercised and consumed BRJ demonstrated greater consistency within the motor community and fewer secondary connections with the insular cortex compared with those who exercised without BRJ. The exercise + BRJ group had brain networks that more closely resembled those of younger adults, showing the potential enhanced neuroplasticity conferred by combining exercise and BRJ consumption.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of replacing standard wheat flour (SWF) with resistant wheat starch (RWS) on markers of appetite and food intake in healthy adults.
METHODS: A randomized, single-blind, crossover study was conducted with 27 healthy adults (ages 23 ± 2 y with a body mass index of 23.0 ± 3.0 kg/m2). After an overnight fast, muffins that contained only SWF or muffins in which 40\% of the SWF was replaced with RWS were consumed as part of the breakfast meal. Appetite questionnaires and plasma samples were collected before the test meal and at 10 time points after meal consumption. An ad libitum meal was provided 240 min after breakfast, and the amount eaten was recorded. Food intake was recorded over the remainder of the day using a diet diary, and appetite was measured hourly using appetite questionnaires. Plasma was assayed to measure biomarkers of satiety and glycemia.
RESULTS: Replacing SWF with RWS had no effect on subjective appetite or energy intake at the lunch meal (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Total daily energy intake (including the breakfast meal) was reduced by 179 kcal when participants consumed the RWS muffins (P = 0.05). Replacing SWF with RWS reduced plasma insulin (P {\textless} 0.05) but had no effect on plasma glucose, cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide-1, or peptide YY3-36 concentration (P {\textgreater} 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that replacing SWF with RWS decreases plasma insulin concentration and reduces energy intake over a 24-h period.},

Our objective was to determine the effects of oral lignan supplementation on biochemical and functional indicators of inflammation as well as safety and tolerability in older healthy adults. We designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in older healthy adults (60-80 years) to assess flaxseed lignan-enriched complex (∼38\% secoisolariciresinol diglucoside [SDG]; 600 mg SDG dose) oral supplementation effects on biochemical and functional indicators of inflammation and safety and tolerability in older healthy adults after 6 months of once-daily oral administration. The clinical trial confirmed that plasma concentration of total flaxseed lignans (free and conjugated forms) secoisolariciresinol (SECO), enterodiol (ED), and enterolactone (ENL) were significantly associated with daily oral supplementation of flaxseed lignan-enriched complex (p {\textless} 0.05). A significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP; from a mean of 155 ± 13 mm Hg at baseline to 140 ± 11 mm Hg at 24 weeks) was observed in lignan-supplemented participants stratified into an SBP ≥140 mm Hg subcategory (p = 0.04). No differences were found between treatment or placebo groups in terms of cognition, pain, activity, physical measurements (calf, waist, and upper arm circumstances), and grip strength. With respect to blood inflammatory markers, lipid profiles, and biochemical parameters, no significant differences were found between treatment and placebo groups at the end of the 6-month supplementation. No adverse effects were reported during supplementation. These data further support the safety and tolerability of long-term flaxseed lignan-enriched complex supplementation in older adults and identify an ability to favorably modulate SBP, an important risk factor in cardiovascular disease.},

METHODS: Healthy, under and well-nourished men were studied before and after 8 wk, during which low (n=20) and high (n=20) lysine diets were consumed. The low lysine diets (∼25 and ∼40 mgkg(-1)d(-1) for under and well-nourished respectively) were based on the subjects' habitual lysine intake, while the high lysine diet supplied 80 mgkg(-1)d(-1). Anthropometry, muscle function, insulin sensitivity (IS) and leucine kinetics were measured before and after the experimental period.
RESULTS: The high lysine diet had a small positive effect (about +7.5\%) on muscle strength, but no effect on other parameters. Over the 8 wk period in the whole group, the change in muscle strength correlated with the change in muscle mass (r=0.5, P=0.001), while the change in muscle mass correlated with the change in IS (r=0.3, P=0.04), but there were no intake specific differences.
CONCLUSION: Over an 8 wk controlled feeding period, an intake of 80 mg lysine kg(-1)d(-1) had a small positive effect on muscle strength, but no other effects.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have anticolorectal cancer (CRC) activity. The intestinal microbiota has been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. Dietary omega-3 PUFAs alter the mouse intestinal microbiome compatible with antineoplastic activity. Therefore, we investigated the effect of omega-3 PUFA supplements on the faecal microbiome in middle-aged, healthy volunteers (n=22).
DESIGN: A randomised, open-label, cross-over trial of 8 weeks' treatment with 4 g mixed eicosapentaenoic acid/docosahexaenoic acid in two formulations (soft-gel capsules and Smartfish drinks), separated by a 12-week 'washout' period. Faecal samples were collected at five time-points for microbiome analysis by 16S ribosomal RNA PCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid analysis was performed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Both omega-3 PUFA formulations induced similar changes in RBC fatty acid content, except that drinks were associated with a larger, and more prolonged, decrease in omega-6 PUFA arachidonic acid than the capsule intervention (p=0.02). There were no significant changes in α or β diversity, or phyla composition, associated with omega-3 PUFA supplementation. However, a reversible increased abundance of several genera, including Bifidobacterium, Roseburia and Lactobacillus was observed with one or both omega-3 PUFA interventions. Microbiome changes did not correlate with RBC omega-3 PUFA incorporation or development of omega-3 PUFA-induced diarrhoea. There were no treatment order effects.
CONCLUSION: Omega-3 PUFA supplementation induces a reversible increase in several short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, independently of the method of administration. There is no simple relationship between the intestinal microbiome and systemic omega-3 PUFA exposure.

However, it is still unclear how gut microbiota in middle-aged populations responds to dietary fats at a normal dose. In this study, we explored gut microbiota structure in middle-aged rats (aged 12 months) after feeding 4\% (w/w) soybean oil, lard or fish oil for 3 months, respectively. The results showed that the gut microbiota structure in the fish oil group was substantially different from those of the soybean oil and lard groups in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The relative abundances of phylum Proteobacteria and genus Desulfovibrio in the caecal and colonic contents were the highest in the fish oil group (p {\textless} 0.05). The mRNA levels of biomarkers for inflammation in the colon, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, IL-18 and TNF-α, were also the highest in the fish oil group (p {\textless} 0.05). Meanwhile, the fish oil group had the highest microbial DNA abundance of a predicted lipid metabolism. Our results gave a new insight into the potentially negative impact of fish oil diet on health of middle-aged populations by changing gut microbiota and inducing inflammation as compared to soybean oil and lard diets.},

However, biomarkers of inflammation that reflect the early stage metabolic derangements are not optimally sensitive. Lipid challenges elicit postprandial inflammatory and metabolic responses. Gender-specific transcriptomic networks of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were constructed in response to a lipid challenge.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-six adult males and females of comparable age, anthropometric, and biochemical profiles completed an oral lipid tolerance test (OLTT). PBMC transcriptome was profiled following OLTT. Weighted gene coexpression networks were constructed separately for males and females. Functional ontology analysis of network modules was performed and hub genes identified. Two modules of interest were identified in females-an "inflammatory" module and an "energy metabolism" module. NLRP3, which plays a central role in inflammation and STARD3 that is involved in cholesterol metabolism, were identified as hub genes for the respective modules.
CONCLUSION: The OLTT induced some gender-specific correlations of gene coexpression network modules. In females, biological processes relating to energy metabolism and inflammation pathways were evident. This suggests a gender specific link between inflammation and energy metabolism in response to lipids. In contrast, G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway was common to both genders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Vitamin K status has been linked to fat and glucose metabolism by several authors, but whether high vitamin K intake influences body weight or composition has remained unclear. Here we tested the hypothesis that increased vitamin K intake decreases body fat or fat distribution.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: In a randomized placebo-controlled human intervention trial, 214 postmenopausal women, 55-65 years of age, received either 180â€‰mcg/day of vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7, MK-7) or placebo for 3 years. Osteocalcin (OC) carboxylation was used as a marker for vitamin K status, and fat distribution was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry total body scan.
RESULTS: In the total cohort, MK-7 supplementation increased circulating carboxylated OC (cOC) but had no effect on body composition. In those with an above-median response in OC carboxylation ('good responders'), MK-7 treatment resulted in a significant increase in total and human molecular weight adiponectin and a decrease in abdominal fat mass and in the estimated visceral adipose tissue area compared with the placebo group and the poor responders.
CONCLUSIONS: The fact that changes in body composition measures or markers for fat or glucose metabolism were not associated with changes in uncarboxylated OC (ucOC) does not support the assumption that ucOC stimulates fat metabolism in humans. Instead, high vitamin K2 intake may support reducing body weight, abdominal and visceral fat, notably in subjects showing a strong increase in cOC. A causal relation between the changes in cOC and body fat or distribution cannot be concluded from these data.},

	abstract = {Aging is associated with increased peripheral chemoreceptor activity, reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, and attenuation of cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), collectively increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Evidence suggests that NO may attenuate peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity and increase BRS. Exogenous inorganic nitrate ([Formula: see text]) increases NO bioavailability via the [Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text]-NO pathway. Our hypothesis was that inorganic [Formula: see text] supplementation would attenuate peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity and enhance spontaneous cardiovagal BRS in older adults. We used a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design in which 13 older (67 ± 3 yr old) adults ingested beetroot powder containing (BRA) or devoid of (BRP) [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] daily over 4 wk. Spontaneous cardiovagal BRS was assessed over 15 min of rest and was quantified using the sequence method. Chemoreflex sensitivity was assessed via {\textasciitilde}5 min of hypoxia (10\% fraction of inspired O2) and reported as the slope of the relationship between O2 saturation (\%[Formula: see text]) and minute ventilation (in l/min) or heart rate (in beats/min). Ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia was reduced after BRA (from -0.14 ± 0.04 to -0.05 ± 0.02 l·min-1·\%[Formula: see text]-1, P = 0.01) versus BRP (from -0.10 ± 0.05 to -0.11 ± 0.05 l·min-1·\%[Formula: see text]-1, P = 0.80), with no differences in heart rate responsiveness (BRA: from -0.47 ± 0.06 to -0.33 ± 0.04 beats·min-1·\%[Formula: see text]-1, BRP: from -0.48 ± 0.07 to -0.42 ± 0.06 beats·min-1·\%[Formula: see text]-1) between conditions (interaction effect, P = 0.41). Spontaneous cardiovagal BRS was unchanged after BRA and BRP (interaction effects, P = 0.69, 0.94, and 0.39 for all, up, and down sequences, respectively), despite a reduction in resting systolic and mean arterial blood pressure in the experimental (BRA) group ( P {\textless} 0.01 for both). These findings illustrate that inorganic [Formula: see text] supplementation attenuates peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity without concomitant change in spontaneous cardiovagal BRS in older adults.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Berry fruits rich in anthocyanins have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Blood phagocytes are an important source of oxidants that contribute to inflammatory response and oxidative stress. We examined the effect of sour cherry consumption on luminol-enhanced whole blood chemiluminescence (LBCL) reflecting oxidants generation by circulating phagocytes in healthy subjects.
METHODS: Thirty-four and 29 healthy subjects (on a regular diet) consumed 500 g of sour cherries containing 346.5 mg of total anthocyanins or 500 g of anthocyanin-free apples everyday (between 1100 and 1400 hours) for 30 days. Twenty-four volunteers without any dietary intervention served as the control with respect to LBCL changes over the study period. Fasting blood and spot morning urine samples were collected before and after the fruit courses and after the 10-day wash-out period to measure resting and agonist (fMLP)-induced LBCL, blood cell count, concentration of various phenolics, and plasma antioxidant activity.
RESULTS: Sour cherries inhibited (p {\textless} 0.05) median resting LBCL (by 29.5\% and 33.7\%) and fMLP-LBCL (by 24.7\% and 32.3\%) after 30-day consumption and after 10-day wash-out, respectively. No changes in LBCL were noted in the apple consumers and controls. Increased urinary levels of chlorogenic, 4-hydroxyhippuric, and 3-hydroxyhippuric acids occasionally correlated negatively with resting and fMLP-LBCL in sour cherry consumers. Other measured variables did not change in all groups over the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of resting and agonist-induced LBCL suggests that regular sour cherry consumption may suppress the formation of reactive oxygen species by circulating phagocytes and decrease the risk of systemic imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants. This may be attributed to the anthocyanins in sour cherry and be one of mechanisms of the health-promoting effects of consumption of anthocyanin-rich fruits.},

Clinical studies support the vascular benefits of blueberry anthocyanins, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. The hypothesis that metabolites of blueberry anthocyanins attenuate lipotoxicity-induced endothelial dysfunction was tested.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were treated for 6 h with either: (i) the parent anthocyanins (malvidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside); or (ii) the blueberry metabolites (hydroxyhippuric acid, hippuric acid, benzoic acid-4-sulfate, isovanillic acid-3-sulfate, and vanillic acid-4-sulfate), at concentrations known to circulate in humans following blueberry consumption. For the last 5 h HAECs were treated with palmitate or vehicle. HAECs treated with palmitate displayed elevated reactive oxygen species generation, increased mRNA expression of NOX4, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and IκBα, exaggerated monocyte binding, and suppressed nitric oxide production. Of note, the damaging effects of palmitate were ameliorated in HAECs treated with blueberry metabolites but not parent anthocyanins. Further, important translational relevance of these results was provided by our observation that palmitate-induced endothelial dysfunction was lessened in arterial segments that incubated concurrently with blueberry metabolites.
CONCLUSION: The presented findings indicate that the vascular benefits of blueberry anthocyanins are mediated by their metabolites. Blueberries might complement existing therapies to lessen vascular complications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chemopreventive effects and the underlying mechanisms of blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) are not clearly understood in human. We hypothesized blueberry would work via antioxidative and epigenetic modulation, which is similar to vitamin C.
METHODS: We performed a pilot and non-inferiority study in healthy young women (n = 12), who consumed vitamin C (1 g/d) or 240 mL of blueberry juice (total polyphenols 300 mg and proanthocyanidin 76 mg/d) for 2 weeks. We analyzed 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in their urine, and global and specific DNA methylation at the NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), or DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) genes in their blood.
RESULTS: Urinary 8-OHdG levels were reduced by blueberry consumption rather than by vitamin C. The methylation (\%) of the MTHFR was significantly decreased in blueberry-consumers and the antioxidant-susceptible subgroup, whose urinary MDA levels were decreased by the intervention. We also found a positive correlation between changes of urinary 8-OHdG and of DNA methylation at the MTHFR or the DNMT1 (P {\textless} 0.05). However, the genetic polymorphism of the MTHFR (C677T in exon 4) did not affect any above markers.
CONCLUSIONS: Blueberry juice shows similar anti-oxidative or anti-premutagenic activity to vitamin C and the potential as a methylation inhibitor for the MTHFR and the DNMT1 in human.},

Here we show that supraphysiological levels of D-mannose safely achievable by drinking-water supplementation suppressed immunopathology in mouse models of autoimmune diabetes and airway inflammation, and increased the proportion of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in mice. In vitro, D-mannose stimulated Treg cell differentiation in human and mouse cells by promoting TGF-β activation, which in turn was mediated by upregulation of integrin αvβ8 and reactive oxygen species generated by increased fatty acid oxidation. This previously unrecognized immunoregulatory function of D-mannose may have clinical applications for immunopathology.},

	abstract = {The cognitive benefits of acute flavonoid interventions have been well documented, however, research to date has found that, depending on developmental stage, these benefits manifest themselves in different cognitive domains. It is argued that the lack of global cognitive effects following flavonoid intervention may be a result of insufficient task sensitivity for those domains where no benefits are found. In children, executive function is a cognitive domain which has shown little apparent benefit following flavonoid intervention. Here, we describe a Modified Attention Network Task (MANT) designed to vary levels of cognitive demand across trials in order to investigate whether flavonoid related benefits can be shown for executive function when task sensitivity is carefully manipulated. Twenty-one children were recruited to a double blind cross-over study consuming 30 g freeze dried blueberry powder (WBB) or placebo before being tested at 3 hours. Performance in the WBB condition was found to be significantly faster in comparison to placebo particularly on more cognitively demanding incongruent and high load trials. Trials in which a visual cue alerted participants to the imminent appearance of the target also showed better performance following WBB administration. We conclude that WBB administration can enhance executive function during demanding elements of a task, but that the complexity and demand of the task as a whole may be equally important to performance.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Lutein, a carotenoid with anti-oxidant functions, preferentially accumulates in primate brain and is positively related to cognition in humans. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), is also beneficial for cognition, but is susceptible to oxidation. The present study characterized the membrane distribution of lutein in brain regions important for different domains of cognitive function and determined whether membrane lutein was associated with brain PUFA oxidation.
METHODS: Adult rhesus monkeys were fed a stock diet ({\textasciitilde}2 mg/day lutein or {\textasciitilde}0.5 μmol/kg body weight/day) (n = 9) or the stock diet plus a daily supplement of lutein ({\textasciitilde}4.5 mg/day or{\textasciitilde}1 μmol/kg body weight/day) and zeaxanthin ({\textasciitilde}0.5 mg/day or 0.1 μmol/kg body weight/day) for 6-12 months (n = 4). Nuclear, myelin, mitochondrial, and neuronal plasma membranes were isolated using a Ficoll density gradient from prefrontal cortex (PFC), cerebellum (CER), striatum (ST), and hippocampus (HC). Carotenoids, PUFAs, and PUFA oxidation products were measured using HPLC, GC, and LC-GC/MS, respectively.
RESULTS: All-trans-lutein (ng/mg protein) was detected in all regions and membranes and was highly variable among monkeys. Lutein/zeaxanthin supplementation significantly increased total concentrations of lutein in serum, PFC and CER, as well as lutein in mitochondrial membranes and total DHA concentrations in PFC only (P{\textless}0.05). In PFC and ST, mitochondrial lutein was inversely related to DHA oxidation products, but not those from arachidonic acid (P {\textless}0.05).
DISCUSSION: This study provides novel data on subcellular lutein accumulation and its relationship to DHA oxidation in primate brain. These findings support the hypothesis that lutein may be associated with antioxidant functions in the brain.},

In recent years, several nutraceuticals, including curcumin, by virtue of their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, have received considerable attention as potential treatments for age-related cognitive decline and inflammation. Accordingly, we assessed for the first time in a non-human primate model of normal aging the efficacy of dietary intervention using the natural phenol curcumin to ameliorate the effects of aging on spatial working and recognition memory. Results revealed that monkeys receiving daily administration of curcumin over 14-18Â months demonstrated a greater improvement in performance on repeated administration of a task of spatial working memory compared to monkeys that received a control substance.},

	abstract = {Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema, is one of the most common chronic skin conditions worldwide, affecting up to 16\% of children and 10\% of adults. It is incurable and has significant psychosocial and economic impacts on the affected individuals. AD etiology has been linked to deficiencies in the skin barrier protein, filaggrin. In mammalian skin, l-histidine is rapidly incorporated into filaggrin. Subsequent filaggrin proteolysis releases l-histidine as an important natural moisturizing factor (NMF). In vitro studies were conducted to investigate the influence of l-histidine on filaggrin processing and barrier function in human skin-equivalent models. Our further aim was to examine the effects of daily oral l-histidine supplementation on disease severity in adult AD patients. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, nutritional supplementation pilot study to explore the effects of oral l-histidine in adult AD patients (n=24). In vitro studies demonstrated that l-histidine significantly increased both filaggrin formation and skin barrier function (P{\textless}0.01, respectively). Data from the clinical study indicated that once daily oral l-histidine significantly reduced (P{\textless}0.003) AD disease severity by 34\% (physician assessment using the SCORingAD tool) and 39\% (patient self-assessment using the Patient Oriented Eczema Measure tool) after 4 weeks of treatment. No improvement was noted with the placebo (P{\textgreater}0.32). The clinical effect of oral l-histidine in AD was similar to that of mid-potency topical corticosteroids and combined with its safety profile suggests that it may be a safe, nonsteroidal approach suitable for long-term use in skin conditions that are associated with filaggrin deficits such as AD.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the dose-response effects of acute glutamine supplementation on markers of gastrointestinal (GI) permeability, damage and, secondary, subjective symptoms of GI discomfort in response to running in the heat.
METHODS: Ten recreationally active males completed a total of four exercise trials; a placebo trial and three glutamine trials at 0.25, 0.5 and 0.9 g kg-1 of fat-free mass (FFM) consumed 2 h before exercise. Each exercise trial consisted of a 60-min treadmill run at 70\% of [Formula: see text] in an environmental chamber set at 30 °C. GI permeability was measured using ratio of lactulose to rhamnose (L:R) in serum. Plasma glutamine and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) concentrations were determined pre and post exercise. Subjective GI symptoms were assessed 45 min and 24 h post-exercise.
RESULTS: Relative to placebo, L:R was likely lower following 0.25 g kg-1 (mean difference: - 0.023; ± 0.021) and 0.5 g kg-1 (- 0.019; ± 0.019) and very likely following 0.9 g kg- 1 (- 0.034; ± 0.024). GI symptoms were typically low and there was no effect of supplementation.
DISCUSSION: Acute oral glutamine consumption attenuates GI permeability relative to placebo even at lower doses of 0.25 g kg-1, although larger doses may be more effective. It remains unclear if this will lead to reductions in GI symptoms. Athletes competing in the heat may, therefore, benefit from acute glutamine supplementation prior to exercise in order to maintain gastrointestinal integrity.},

It was also found to enhance neuronal excitation and memory function even in normal mice. We hypothesized that diosgenin, either isolated or in an extract, may represent a new category of cognitive enhancers with essential activities that morphologically and functionally reinforce neuronal networks. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a diosgenin-rich yam extract on cognitive enhancement in healthy volunteers. For this placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 28 healthy volunteers (age: 20-81 years) were recruited from Toyama Prefecture, Japan, and was randomly assigned to receive either a yam extract or placebo. Preliminary functional animal experiments indicated that an oil solvent mediated the most efficient distribution of diosgenin into the blood and brain after oral administration, and was a critical factor in the cognitive benefits. Therefore, test samples (placebo and yam extract) were prepared with olive oil and formulated as soft capsules. The intake period was 12 weeks, and a 6-week washout period separated the two crossover intake periods. The Japanese version of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) test was used for neurocognitive assessment, and the adverse effects were monitored through blood testing. Diosgenin-rich yam extract consumption for 12 weeks yielded significant increases in total RBANS score. Among the 12 individual standard cognitive subtests, diosgenin-rich yam extract use significantly improved the semantic fluency. No adverse effects were reported. The diosgenin-rich yam extract treatment appeared to safely enhance cognitive function in healthy adults.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.) contains high levels of anthocyanins which are bioavailable in the kidney and may be protective against ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced acute kidney injury. This study investigated the effect of lingonberry juice on the IR-induced stress-activated signalling pathway and inflammatory response in the kidney.
RESULTS: Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to kidney IR had significantly impaired kidney function, with increased activation of the JNK signalling pathway and increased inflammatory response, measured using a multiplex panel containing an extensive array of inflammatory biomarkers. In rats fed 1 mL lingonberry juice daily for 3 weeks prior to IR, kidney function was protected and attenuation of inflammatory response and JNK signalling was reflected in the reduction of the measured biomarkers. In vitro results in cultured HK-2 cells confirmed that lingonberry anthocyanins reduced JNK signalling and inflammatory gene expression after IR.
CONCLUSION: This study shows, for the first time, that daily supplementation with lingonberry juice may protect against loss of kidney function induced by IR injury by modulating JNK signalling and inhibiting the subsequent inflammatory response. © 2017 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

	abstract = {Background: Three subsets of human monocytes in circulation have been identified and their characterization is still ill-defined. Although glucose and lipid intakes have been demonstrated to exert pro-inflammatory effects on mononuclear cells (MNCs) of healthy subjects, characterization of monocytes phenotypes following macronutrient (glucose, protein, and lipid) intake in humans remains to be determined.
Methods: Thirty-six healthy, normal weight volunteers were recruited in the study. Subjects were randomly assigned into three groups, each group consisting of 12 participants. Each group drank equal calories (300 kcal) of either glucose or lipids or whey proteins. Each subject served as his own control by drinking 300 mL of water 1 week before or after the caloric intake. Baseline blood samples were drawn at 0, 1, 2, and 3-h intervals post caloric or water intakes. MNCs were isolated, and the expression levels of different cluster of differentiation (CD) markers (CD86, CD11c, CD169, CD206, CD163, CD36, CD68, CD11b, CD16, and CD14) and IL-6 were measured by RT-qPCR.
Results: Equicaloric intake of either glucose or lipids or whey proteins resulted in different monocyte phenotypes as demonstrated by changes in the expression levels of CD and polarization markers. Whey proteins intake resulted in significant mRNA upregulation in MNCs of CD68 and CD11b at 1, 2, and 3 h post intake while mRNA of IL-6 was significantly inhibited at 1 h. Lipids intake, on the other hand, resulted in mRNA upregulation of CD11b at 2 and 3 h and CD206 at 1, 2, and 3 h. There were no significant changes in the other CD markers measured (CD86, CD163, CD169, CD36, CD16, and CD14) following either whey proteins or lipids intakes. Glucose intake did not alter mRNA expression of any marker tested except CD206 at 3 h.
Conclusion: Macronutrient intake alters the expression levels of polarization markers in MNCs of human subjects. A distinct population of different monocytes phenotypes may result in human circulation following the intake of different macronutrients. Further studies are required to characterize the immunomodulatory effects of macronutrients intake on monocytes phenotypes and their characteristics in humans.},

Blood lactate concentration was analyzed at rest, immediately after exercise, after 5, 10, and 30 minutes during recovery and the RPE was collected after exercise. The time was significantly (t = 3.316, p = 0.009) lower in the capsaicin (371.6 ± 40.8 seconds) compared with placebo (376.7 ± 39 seconds). Rate of perceived exertion was significantly (t = 2.753, p = 0.022) less in the capsaicin (18.0 ± 1.9) compared with the placebo (18.8 ± 1.3).

Because little is known about the behaviour of anthocyanins during long term intake in humans, several clinical design factors were examined. Urine from volunteers (n = 17) who consumed blueberry juice daily was analysed using LC-MS/MS for predicted flavonoid-based products of anthocyanins in relation to a 5-day anthocyanin-free run-in, 28 days of blueberry juice intake, a 7-day washout and two dosing regimens. Total and parent anthocyanin content in urine varied 10-fold among the 17 participants. A high 24-0 h total anthocyanin excretion was associated with high anthocyanin retention (i.e. 0 h, before blueberry juice intake). Total anthocyanin excretion was not different before and after up to 7 days of washout indicative of a slow release of anthocyanins. Urinary excretion of anthocyanins declined during the 36-day study. The 24-0 h excretion was greater for total anthocyanins but not for parent anthocyanins when daily blueberry juice was taken all at once rather than as ⅓ doses taken thrice daily. However parent anthocyanins were retained better (higher 0 h) with 1× dosing. These findings could aid in the design of clinical research on anthocyanins and health.},

	abstract = {Removal of pesticide residues from fresh produce is important to reduce pesticide exposure to humans. This study investigated the effectiveness of commercial and homemade washing agents in the removal of surface and internalized pesticide residues from apples. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) mapping and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods were used to determine the effectiveness of different washing agents in removing pesticide residues. Surface pesticide residues were most effectively removed by sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, NaHCO3) solution when compared to either tap water or Clorox bleach. Using a 10 mg/mL NaHCO3 washing solution, it took 12 and 15 min to completely remove thiabendazole or phosmet surface residues, respectively, following a 24 h exposure to these pesticides, which were applied at a concentration of 125 ng/cm2. LC-MS/MS results showed, however, that 20\% of applied thiabendazole and 4.4\% of applied phosmet had penetrated into the apples following the 24 h exposure. Thiabendazole, a systemic pesticide, penetrated 4-fold deeper into the apple peel than did phosmet, a non-systemic pesticide, which led to more thiabendazole residues inside the apples, which could not be washed away using the NaHCO3 washing solution. This study gives us the information that the standard postharvest washing method using Clorox bleach solution for 2 min is not an effective means to completely remove pesticide residues on the surface of apples. The NaHCO3 method is more effective in removing surface pesticide residues on apples. In the presence of NaHCO3, thiabendazole and phosmet can degrade, which assists the physical removal force of washing. However, the NaHCO3 method was not completely effective in removing residues that have penetrated into the apple peel. The overall effectiveness of the method to remove all pesticide residues diminished as pesticides penetrated deeper into the fruit. In practical application, washing apples with NaHCO3 solution can reduce pesticides mostly from the surface. Peeling is more effective to remove the penetrated pesticides; however, bioactive compounds in the peels will become lost too.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D blood levels of 60-80ng/ml promote normal sleep. The present study was undertaken to explore why this beneficial effect waned after 2years as arthritic pain increased. Pantothenic acid becomes coenzyme A, a cofactor necessary for cortisol and acetylcholine production. 1950s experiments suggested a connection between pantothenic acid deficiency, autoimmune arthritis and insomnia. The B vitamins have been shown to have an intestinal bacterial source and a food source, suggesting that the normal intestinal microbiome may have always been the primary source of B vitamins. Review of the scientific literature shows that pantothenic acid does not have a natural food source, it is supplied by the normal intestinal bacteria. In order to test the hypothesis that vitamin D replacement slowly induced a secondary pantothenic acid deficiency, B100 (100mg of all B vitamins except 100mcg of B12 and biotin and 400mcg of folate) was added to vitamin D supplementation.
METHODS: Vitamin D and B100 were recommended to over 1000 neurology patients. Sleep characteristics, pain levels, neurologic symptoms, and bowel complaints were recorded by the author at routine appointments.
RESULTS: Three months of vitamin D plus B100 resulted in improved sleep, reduced pain and unexpected resolution of bowel symptoms. These results suggest that the combination of vitamin D plus B100 creates an intestinal environment that favors the return of the four specific species, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria that make up the normal human microbiome.
HYPOTHESES: 1) Seasonal fluctuations in vitamin D levels have normally produced changes in the intestinal microbiome that promoted weight gain in winter. Years of vitamin D deficiency, however, results in a permanently altered intestinal environment that no longer favors the "healthy foursome". 2) Humans have always had a commensal relationship with their intestinal microbiome. We supplied them vitamin D, they supplied us B vitamins. 3) The four species that make up the normal microbiome are also commensal, each excretes at least one B vitamin that the other three need but cannot make. 4) Improved sleep and more cellular repairs eventually depletes body stores of pantothenic acid, causing reduced cortisol production, increased arthritic pain and widespread "pro-inflammatory" effects on the immune system. 5) Pantothenic acid deficiency also decreases available acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter used by the parasympathetic nervous system. Unopposed, increased sympathetic tone then produces hypertension, tachycardia, atrial arrhythmias and a "hyper-adrenergic" state known to predispose to heart disease and stroke.},

The purpose of this study was to determine if 10 days of oral supplementation with BYBG could modify previously observed suppression of monocytes, T cells, circulating and whole blood LPS-stimulated cytokines due to strenuous exercise. Venous blood samples were collected from 109 healthy volunteers prior to, immediately after, 2 and 4 h post-exercise. Monocyte and T cell concentration, cell-surface receptor expression and serum and LPS-stimulated cytokines were assessed. BYBG significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) altered total and classic monocyte concentration and expression of CD38, CD80, CD86, TLR2, and TLR4 on monocyte subsets. BYBG also significantly increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell concentration and the exercise response of CCR7+/CD45RA- central memory (TCM) cells. Likewise, BYBG significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) altered serum IFN-γ and IL-2, and LPS-stimulated IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7. Taken together these data support the hypothesis that oral BYBG supplementation modulates the expected exercise response for individuals of average fitness. This may result in a decrease in susceptibility to opportunistic infections after strenuous exercise.},

	abstract = {Underlying mechanisms responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effect of β-glucan have been proposed, yet have not been fully demonstrated. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether the consumption of barley β-glucan lowers cholesterol by affecting the cholesterol absorption, cholesterol synthesis or bile acid synthesis. In addition, this study was aimed to assess whether the underlying mechanisms are related to cholesterol 7α hydroxylase (CYP7A1) SNP rs3808607 as proposed by us earlier. In a controlled, randomised, cross-over study, participants with mild hypercholesterolaemia (n 30) were randomly assigned to receive breakfast containing 3 g high-molecular weight (HMW), 5 g low-molecular weight (LMW), 3 g LMW barley β-glucan or a control diet, each for 5 weeks. Cholesterol absorption was determined by assessing the enrichment of circulating 13C-cholesterol over 96 h following oral administration; fractional rate of synthesis for cholesterol was assessed by measuring the incorporation rate of 2H derived from deuterium oxide within the body water pool into the erythrocyte cholesterol pool over 24 h; bile acid synthesis was determined by measuring serum 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one concentrations. Consumption of 3 g HMW β-glucan decreased total cholesterol (TC) levels (P=0·029), but did not affect cholesterol absorption (P=0·25) or cholesterol synthesis (P=0·14). Increased bile acid synthesis after consumption of 3 g HMW β-glucan was observed in all participants (P=0·049), and more pronounced in individuals carrying homozygous G of rs3808607 (P=0·033). In addition, a linear relationship between log (viscosity) of β-glucan and serum 7α-HC concentration was observed in homozygous G allele carriers. Results indicate that increased bile acid synthesis rather than inhibition of cholesterol absorption or synthesis may be responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effect of barley β-glucan. The pronounced TC reduction in G allele carriers of rs3808607 observed in the previous study may be due to enhanced bile acid synthesis in response to high-viscosity β-glucan consumption in those individuals.},

METHODS: Subjects with overweight were recruited to a randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group designed trial and randomly allocated to two groups that consumed either 2.5 g/d ALA-TAG or ALA-DAG for 12 weeks. Two 4-week nontreatment periods were placed before and after the treatment period. One hundred fourteen subjects (n = 57 in the ALA-TAG group, n = 57 in the ALA-DAG group) were enrolled into the analysis set for efficacy evaluation.
RESULTS: The VFA and BMI were significantly decreased by the ALA-DAG treatment with a treatment-by-time interaction compared with the ALA-TAG treatment (P {\textless} 0.05). Additionally, the change from baseline of the fasting serum TAG concentration at week 12 was significantly decreased by ALA-DAG treatment compared with ALA-TAG treatment (P {\textless} 0.05). Safety parameters such as urinary measurements, hematologic parameters and blood biochemistry, and the incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between groups, and no ALA-DAG-associated adverse effects were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of ALA-DAG in a regular diet for 12 weeks may lead to a reduction in VFA, BMI, and serum TAG in men and women with overweight.},

	abstract = {Background/Aim: Aggressive tumor malignancies are a consequence of delayed diagnosis, epigenetic/phenotype changes and chemo-radiation resistance. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a major epigenetic regulator of transcriptional repression, which are highly overexpressed in advanced malignancy. While original chemotherapy drugs were modeled after phytochemicals elucidated by botanical screenings, HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) such as apicidin, trichostatin A (TSA) and butyrate were discovered as products of fungus and microbes, in particular, gut microbiota. Therefore, a persistent question remains as to the inherent existence of HDACis in raw undigested dietary plant material. In this study, we conduct a high-throughput (HTP) screening of {\textasciitilde}1,600 non-fermented commonly used nutraceuticals (spices, herbs, teas, vegetables, fruits, seeds, rinds etc.) at ({\textless}600 μg/ml) and food-based polyphenolics ({\textless}240 μg/ml) for evidence of HDAC activity inhibition in nuclear HeLa cell lysates. Materials and Methods: Human HDAC kinetic validation was performed using a standard fluorometric activity assay, followed by an enzymatic-linked immuno-captured ELISA. Both methods were verified using HDACi panel drugs: TSA, apicidin, suberohydroxamic acid, M344, CL-994, valproic acid and sodium phenylbutyrate. The HTP screening was then conducted, followed by a study comparing biological effects of HDACis in HeLa cells, including analysis of whole-transcriptome non-coding RNAs using Affymetrix miRNA 4.1-panel arrays. Results: The HTP screening results confirmed 44/1600 as potential HDACis to which 31 were further eliminated as false-positives. Methodological challenges/concerns are addressed regarding plant product false-positives that arise from the signal reduction of commercial lysine development reagents. Only 13 HDACis were found having an IC50 under {\textless}200 μg/ml: Grapeseed extract (Vitis vinifera), Great burnet root (Sanguisorba Officinalis), Babul (Acacia arabica), Chinese gallnut (Melaphis chinensis), Konaberry extract (Coffea arabica), Uva Ursi (Arctostaphylos uva ursi), Green tea (Camellia sinensis), Meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), Sassafras (Sassafras officinale), Turkey rhubarb (Rheum palmatum), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), gossypol and gallic acid. Next, we investigate the biological consequence of HDACi panel drugs in HeLa cells, where the data suggest predominant effects are anti-mitotic rather than cytotoxic. Lastly, differential effects of TSA vs. GSE at sub-lethal concentrations tested on HeLa cells show 6,631 miRNAs expressed in resting cells, 35 significantly up-regulated (TSA) and 81 up-regulated (GSE), with several miRNAs overlapping in the upward direction by both GSE and TSA (e.g. hsa-miR-23b-5p, hsa-miR-27b-5p, hsa-miR-1180-3p, hsa-miR-6880-5p and hsa-mir-943). Using DIANA miRNA online tools, it was determined that GSE and TSA simultaneously cause overexpression of similar miRNAs predicted to destroy the following influential oncogenes: NFkB, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, MYC, TGFBR1, E2F1, E2F2, BCL21, CDKN1A, CDK6, HIF1a, and VEGFA. Conclusion: The data from this study show that plant- based HDACis are relatively rare, and can elicit a similar pattern to TSA in up-regulating miRNAs involved with tumor suppression of HeLa cervical carcinoma.},

The mechanism of action (MOA) of LA's efficacy in suppression of MS pathology is incompletely understood. LA stimulates production of the immunomodulator cyclic AMP (cAMP) in vitro. To determine whether cAMP could be involved in the MOA of LA in vivo, we performed a clinical trial to examine whether LA stimulates cAMP production in healthy control and MS subjects, and whether there are differences in the bioavailability of LA between groups. We administered 1200 mg of oral LA to healthy control, relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and SPMS subjects, and measured plasma LA and cAMP levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). There were no significant differences between the groups in pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. Healthy and SPMS subjects had increased cAMP at 2 and 4 h post-LA treatment compared to baseline, while RRMS subjects showed decreases in cAMP. Additionally, plasma concentrations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, a known cAMP stimulator) were significantly lower in female RRMS subjects compared to female HC and SPMS subjects 4 h after LA ingestion. These data indicate that cAMP could be part of the MOA of LA in SPMS, and that there is a divergent response to LA in RRMS subjects that may have implications in the efficacy of immunomodulatory drugs.

DNP had no effect on the EEM of aortic segments from HFSP mice. In conclusion, sweet potato attenuates diet-induced aortic stiffness independent of body mass and composition, which is associated with a normalization of arterial oxidative stress possibly due to mitochondrial uncoupling.},

RESULTS: The study groups did not differ at baseline and were characterized by [median (range)] serum cobalamin [128 (68-191) pmol/L], holotranscobalamin [16 (6-41) pmol/L], methylmalonic acid [0.8 (0.3-1.7) µmol/L], homocysteine [17.9 (8.5-100.9) µmol/L], and a combined indicator of B12 status 4cB12 of - 1.65 (- 0.64 to - 4.07). The group supplemented with cyano-B12 showed a higher increase in total serum cobalamin than the group treated with hydroxo-B12, while other biomarkers changed comparably in the two groups. After 8 weeks of treatment, the biomarker values of the supplemented groups (pooled) differed significantly from the placebo group. Yet, the vitamin B12 status was still poor [cobalamin: 168 (87-302) pmol/L; holotranscobalamin: 19 (8-45) pmol/L; methylmalonic acid: 0.7 (0.2-1.7) µmol/L; homocysteine: 17.2 (2.6-96.8) µmol/L; 4cB12 = - 1.34 (- 0.33 to - 3.3)].
CONCLUSION: 8-week supplementation with 3-µg cyano-B12 elevated serum cobalamin more than 3 µg hydroxo-B12, but all other biomarkers changed similarly in both groups. Supplementation with 3 µg vitamin B12 did not reverse the low status in individuals with nutritional vitamin B12 deficiency.

	abstract = {Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) functions as a coenzyme for a critical methyl transfer reaction that converts homocysteine to methionine and for a separate reaction that converts l-methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to succinyl-CoA. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin B12 is based on the amount needed for the maintenance of hematological status and normal serum vitamin B12 values. An assumed absorption of 50 percent is included in the recommended intake. The RDA for adults is 2.4 μg/day of vitamin B12. Because 10 to 30 percent of older people may be unable to absorb naturally occurring vitamin B12, it is advisable for those older than 50 years to meet their RDA mainly by consuming foods fortified with vitamin B12 or a vitamin B12-containing supplement. Individuals with vitamin B12 deficiency caused by a lack of intrinsic factor require medical treatment. The median intake of vitamin B12 from food in the United States was estimated to be approximately 5 μg/day for men and 3.5 μg/day for women. The ninety-fifth percentile of vitamin B12 intake from both food and supplements was approximately 27 μg/day. In one Canadian province the mean dietary intake was estimated to be approximately 7 μg/day for men and 4 μg/day for women. There is not sufficient scientific evidence to set a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for vitamin B12 at this time.},

We aimed to investigate whether there was an association between dietary phenolic acid consumption and prostate cancer (PCa) in South Italy. We conducted a population-based case-control study from January 2015 to December 2016 in a single institution of the municipality of Catania, southern Italy (Registration number: 41/2015). Patients with elevated PSA and/or suspicious PCa underwent transperineal prostate biopsy. A total of 118 histopathological-verified PCa cases were collected and a total of 222 controls were selected from a sample of 2044 individuals. Dietary data were collected by using two food frequency questionnaires and data on the phenolic acids content in foods was obtained from the Phenol-Explorer database (www.phenol-explorer.eu). Association between dietary intake of phenolic acids and PCa was calculated through logistic regression analysis. We found lower levels of caffeic acid (2.28 mg/day vs. 2.76 mg/day; p {\textless} 0.05) and ferulic acid (2.80 mg/day vs. 4.04 mg/day; p {\textless} 0.01) in PCa when compared to controls. The multivariate logistic regression showed that both caffeic acid (OR = 0.32; p {\textless} 0.05) and ferulic acid (OR = 0.30; p {\textless} 0.05) were associated with reduced risk of PCa. Higher intake of hydroxybenzoic acids and caffeic acids were associated with lower risk of advanced PCa. High intake of caffeic acid and ferulic acid may be associated with reduced risk of PCa.},

The aim of this study was to investigate if adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a lower prevalence of OA of the knee in a large cohort from North America.
METHODS: 4358 community-dwelling participants (2527 females; mean age: 61.2 years) from the Osteoarthritis Initiative were included. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated through a validated Mediterranean diet score (aMED) categorized into quartiles (Q). Knee OA was diagnosed both clinically and radiologically. The strength of the association between aMED (divided in quartiles) and knee OA was investigated through a logistic regression analysis and reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Participants with a higher adherence to Mediterranean diet had a significantly lower prevalence of knee OA compared to those with lower adherence (Q4: 25.2\% vs. Q1: 33.8\%; p {\textless} 0.0001). Using a logistic regression analysis, adjusting for 10 potential confounders with those in the lowest quartile of aMED as reference, participants with the highest aMED had a significant reduction in presence of knee OA (OR, 0.83; 95\% CIs: 0.69-0.99, p = 0.04). Among the individual components of Mediterranean diet, only higher use of cereals was associated with lower odds of having knee OA (OR: 0.76; 95\%CI: 0.60-0.98; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with lower prevalence of knee OA. This remained when adjusting for potential confounders.},

Blueberry possesses antidepressant properties which may improve autoimmunity and reduce gastrointestinal infection. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) performs antidepressant function and can be regulated by miR-155, which may be affected by blueberry. To explore the possible molecular mechanism, blueberry compounds were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Activity of compounds was tested by using HT22 cells. The present study tested 124 patients with CVT-induced mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale [CES-D] â‰¥16) and gastrointestinal infection. Patients were randomly assigned to blueberry extract group (BG, received 10 mg blueberry extract daily) and placebo group (PG, received 10 mg placebo daily). After 3 months, depression, gastrointestinal infection and lipid profiles were investigated. Serum miR-155 and BDNF were measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and or Western Blot. Blueberry treatment improved depressive symptoms and lipid profiles, and also reduced gastrointestinal infection in the BG group (P {\textless} 0.05) but those of the PG group (P = 1). These changes were paralleled by increase in serum levels of BDNF and miR-155 (P {\textless} 0.05). HPLC analysis showed that blueberry extracts were the main phenolic acids with 0.18, 0.85, 0.26, 0.72, 0.66, 0.4,1, and 1.92 mg/g of gentisic acid, chlorogenic acid, [2]-epicatechin, p-coumaric acid, benzoic acid, p-anisic acid, and quercetin in blueberry extracts, respectively. Phenolics in blueberry are possible causal agents in improving antidepressant activity and reducing gastrointestinal infection. Administration of blueberry increased BDNF expression and miR-155. Blueberry cannot affect BDNF level when miR-155 is overexpressed or inhibited. Phenolics from blueberry reduced gastrointestinal infection of patients with CVT by improving antidepressant activity via upregulation of miR-155-mediated BDNF.},

	abstract = {Oxidative stress accelerates skin aging, and dietary supplementation with antioxidants may alleviate it. Morphological analysis of the residual skin surface components (RSSCs) allows detecting age-related changes in corneocyte desquamation, microbial presence, and lipid droplet size. We hypothesized that continuous ingestion of carotenoid antioxidant astaxanthin (4 mg/d) for 4 weeks could influence RSCC morphology and evaluated RSSC samples taken from middle-aged subjects before and after this dietary intervention. The study included 31 volunteers (17 men and 14 women) over the age of 40. RSSC samples were collected from the surface of the facial skin at the beginning (day 0) and end (day 29) of the study. In addition, blood samples were taken on days 0, 15, and 29 for measuring plasma levels of malondialdehyde that allowed assessing systemic oxidative stress. The results demonstrated that plasma malondialdehyde consistently decreased during astaxanthin consumption (by 11.2\% on day 15 and by 21.7\% on day 29). The analysis of RSSC samples has revealed significantly decreased levels of corneocyte desquamation (P=.0075) and microbial presence (P=.0367) at the end of the study. These phenomena as well as a significant (P=.0214) increase in lipid droplet size were more strongly manifested among obese (body mass index {\textgreater}30 kg/m2) subjects. All described RSSC changes correspond to a shift toward characteristics of skin associated with a younger age. The results confirm our hypothesis by demonstrating that continuous astaxanthin consumption produces a strong antioxidant effect resulting in facial skin rejuvenation which is especially pronounced in obese subjects.},

METHODS: In this uncontrolled, change from baseline study design, insulin sensitivity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion were measured in 9 normal glucose tolerant subjects before and after 3 day lipid infusion to elevate plasma FFA concentration. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained and mitochondrial function, PGC-1α expression, and PGC-1α promoter methylation were quantitated.
RESULTS: Increased plasma FFA (440±93 μmol/Lto 997±242 μM, p{\textless}0.001) decreased insulin-stimulated total glucose disposal (TGD) by 25\% (p = 0.008), impaired suppression of endogenous glucose production (p = 0.01), and reduced mitochondrial ATP synthesis with complex 1 (34\%, p{\textless}0.05) and complex 2 (30\%, p{\textless}0.05) substrates. Lipid infusion had no effect on muscle PGC-1α RNA expression, total methylation or non-CpG methylation, but methylation of the alternative PGC-1α promoter decreased (1.30±0.30 to 0.84±0.15\% methylated residues/patient•strand, p = 0.055). Within PGC-1α promoter there was demethylation of CpT residues (0.72±0.16 vs. 0.28±0.10 methylated residues/patient•strand) (p = 0.002), which was inversely correlated with PGC-1α mRNA expression (r = -0.94, p{\textless}0.0001) and ATP synthesis with complex 1 (r = -0.80, p{\textless}0.01) and complex 2 (r = -0.69, p{\textless}0.05) substrates. Lipid infusion increased DNMT-3B (methyltransferase associated with PGC-1α promoter non-CpG methylation) mRNA expression (0.87 ± 0.09 to 1.62 ± 0.22 arbitrary units, p = 0.005), which correlated inversely with CpT demethylation (r = 0.67, p{\textless}0.05).
CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Physiologic plasma FFA elevation in NGT individuals has opposing effects on PGC-1α non-CpG residue methylation (CpT demethylation and increased DNMT-3B expression), which is correlated with changes in PGC-1α expression and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function.},

	abstract = {Glucosamine, used to treat osteoarthritis, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects in experimental studies. A recent cohort study has demonstrated that the use of glucosamine was significantly associated with decreased total mortality. Vascular endothelial function is a potent surrogate marker of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular mortality where oxidative stress could participate. Therefore, we investigated whether glucosamine improves vascular endothelial function and intracellular redox state. We examined the effects of oral glucosamine administration (3000 mg/day) for 4 weeks on flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) and intraerythrocyte glutathione parameters in 20 volunteers. Nineteen age-matched volunteers served as controls. Glucosamine administration significantly increased FMD (from 7.0 ± 2.3 to 8.7 ± 2.3\%, P = 0.022). In the control group, FMD did not change. Glucosamine administration significantly increased intraerythrocyte total glutathione levels (from 212.9 ± 46.2 to 240.6 ± 49.4 μmol/L, P = 0.006), intraerythrocyte reduced form of glutathione (GSH) levels (from 124.7 ± 42.6 to 155.2 ± 47.7 μmol/L; P = 0.004) and intraerythrocyte GSH/oxidized form of glutathione (GSSG) ratios (from 3.18 ± 1.64 to 3.88 ± 1.61, P = 0.04). In the control group, any glutathione parameters did not change. Moreover, a stepwise multivariate analysis revealed percent change of GSH/GSSG is the only independent predictor for those of FMD (standardized β = 0.58, P = 0.007) in the glucosamine group. Glucosamine administration improved FMD in association with amelioration of intraerythrocyte GSH/GSSG ratios. These results suggest that oral glucosamine administration might improve vascular endothelial function by modulating intracellular redox state.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Currently there is considerable interest in ketone metabolism owing to recently reported benefits of ketosis for human health. Traditionally, ketosis has been achieved by following a high-fat, low-carbohydrate "ketogenic" diet, but adherence to such diets can be difficult. An alternative way to increase blood D-β-hydroxybutyrate (D-βHB) concentrations is ketone drinks, but the metabolic effects of exogenous ketones are relatively unknown. Here, healthy human volunteers took part in three randomized metabolic studies of drinks containing a ketone ester (KE); (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate, or ketone salts (KS); sodium plus potassium βHB. Methods and Results: In the first study, 15 participants consumed KE or KS drinks that delivered {\textasciitilde}12 or {\textasciitilde}24 g of βHB. Both drinks elevated blood D-βHB concentrations (D-βHB Cmax: KE 2.8 mM, KS 1.0 mM, P {\textless} 0.001), which returned to baseline within 3-4 h. KS drinks were found to contain 50\% of the L-βHB isoform, which remained elevated in blood for over 8 h, but was not detectable after 24 h. Urinary excretion of both D-βHB and L-βHB was {\textless}1.5\% of the total βHB ingested and was in proportion to the blood AUC. D-βHB, but not L-βHB, was slowly converted to breath acetone. The KE drink decreased blood pH by 0.10 and the KS drink increased urinary pH from 5.7 to 8.5. In the second study, the effect of a meal before a KE drink on blood D-βHB concentrations was determined in 16 participants. Food lowered blood D-βHB Cmax by 33\% (Fed 2.2 mM, Fasted 3.3 mM, P {\textless} 0.001), but did not alter acetoacetate or breath acetone concentrations. All ketone drinks lowered blood glucose, free fatty acid and triglyceride concentrations, and had similar effects on blood electrolytes, which remained normal. In the final study, participants were given KE over 9 h as three drinks (n = 12) or a continuous nasogastric infusion (n = 4) to maintain blood D-βHB concentrations greater than 1 mM. Both drinks and infusions gave identical D-βHB AUC of 1.3-1.4 moles.min. Conclusion: We conclude that exogenous ketone drinks are a practical, efficacious way to achieve ketosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cinnamon is considered as a treatment for many ailments in native medicine. Evidence suggests that Cinnamomum zeylanicum (CZ) has anti-microbial, anti-parasitic, anti-oxidant, blood glucose lowering properties and beneficial cardiovascular effects. The present study aims to evaluate Pharmacodynamic properties and safety of CZ in healthy adults using a Phase I Clinical Trial.
METHODS: This phase I clinical trial was conducted at the Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. Thirty healthy adults were recruited for the study, conducted for a period of 3 months, with the dose of CZ (water extract) increased at monthly intervals (85 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg). Data collection was carried out at baseline and during each monthly follow up visit. Anthropometric, clinical and biochemical assessments were done at baseline and during follow up. Adverse effects and drug compliance was also evaluated.
RESULTS: Twenty eight subjects completed the three months follow up. Mean age was 38.8 ± 10.4 years and 50\% were males. There were no significant changes in the anthropometric parameters during the three months follow up. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduced significant during the 1st month and this reduction was sustained throughout follow up. Full blood count, renal function tests, liver function tests, fasting blood glucose, HDL-c, VLDL-d and triglycerides remained within the normal range without any significant alteration during the 3 months. A significant reduction in the TC (p {\textless} 0.05) and LDL-c (p {\textless} 0.001) was noted at the end of the 3 months follow up period. There were no serious adverse effects (including hypersensitivity) noted. In two participants dyspepsia necessitated the discontinuation of study participation. Drug compliance was between 85 and 95\% during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first phase I clinical trial in health adults evaluating efficacy and safety of CZ. Our results demonstrate no significant side effects and toxicity of CZ, including hepatotoxicity and anti-coagulation properties. CZ demonstrated beneficial anti-hyperlipidaemic and blood pressure lowering effects among healthy adults. Further studies with larger samples and longer durations may be able to elucidate other side effects and better describe the pharmacodynamic properties.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To increase understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the association, we investigated the individual relations to cognitive decline of the primary nutrients and bioactives in green leafy vegetables, including vitamin K (phylloquinone), lutein, β-carotene, nitrate, folate, kaempferol, and α-tocopherol.
METHODS: This was a prospective study of 960 participants of the Memory and Aging Project, ages 58-99 years, who completed a food frequency questionnaire and had ≥2 cognitive assessments over a mean 4.7 years.
RESULTS: In a linear mixed model adjusted for age, sex, education, participation in cognitive activities, physical activities, smoking, and seafood and alcohol consumption, consumption of green leafy vegetables was associated with slower cognitive decline; the decline rate for those in the highest quintile of intake (median 1.3 servings/d) was slower by β = 0.05 standardized units (p = 0.0001) or the equivalent of being 11 years younger in age. Higher intakes of each of the nutrients and bioactives except β-carotene were individually associated with slower cognitive decline. In the adjusted models, the rates for the highest vs the lowest quintiles of intake were β = 0.02, p = 0.002 for phylloquinone; β = 0.04, p = 0.002 for lutein; β = 0.05, p {\textless} 0.001 for folate; β = 0.03, p = 0.02 for α-tocopherol; β = 0.04, p = 0.002 for nitrate; β = 0.04, p = 0.003 for kaempferol; and β = 0.02, p = 0.08 for β-carotene.
CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of approximately 1 serving per day of green leafy vegetables and foods rich in phylloquinone, lutein, nitrate, folate, α-tocopherol, and kaempferol may help to slow cognitive decline with aging.},

Here we describe the features and mutational landscape of DNA damage caused by acetaldehyde, an endogenous and alcohol-derived metabolite. This damage results in DNA double-stranded breaks that, despite stimulating recombination repair, also cause chromosome rearrangements. We combined transplantation of single haematopoietic stem cells with whole-genome sequencing to show that this damage occurs in stem cells, leading to deletions and rearrangements that are indicative of microhomology-mediated end-joining repair. Moreover, deletion of p53 completely rescues the survival of aldehyde-stressed and mutated haematopoietic stem cells, but does not change the pattern or the intensity of genome instability within individual stem cells. These findings characterize the mutation of the stem-cell genome by an alcohol-derived and endogenous source of DNA damage. Furthermore, we identify how the choice of DNA-repair pathway and a stringent p53 response limit the transmission of aldehyde-induced mutations in stem cells.},

We evaluated in a preliminary manner, the pharmacokinetics (PK) and initial safety analysis of (+)-epicatechin ((+)-Epi) in healthy and pre-diabetic subjects. Using a mouse model of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, we also evaluated the metabolic effects of (+)-Epi vs. (+)-catechin (Cat) to determine class effects. In the Phase I PK study, subjects were provided a single incremental oral dose of (+)-Epi (10, 30 or 100 mg). For the PD study, subjects were provided a single 30 mg dose per day for 7 days. Blood samples were collected and safety measures were performed. Incremental doses of (+)-Epi increase the half-life of blood metabolites from 1.2-4.9 h. The compound was well tolerated and no adverse effects were reported. Seven day dosing of pre-diabetic subjects led to tendencies for reductions in circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, which returned to baseline by 7 days after treatment. In animals, 2 weeks of oral dosing (0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg kg-1 day-1) dose dependently improved metabolism-related endpoints (weight gain, glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, with thresholds as low as 0.01 mg kg-1 day-1). Cat yielded no effects at 0.1 mg kg-1 day-1. Results indicate that (+)-Epi evidences a favorable PK and safety profile. Using a pre-clinical model, the compound positively modulates metabolism, which may link to mitochondrial effects. Effects are not due to general antioxidant actions, as Cat yielded no effects.},

The present translational study aimed to determine safety and tolerability of a wheat germ extract containing enhanced spermidine concentrations. In a preclinical toxicity study, supplementation of spermidine using this extract did not result in morbidities or changes in behavior in BALBc/Rj mice during the 28-days repeated-dose tolerance study. Post mortem examination of the mice organs showed no increase in tumorigenic and fibrotic events. In the human cohort (participants with subjective cognitive decline, n=30, 60 to 80 years of age), a 3-month randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase II trial was conducted with supplementation of the spermidine-rich plant extract (dosage: 1.2 mg/day). No differences were observed between spermidine and placebo-treated groups in vital signs, weight, clinical chemistry and hematological parameters of safety, as well as in self-reported health status at the end of intervention. Compliance rates above 85\% indicated excellent tolerability. The data demonstrate that spermidine supplementation using a spermidine-rich plant extract is safe and well-tolerated in mice and older adults. These findings allow for longer-term intervention studies in humans to investigate the impact of spermidine treatment on cognition and brain integrity.},

Identifying novel oral disease-modifying therapies for MS, targeting both its inflammatory and neurodegenerative components is still a major goal.
AIM: The scope of this study was to provide evidence that the oral administration of C-Phycocyanin (C-PC), the main biliprotein of the Spirulina platensis cyanobacteria and its tetrapyrrolic prosthetic group, Phycocyanobilin (PCB), exert ameliorating actions on rodent models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).
MAIN METHODS: EAE was induced in Lewis rats using the spinal cord encephalitogen from Sprague Dawley rats and in C57BL6 mice with MOG35-55 peptide. Clinical signs, motor function, oxidative stress markers, cytokine levels by ELISA and transmission electron microscopy analysis were assessed.
KEY FINDINGS: Either prophylactic or early therapeutic administration of C-PC to Lewis rats with EAE, significantly improved clinical signs and restored the motor function of the animals. Furthermore, C-PC positively modulated oxidative stress markers measured in brain homogenate and serum and protected the integrity of cerebral myelin sheaths as shown by transmission electron microscopy analysis. In C57BL/6 mice with EAE, PCB orally improved clinical status of the animals and reduced the expression levels of brain IL-6 and IFN-γ proinflammatory cytokines.
SIGNIFICANCE: These results, for the first time, support the fact that both C-PC and PCB administered orally could potentially improve neuroinflammation, protect from demyelination and axonal loss, which may be translated into an improved quality of life for MS patients.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Aerobic exercise is known to acutely improve cognitive functions, such as executive function (EF) and memory function (MF). Additionally, consumption of flavanol-rich cocoa has been reported to acutely improve cognitive function. The aim of this study was to determine whether high cocoa flavanol (CF; HCF) consumption would enhance exercise-induced improvement in cognitive function. To test this hypothesis, we examined the combined effects of HCF consumption and moderate-intensity exercise on EF and MF during postexercise recovery.
METHODS: Ten healthy young men received either an HCF (563 mg of CF) or energy-matched low CF (LCF; 38 mg of CF) beverage 70 min before exercise in a single-blind counterbalanced manner. The men then performed moderate-intensity cycling exercise at 60\% of peak oxygen uptake for 30 min. The participants performed a color-word Stroop task and face-name matching task to evaluate EF and MF, respectively, during six time periods throughout the experimental session.
RESULTS: EF significantly improved immediately after exercise compared with before exercise in both conditions. However, EF was higher after HCF consumption than after LCF consumption during all time periods because HCF consumption improved EF before exercise. In contrast, HCF consumption and moderate-intensity exercise did not improve MF throughout the experiment.
CONCLUSION: The present findings demonstrated that HCF consumption before moderate-intensity exercise could enhance exercise-induced improvement in EF, but not in MF. Therefore, we suggest that the combination of HCF consumption and aerobic exercise may be beneficial for improving EF.},

These polyphenols are absorbed and metabolized to various phenolic metabolites/conjugates in the body, which may play a role in disease risk reduction. In the present study, we investigated the metabolic fate of strawberry polyphenols after chronic (90 days) supplementation of freeze-dried strawberry (24 g d-1, equivalent to 2 cups of fresh strawberries) vs. control powder in 19 healthy older adults. Blood samples were collected at two time-points i.e., fasting (t = 0 h) and 2 h after the breakfast meal. On days 45 and 90 breakfast also included a control or strawberry drink consistent with their treatment randomization. A total of 21 polyphenolic metabolites were quantified in plasma consisting of 3 anthocyanins/metabolites, 3 urolithin metabolites and 15 phenolic acid metabolites. Among anthocyanins/metabolite, pelargonidin glucuronide (85.7 Â± 9.0 nmol L-1, t = 2 h, day 90) was present in the highest concentration. Persistent concentrations of anthocyanins/metabolites, urolithins and some phenolic acids were observed in fasting (t = 0 h) plasma samples on day 45 and 90 after strawberry drink consumption suggesting a role of enteric, enterohepatic recycling or upregulation of gut microbial and/or human metabolism of these compounds. Our results suggest that strawberry polyphenols are absorbed and extensively metabolized, and can persist in the circulation.},

Phase II of the VitDbol vitamin D intervention trial (NCT02063334) involved a proof-of-principle study of one individual, who was exposed three times every 28 days to an oral bolus (2000 μg) of vitamin D3. Blood samples were taken directly before each supplementation as well as one and two days after, chromatin was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells without any further in vitro culture and at all nine time points epigenome-wide chromatin accessibility was assessed by applying FAIRE-seq (formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements sequencing). The vitamin D3 bolus resulted in an average raise in 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) serum concentration of 11.9 and 19.4 nM within one and two days, respectively. Consistently accessible chromatin was detected at 5205 genomic loci, the 853 most prominent of which a self-organizing map algorithm classified into early, delayed and non-responding genomic regions: 70 loci showed already after one day and 361 sites after two days significant (p {\textless} 0.0001) chromatin opening or closing. Interestingly, more than half of these genomic regions overlap with transcription start sites, but the change of chromatin accessibility at these sites has no direct effect on the transcriptome. Some of the vitamin D responsive chromatin sites cluster at specific loci within the human genome, the most prominent of which is the human leukocyte antigen region in chromosome 6. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that under in vivo conditions a rather minor rise in 25(OH)D3 serum levels is sufficient to result in significant changes at hundreds of sites within the epigenome of human leukocytes.},

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the incidence of GDM with two different dietary models. All consecutive normoglycemic ({\textless}92 mg/dL) pregnant women at 8-12 gestational weeks (GW) were assigned to Intervention Group (IG, n = 500): MedDiet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and pistachios; or Control Group (CG, n = 500): standard diet with limited fat intake. Primary outcome was to assess the effect of the intervention on GDM incidence at 24-28 GW. Gestational weight gain (GWG), pregnancy-induced hypertension, caesarean section (CS), preterm delivery, perineal trauma, small and large for gestational age (SGA and LGA) and admissions to neonatal intensive care unit were also assessed. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.
RESULTS: A total of 874 women completed the study (440/434, CG/IG). According to nutritional questionnaires and biomarker analysis, women in the IG had a good adherence to the intervention. 177/874 women were diagnosed with GDM, 103/440 (23.4\%) in CG and 74/434(17.1\%) in IG, p = 0.012. The crude relative risk (RR) for GDM was 0.73 (95\% CI: 0.56-0.95; p = 0.020) IG vs CG and persisted after adjusted multivariable analysis, 0.75(95\% CI: 0.57-0.98; p = 0.039). IG had also significantly reduced rates of insulin-treated GDM, prematurity, GWG at 24-28 and 36-38 GW, emergency CS, perineal trauma, and SGA and LGA newborns (all p{\textless}0.05).

However, curcumin therapeutic use is limited because of its low systemic bioavailability and chemical stability as it undergoes rapid hydrolysis in physiological conditions. Recently, much attention has been paid to the biological properties of curcumin degradation products as potential bioactive molecules. Between them, vanillin, a natural vanilla extract, is a stable degradation product of curcumin that could be responsible for mediating its beneficial effects. We have analyzed the effect of vanillin, in comparison with curcumin, in the amyloid aggregation process of insulin as well as its ability to prevent the formation of the advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Employing biophysical, biochemical and cell based assays, we show that vanillin and curcumin similarly affect insulin amyloid aggregation promoting the formation of harmless fibrils. Moreover, vanillin restrains AGE formation and protects from AGE-induced cytotoxicity. Our novel findings not only suggest that the main health benefits observed for curcumin can be ascribed to its degradation product vanillin, but also open new avenues for developing therapeutic applications of curcumin degradation products.},

	abstract = {Supplementation with high doses of folic acid, an important mediator of one-carbon transfers for DNA methylation, is used clinically to improve sperm parameters in infertile men. We recently detected an unexpected loss of DNA methylation in the sperm of idiopathic infertile men after 6 months of daily supplementation with 5 mg folic acid ({\textgreater}10× the daily recommended intake-DRI), exacerbated in men homozygous for a common variant in the gene encoding an important enzyme in folate metabolism, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677C{\textgreater}T). To investigate the epigenomic impact and mechanism underlying effects of folic acid on male germ cells, wild-type and heterozygote mice for a targeted inactivation of the Mthfr gene were fed high-dose folic acid (10× the DRI) or control diets (CDs) for 6 months. No changes were detected in general health, sperm counts or methylation of imprinted genes. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing revealed sperm DNA hypomethylation in Mthfr+/- mice on the 10× diets. Wild-type mice demonstrated sperm hypomethylation only with a very high dose (20×) of folic acid for 12 months. Testicular MTHFR protein levels decreased significantly in wild-type mice on the 20× diet but not in those on the 10× diet, suggesting a possible role for MTHFR deficiency in sperm DNA hypomethylation. In-depth analysis of the folic acid-exposed sperm DNA methylome suggested mouse/human susceptibility of sequences with potential importance to germ cell and embryo development. Our data provide evidence for a similar cross-species response to high dose folic acid supplementation, of sperm DNA hypomethylation, and implicate MTHFR downregulation as a possible mechanism.},

	abstract = {Salt, promoting oxidative stress, contributes to insulin resistance, whereas K, inhibiting oxidative stress, improves insulin sensitivity. Oxidative stress activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is a central player in the induction of insulin resistance. Therefore, we hypothesised that NLRP3 inflammasome may mediate the effects of salt and K on insulin resistance. In all, fifty normotensive subjects were recruited from a rural community of Northern China. The protocol included a low-salt diet for 7 d, then a high-salt diet for 7 d and a high-salt diet with K supplementation for another 7 d. In addition, THP-1 cells were cultured in different levels of Na with and without K. The results showed that salt loading elevated fasting blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels, as well as insulin resistance, whereas K supplementation reversed them. Meanwhile, additional K reversed the active effects of high salt on NLRP3 inflammasome in both the subjects and THP-1 cells, and the change of insulin resistance index notably related with the alteration of plasma IL-1β, the index of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, during intervention in the subjects. Additional K ameliorated oxidative stress induced by high salt in both the subjects and cultured THP-1 cells, and the change of oxidative stress related with the alteration of plasma IL-1β during intervention in the subjects. In vitro, antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine significantly prevented the active effects of high Na or oxidant Rosup on NLRP3 inflammasome, so did K. Our study indicates that oxidative stress modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome may be involved in the impacts of Na and K on insulin resistance.},

	abstract = {Coffee is a widely consumed beverage worldwide and is believed to help prevent the occurrence of various chronic diseases. However, the effect of coffee on skeletal muscle hypertrophy, differentiation and the mechanisms of action responsible have remained unclear. To investigate the effect of coffee on skeletal muscle hypertrophy, mice were fed a normal diet or a normal diet supplemented with 0.3\% coffee or 1\% coffee. Coffee supplementation was observed to increase skeletal muscle hypertrophy, while simultaneously upregulating protein expression of total MHC, MHC2A, and MHC2B in quadricep muscle. Myostatin expression was also attenuated, and IGF1 was upregulated with subsequent phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR, while AMPK phosphorylation was attenuated. Coffee also increased the grip strength and PGC-1α protein expression, and decreased the expressions of TGF-β and myostatin in tricep muscle. Coffee activated the MKK3/6-p38 pathway and upregulated PGC-1α, which may play a role in promoting myogenic differentiation and myogenin expression in C2C12 cells. These results suggest that coffee increases skeletal muscle function and hypertrophy by regulating the TGF-β/myostatin - Akt - mTORC1.},

Objective: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to establish if daily breakfast consumption or fasting until noon modifies the acute metabolic and appetitive responses to a fixed breakfast and ad libitum lunch.
Methods: With the use of a parallel group design, we randomly assigned 31 healthy, lean men and women (22-56 y) to 6 wk of either consuming ≥700 kcal of self-selected items before 1100 or fasting (0 kcal) until 1200 daily. Following 48 h of diet and physical activity standardization, we examined metabolic and appetite responses to a standardized breakfast and ad libitum lunch before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using 3- and 2-way ANCOVA.
Results: Systemic concentrations of energy balance regulatory hormones total and acylated ghrelin, leptin, and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine) responded similarly to breakfast and lunch before and after 6 wk of either morning fasting or regular breakfast, with the exception of a tendency for increased glucagon-like peptide-1 concentrations from baseline to follow-up in the Breakfast Group compared with a decrease over that period in the Fasting Group [P = 0.06, partial eta squared value (ƞ2) = 0.16]. Subjective appetite sensations also did not differ over the course of the day, and ad libitum energy intake at lunch was not systematically affected by either intervention, decreasing by 27 kcal (95\% CI: -203, 149 kcal) with fasting and by 77 kcal (95\% CI: -210, 56 kcal) with breakfast. Similarly, glycemic, insulinemic, lipemic, and thermogenic responses to breakfast and lunch were very stable at baseline and follow-up and, thus, did not differ between treatment groups.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that a sustained period of either extended morning fasting or eating a daily breakfast has minimal effect upon acute metabolic and appetite responses in lean adults. This trial was registered at www.isrctn.org as ISRCTN31521726.},

	abstract = {Background: Diets with a high glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) have been hypothesized to increase oxidative stress, but the limited human studies are inconsistent.
Objective: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate associations between dietary GI, GL, and carbohydrate intake and oxidative stress, as measured by F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs).
Methods: Concentrations of F2-IsoP and its metabolite (15-F2t-IsoP-M) were measured in urine samples collected at enrollment from 866 premenopausal women (aged 35-54 y) participating in the Sister Study. Total carbohydrate intake and dietary GI and GL were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Urinary F2-IsoP and 15-F2t-IsoP-M concentrations were compared across quintiles of carbohydrate intake, GI, and GL using multivariable linear regression models.
Results: Urinary F2-IsoP concentrations were positively associated with dietary GI (P-trend = 0.023), and both F2-IsoP and 15-F2t-IsoP-M concentrations were positively associated with GL (F2-IsoP: P-trend {\textless} 0.001; 15-F2t-IsoP-M: P-trend {\textless} 0.001) and total carbohydrate intake (F2-IsoP: P-trend = 0.012; 15-F2t-IsoP-M: P-trend {\textless} 0.001). Stratified analyses suggested that a positive association between GI and urinary 15-F2t-IsoP-M concentrations was present among women with a body mass index [BMI (in kg/m2)] â‰¥30.0, but not among those with a BMI of {\textless}25.0 or 25.0-29.9 (P-interaction = 0.01).
Conclusions: Our cross-sectional analyses in a sample of premenopausal women support hypothesized relations between high dietary GI and GL and oxidative stress, as assessed by urinary F2-IsoP and 15-F2t-IsoP-M concentrations. Given potential associations between oxidative stress and the development of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, our findings may have important implications for reducing chronic disease risk.},

We searched the following databases through November 2017: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The relevant data were extracted and assessed for quality of the studies according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data were pooled using the inverse variance method and expressed as Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) with 95\% Confidence Intervals (95\% CI). Heterogeneity between studies was assessed by the Cochran Q statistic and I-squared tests (I2). Overall, 14 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Fourteen RCTs with 473 subjects were included in our meta-analysis.

Therefore, a systematic review was carried out of relevant randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in order to assess the effect of berries (blueberry and cranberry) consumption on type 2 diabetes (T2DM) glycemic control. Some evidences were also discussed on the anti-diabetic mechanisms exerted by berries polyphenols. Studies were identified by searching electronic databases: LILACS, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Three authors independently searched and extracted RCTs in which the effect of berries (cranberry or blueberry) consumption on T2DM glycemic control was assessed. A total of 7 RCTs, involving 270 adults with type 2 diabetes were included. Despite the heterogeneity of the administration forms (in natura, dried, extract, preparations - juice), dosage, duration of the intervention and type of population of the studies involving these two berries some studies highlight the potential benefit of berries, especially of blueberry, on glucose metabolism in T2DM subjects. Daily cranberry juice (240 mL) consumption for 12 weeks and blueberry extract or powder supplementation (9.1 to 9.8 mg of anthocyanins, respectively) for 8 to 12 weeks showed a beneficial effect on glucose control in T2DM subjects. Those results indicate a promising use of these berries in T2DM management; although more studies are required to better understand the mechanisms involved.},

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception through September 10, 2017 for relevant full-text articles in English. Observational studies were selected if they examined the effects of early life PUFA or R-TFA on AD (eczema, asthma, wheeze, and allergic rhinitis) or sensitization. The quality of studies was examined by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the best evidence synthesis (BES) was applied. We included 26 observational studies, and 8 of them showed high quality. BES showed a moderate evidence for the protective effect of vaccenic acid (VA, an R-TFA) on eczema, while insufficient or no evidence was found in other associations. Meta-analysis showed that higher n-6/n-3 ratio and linoleic acid were associated with higher risk of eczema (pooled odds ratio [OR] = 1.06, 95\% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.00 -1.13; 1.08, 95\% CI: 1.01 -1.15). However, VA was inversely associated with eczema pooled OR = 0.42, 95\% CI: 0.25 -0.72). Early life natural exposure to VA showed evident benefit on decreasing the risk of eczema, while PUFA and other R-TFA showed limited effects on AD.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To analyse the association between dietary long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and incidence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in middle-aged and older women from the Swedish Mammography Cohort, a population-based prospective study.
METHODS: Data on diet were collected in 1987 and 1997 via a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The risk of RA associated with dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs and fish intake was estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression models, adjusted for age, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, use of aspirin and energy intake.
RESULTS: Among 32 232 women born 1914-1948, 205 RA cases were identified during a mean follow-up of 7.5 years (1 January 2003 to 31 December 2010; 2 41 120 person-years). An intake of dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs (FFQ1997) of more than 0.21 g/day (lowest quintile) was associated with a 35\% decreased risk of developing RA (multivariable adjusted relative risk (RR) 0.65; 95\% CI 0.48 to 0.90) compared with a lower intake. Long-term intake consistently higher than 0.21 g/day (according to both FFQ1987 and FFQ1997) was associated with a 52\% (95\% CI 29\% to 67\%) decreased risk. Consistent long-term consumption (FFQ1987 and FFQ1997) of fish ≥1 serving per week compared with{\textless}1 was associated with a 29\% decrease in risk (RR 0.71; 95\% CI 0.48 to 1.04).
CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study of women supports the hypothesis that dietary intake of long-chain n-3 PUFAs may play a role in aetiology of RA.},

The online databases of PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, Science Direct and Embase were searched until August 2017 for related publications using relevant keywords. To pool data, either a fixed-effects model or random-effects models were used. Cochran's Q tests were used to assess heterogeneity between studies. In total, 10 studies (7 prospective and 3 case-control studies) were included in this systematic review, and 9 studies with total sample size of 292657 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The age of participants was 20Â years or older. Combining 8 effect sizes from 4 prospective studies and 2 case-control studies revealed a significant inverse association between fish consumption and risk of hip fracture (pooled effect size: 0.88, 95\% CI: 0.79-0.98, P = 0.02). Although this relationship became non-significant in prospective studies, a significant inverse association was found in prospective studies with sample size of 10000 individuals or more, and studies that considered body mass index as a covariate. Furthermore, dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs was inversely associated with risk of hip fracture (pooled effect size: 0.89, 95\% CI: 0.80-0.99, P = 0.02).

We used the PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and Lilacs databases.

Four articles were selected, of which three tested the intake of 50 to 57 g of pistachio/day and one 20\% of the daily caloric intake, for a period of 1 to 4 months. Studies reported a decrease in fasting blood glucose, insulinemia, HOMA-IR, and fructosamine, but no change in HbA1c. Lower concentrations of miR-192 and miR-375 were also found, which correlated positively with HOMA-IR. The synergism between PUFA, MUFA, polyphenols and carotenoids present in pistachios can modulate specific miRNA, increasing insulin sensitivity through the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. This modulation can be used as a tool to monitor the response to interventions, favoring the prevention and treatment of complications related to diabetes.},

In a randomized, double-blind study, 26 (15 women, 11 men) adults between the ages of 20-35y (n = 15) and 64-86y (n = 11) completed 7 day periods of taking placebo and L-citrulline (6 g/day) in a crossover manner. Participants walked on a treadmill at 40\%HRR while pulmonary VO2 was measured using indirect calorimetry. Net oxygen cost, mean response time (MRT), and the oxygen deficit were calculated before and after each supplement period. There was no significant change (P{\textgreater}0.05) in net oxygen cost, MRT, or the oxygen deficit after Cit in older adults, while young adults showed a decrease (P=0.05) in the oxygen deficit after Cit that tended (P=0.053) to be different than the change after placebo. Sex-stratified analysis revealed that Cit decreased MRT (P=0.04, Cohen's d = 0.41) and the oxygen deficit (P{\textless}0.01, Cohen's d = 0.56) in men with the change after Cit being greater than the change after placebo (MRT: -4.5±2.1 vs. 3.4±2.1s, P=0.01; deficit: -0.15±0.05 vs. 0.01±0.05L, P=0.02). All VO2 parameters were unchanged (P{\textgreater}0.05) following Cit and placebo in women. Citrulline does not alter the oxygen cost of moderate intensity walking in young or older adults, but Cit improved the rate of rise in VO2 at exercise onset in men.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Earlier studies show that dietary bioactive compounds can modify proliferation of γδ-T cells. Garlic contains numerous compounds that have this potential and, in addition, has been shown to influence NK cell function. Our primary aim was to demonstrate that aged garlic extract could modify these immune cells.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel intervention study recruited 120 healthy subjects (60 per group) to determine the effect of aged garlic extract supplementation (2.56 g/d) on immune cell proliferation and cold and flu symptoms.
RESULTS: After 45 d of consuming an encapsulated aged garlic extract, γδ-T cells (p = 0.039, n = 56) and NK cells (p = 0.043, n = 56) were shown to proliferate better compared to placebo. After 90 d of supplementation, illness diary entries showed that the incidence of colds and flu, a secondary outcome, were not statistically different; however, the group consuming the aged garlic extract appeared to have reduced severity as noted by a reduction in the number of symptoms reported (21\% fewer, p {\textless} 0.001, z-test of proportions), a reduction in the number of days (61\% fewer, p {\textless} 0.001, z-test) and incidences (58\% fewer p {\textless} 0.001, z-test) where the subjects functioned sub-optimally and the number of work/school days missed due to illness (58\% fewer, p = 0.035, z-test).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that supplementation of the diet with aged garlic extract may enhance immune cell function and that this may be responsible, in part, for reduced severity of colds and flu.},

	abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease worldwide. In the absence of effective pharmacotherapies, clinical guidelines focus primarily on weight loss to treat this condition. Established consensus, evidence-based, and clinical dietary recommendations for NAFLD are currently lacking. The aim of this paper is to provide evidence-based practical dietary recommendations for the prevention and management of NAFLD in adults. A literature review focusing on established principles for the development of clinical practice recommendations was employed using the following criteria: based on substantial evidence, ensures risk minimization, is flexible for an individual patient approach, and is open to further modification as evidence emerges. The Practice-based Evidence in Nutrition classification system was used to grade these principles. Five key dietary recommendations were developed: 1) follow traditional dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet; 2) limit excess fructose consumption and avoid processed foods and beverages with added fructose; 3) PUFAs, especially long-chain omega-3 rich foods and MUFAs, should replace SFAs in the diet; 4) replace processed food, fast food, commercial bakery goods, and sweetsÂ with unprocessed foods high in fiber, including whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and seeds; and 5) avoid excess alcohol consumption. Improving diet quality may reduce the incidence and progression of NAFLD and associated risk factors. Many of the benefits are likely to result from the collective effect of dietary patterns. High-quality research-in particular, randomized clinical trials assessing dietary interventions that focus on liver-specific endpoints-are needed as a priority.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Cell viability (CCK8 assay), flow cytometry, Hoechst 33258 staining, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blotting were used. EGCG prevented Aβ1-42-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, increased cell viability, and decreased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In a subsequent mechanism study, it was found that this effect contributed to the down-regulation of GRP78, CHOP, cleaved-caspase-12 and -3. Moreover, EGCG also reduced the cytotoxicity induced by tunicamycin (TM) and thapsigargin (TG), two ER stress activators. Consistent with the in vitro study, EGCG inhibited neuronal apoptosis in the cortex of APP/PS1 transgenic mice, with the mitigation of ER abnormal ultrastructural swelling and the downregulation of ER-stress-associated proteins.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that EGCG attenuates the neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) via a novel mechanism that involves inhibition of ER-stress-associated neuronal apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, suggesting the tremendous potential of EGCG for use in a nutritional preventive strategy against AD.},

Little is known, however, regarding the behavioral consequences of modified diet constituents and the propensity to development of stress related disorders. Thus, the aim of this study was to verify whether chronic exposure to a normocaloric/high-carbohydrate diet will modify the animal's behavior after different stressful stimuli.
METHODS: BALB/c mice were fed for 12 weeks with a standard chow diet or high refined carbohydrate-containing diet (HC). Following this period, independent groups of animals were exposed to different stress paradigms: 1 - two hours of restraint stress followed by exposure to the Elevated Plus Maze test (EPM) 24 hours later; 2 - The contextual fear conditioning (CFC) test and 3 - the tail suspension test (TST).
RESULTS: Despite no change on total body weight, animals fed with HC diet showed increase in serum leptin levels and higher adiposity compared to diet control group. In behavioral tests, animals from HC diet group displayed reduction in the percentage of entries into the open arms of the EPM, evaluated 24 hours after restraint stress, suggesting an anxiogenic-like effect. It is also observed increase in aversive memory in the CFC test and depressive-like behavior in TST.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that a moderate obesity, induced by high refined carbohydrate diet, may facilitate the development of anxiety and depressive-like behaviors after the stress. The mechanisms responsible for such effects remain to be elucidated.},

	abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is one of the best known marine toxins, causative of important neurotoxic alterations. DA effects are documented both in wildlife and experimental assays, showing that this toxin causes severe injuries principally in the hippocampal area. Accumulating evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are involved in DA-induced cognitive functional impairment. Therefore, therapeutics targeted to improve mitochondrial function and increase oxidative stress defence could be beneﬁcial. Quercetin, a bioﬂavanoid, has been reported to have potent neuroprotective effects and anti-oxidative ability, but its preventive effects on DA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment have not been well characterised. In this study, we evaluated the effects of quercetin on DA-induced cognitive deficits in mice and explored its potential mechanism. Our results showed that the oral administration of quercetin to DA-treated mice significantly improved their behavioural performance in a novel objective recognition task and a Morris water maze task. These improvements were mediated, at least in part, by a stimulation of PPARγ coactivator 1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis signalling and an amelioration of mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, quercetin activated nuclear factorerythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2)-mediated phase II enzymes and decreased reactive oxygen species and protein carbonylation. Furthermore, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity significantly increased in the quercetin-treated group. Taken together, these findings suggest that a reduction in mitochondrial dysfunction through the increase of AMPK activity, coupled with an increase in Nrf2 pathway mediated oxidative defence, may be one of the mechanisms by which quercetin improves cognitive impairment induced by DA in mice.},

Consuming walnuts has been associated with health benefits including a reduced risk of heart disease and cancer. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been linked to several chronic diseases. One potential mechanism by which walnuts may exert their health benefit is through modifying the gut microbiome. This study identified the changes in the gut microbial communities that occur following the inclusion of walnuts in the diet. Male Fischer 344 rats (n=20) were randomly assigned to one of two diets for as long as 10 weeks: (1) walnut (W), and (2) replacement (R) in which the fat, fiber, and protein in walnuts were matched with corn oil, protein casein, and a cellulose fiber source. Intestinal samples were collected from the descending colon, the DNA isolated, and the V3-V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene deep sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq for characterization of the gut microbiota. Body weight and food intake did not differ significantly between the two diet groups. The diet groups had distinct microbial communities with animals consuming walnuts displaying significantly greater species diversity. Walnuts increased the abundance of Firmicutes and reduced the abundance of Bacteriodetes. Walnuts enriched the microbiota for probiotic-type bacteria including Lactobacillus, Ruminococcaceae, and Roseburia while significantly reducing Bacteroides and Anaerotruncus. The class Alphaproteobacteria was also reduced. Walnut consumption altered the gut microbial community suggesting a new mechanism by which walnuts may confer their beneficial health effects.},

METHODS: A total of 23 099 men and 35 597 women ages 40 to 79 y participated in the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study and completed a food frequency questionnaire from which dietary intakes of vitamins A, K, E, and D were calculated. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the sex-specific risks of heart failure mortality according to increasing quintiles of fat-soluble vitamin intakes.
RESULTS: During the median 19.3 y follow-up period, there were 567 deaths from heart failure (240 men, 327 women). Dietary vitamin A intake showed no association with heart failure mortality in both sexes; however, the reduced risk was observed in women but not in men with dietary intakes of vitamins K, E, and D. The multivariable hazard ratios (95\% confidence interval) in the highest versus the lowest intake quintiles among women were 0.63 (0.45-0.87; P for trend = 0.006) for vitamin K, 0.55 (0.36-0.78; P for trend = 0.006) for vitamin E, and 0.66 (0.48-0.93; P for trend = 0.01) for vitamin D. The association for each vitamin was slightly attenuated but remained statistically significant after mutual adjustment for intakes of the other vitamins.

Epidemiologic studies evaluating the risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs; i.e., stroke, acute myocardial infarction [MI], heart failure, coronary heart disease) were included according to different rates of chocolate intake. The software ProMeta 3 was used to perform the meta-analysis. The systematic review identified 16 eligible studies. The majority of the studies showed a protective effect of chocolate intake compared with unexposed individuals. The overall risk ratio (effect size [ES]) of CVD for the highest versus the lowest category of chocolate consumption was 0.77 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.84; P = 0.000) with a moderate heterogeneity. The risk related to subgroups of CVD and in particular, the risk for MI was further analyzed: ES = 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.64-0.94; P = 0.009) without statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 46.56\%; P = 0.13).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Exercise activates muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), but moderate intensity exercise fails to fully activate muscle PDC after high-fat diet [1]. We investigated whether maximal intensity exercise overcomes this inhibition.
METHODS: Quadriceps femoris muscle biopsy samples were obtained from healthy males at rest, and after 46 and 92 electrically-evoked maximal intermittent isometric contractions, which were preceded by 3 days of either low- (18\%) or high- (69\%) isocaloric dietary fat intake (LFD and HFD, respectively).
RESULTS: The ratio of PDCa (active form) to total PDCt (fully activated) at rest was 50\% less after HFD (0.32 ± 0.01 vs 0.15 ± 0.01; P {\textless} 0.05). This ratio increased to 0.77 ± 0.06 after 46 contractions (P {\textless} 0.001) and to 0.98 ± 0.07 after 92 contractions (P {\textless} 0.001) in LFD. The corresponding values after HFD were less (0.54 ± 0.06; P {\textless} 0.01 and 0.70 ± 0.07; P {\textless} 0.01, respectively). Resting muscle acetyl-CoA and acetylcarnitine content was greater after HFD than LFD (both P {\textless} 0.05), but their rate of accumulation in the former was reduced during contraction. Muscle lactate content after 92 contractions was 30\% greater after HFD (P {\textless} 0.05). Muscle force generation during contraction was no different between interventions, but HFD lengthened muscle relaxation time (P {\textless} 0.05). Daily urinary total carnitine excretion after HFD was 2.5-fold greater than after LFD (P {\textless} 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: A bout of maximal intense exercise did not overcome dietary fat-mediated inhibition of muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activation, and was associated with greater muscle lactate accumulation, as a result of lower PDC flux, and increased muscle relaxation time.},

Thus, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of exercise and taurine supplementation on peripheral markers of blood-brain barrier, inflammation, and cognition of elderly women. Forty-eight elderly women (83.58±6.9 years) participated in the study, and were allocated into combined exercise training (CET: n=13), taurine supplementation (TAU: n=12), exercise training associated with taurine (CET+TAU: n=11), or control group (CG: n=12). Exercise was applied twice a week (multi-modal exercise). Taurine ingestion was 1.5g., once a day. Participants were evaluated before and after 14-weeks of intervention. Plasma levels of IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α, and serum concentration of S100β and neuron specific enolase (NSE) were determined. The mini mental state examination (MMSE) was also applied. Concentrations of S100β were maintained in all intervention groups, while a subtle increase in the CG was found.

We developed an animal model presenting similar perinatal brain damage by combining bacterial endotoxin and H/I insults. Interleukin (IL)-1beta is a mediator of brain damage and its action(s) is counteracted by its cognate anti-inflammatory IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). We tested the hypothesis that the balance between agonist and antagonist in the IL-1 system is shifted towards inflammation in perinatal brains exposed to endotoxin and/or H/I. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or H/I enhanced both intracerebral IL-1beta mRNA and protein levels, with a maximum increase observed with combined LPS and H/I insults. Conversely, IL-1ra expression was significantly downregulated by LPS, H/I, or both combined, with a maximum magnitude of imbalance between IL-1beta and sIL-1ra noticed with the double hit. The nuclear factor (NF)kappaB component of the signaling pathway activated by IL-1beta-binding to its receptor was activated following exposure to LPS and/or H/I. We show for the first time that, perinatally, bacterial products, H/I, or both combined, induce downregulation in sIL-1ra expression concomitant with upregulation in IL-1beta. The resulting pro-inflammatory orientation in the IL-1/IL-1ra balance might play a role in the initiation of perinatal brain damages.},

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of a high-ALA diet on EPA and DHA levels in red blood cells (RBCs) and their oxylipins in the plasma of subjects with a low EPA and DHA status. Fatty acid concentrations [μg mL-1] and relative amounts [\% of total fatty acids] in the RBCs of 19 healthy men (mean age 26.4 ± 4.6 years) were analyzed by means of GC-FID. Free plasma oxylipin concentrations were determined by LC-MS based targeted metabolomics. Samples were collected and analyzed at baseline (week 0) and after 1 (week 1), 3 (week 3), 6 (week 6), and 12 (week 12) weeks of high dietary ALA intake (14.0 ± 0.45 g day-1). ALA concentrations significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) increased from 1.44 ± 0.10 (week 0) to 4.65 ± 0.22 (week 1), 5.47 ± 0.23 (week 3), 6.25 ± 0.24 (week 6), and 5.80 ± 0.28 (week 12) μg mL-1. EPA concentrations increased from 6.13 ± 0.51 (week 0) to 7.33 ± 0.33 (week 1), 8.38 ± 0.42 (p = 0.021, week 3), 10.9 ± 0.67 (p {\textless} 0.001, week 6), and 11.0 ± 0.64 (p {\textless} 0.001, week 12) μg mL-1. DHA concentrations unexpectedly decreased from 41.0 ± 1.93 (week 0) to 37.0 ± 1.32 (week 1), 36.1 ± 1.37 (week 3), 35.1 ± 1.06 (p = 0.010, week 6), and 30.4 ± 1.09 (p {\textless} 0.001, week 12) μg mL-1. Relative ΣEPA + DHA amounts were unchanged during the intervention (week 0: 4.63 ± 0.19, week 1: 4.67 ± 0.16, week 3: 4.61 ± 0.13, week 6: 4.73 ± 0.15, week 12: 4.52 ± 0.11). ALA- and EPA-derived hydroxy- and dihydroxy-PUFA increased similarly to their PUFA precursors, although in the case of ALA-derived oxylipins, the concentrations increased less rapidly and to a lesser extent compared to the concentrations of their precursor FA. LA-derived oxylipins remained unchanged and arachidonic acid and DHA oxylipin concentrations were not significantly changed. Our results confirm that the intake of ALA is not a sufficient source for the increase of EPA + DHA in subjects on a Western diet. Specifically, a high-ALA diet results in increased EPA and declined DHA concentrations. However, the changes effectively balance each other out so that ΣEPA + DHA in RBCs - which is an established marker for health protective effects of omega-3-PUFA - remains constant. The PUFA levels in RBCs reflect the concentration and its changes in plasma hydroxy- and dihydroxy-PUFA concentrations for ALA and EPA.},

To date, CGN is generally recognized as safe based on a history of safe use, various acute toxicology studies and some recent chronic toxicology tests. This review offers readers an overview of evidence on CGN characteristics and digestive fate that highlight various gaps in our understanding. Specifically, three unresolved gaps are identified. Firstly, little information can be found on the current levels of public exposure to CGN. Secondly, the link between CGN physicochemical properties, its impact on digestive proteolysis, the colon microbiome and inflammation are yet to be fully resolved. Thirdly, scant scientific evidence exists on the differential digestive fate of CGN in the gut of liable and predisposed populations, such as elderly people or IBD patients. Altogether, revisiting the scientific evidence indicates that more research is needed to elucidate the possibility that continued exposure to increasing levels of CGN in the human diet may compromise human health and well-being.},

	abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to analyze the response of selected components of the immune system in rowers to maximal physical exercise, and to verify if this response can be modulated by supplementation with spirulina (cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis).
Method: The double-blind study included 19 members of the Polish Rowing Team. The subjects were randomly assigned to the supplemented group (n = 10), receiving 1500 mg of spirulina extract for 6 weeks, or to the placebo group (n = 9). The participants performed a 2000-m test on a rowing ergometer at the beginning (1st examination) and at the end of the supplementation period (2nd examination). Blood samples were obtained from the antecubital vein prior to each exercise test, 1 min after completing the test, and after a 24-h recovery period. Subpopulations of T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs) [CD4+/CD25+/CD127-], cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) [CD8+/TCRαβ+], natural killer (NK) cells [CD3-/CD16+/CD56+] and TCRδγ-positive (Tδγ) cells were determined by means of flow cytometry.
Results: On the 2nd examination, athletes from the supplemented group showed neither a post-exercise increase in Treg count nor a post-recovery decrease in Tδγ cell count (both observed in the placebo group), and presented with significantly lower values of Treg/CTL prior to and after the exercise. During the same examination, rowers from the placebo group showed a significant post-recovery increase in Treg/(NK + Tδγ + CTL) ratio, which was absent in the supplemented group.
Conclusion: The results of this study imply that supplementation with spirulina extract may protect athletes against a deficit in immune function (especially, anti-infectious function) associated with strenuous exercise, and may cause a beneficial shift in "overtraining threshold" preventing a radical deterioration of immunity.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.clnu.2018.01.013},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Histamine intolerance is a disorder in the homeostasis of histamine due to a reduced intestinal degradation of this amine, mainly caused by a deficiency in the enzyme diamine oxidase (DAO). Among histamine related symptoms, headache is one of the most recorded. Current clinical strategies for the treatment of the symptomatology related to this disorder are based on the exclusion of foods with histamine or other bioactive amines and/or exogenous DAO supplementation. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a food supplement consisting of DAO enzyme as a preventive treatment of migraine in patients with DAO deficiency through a randomized double-blind trial.
METHODS: 100 patients with confirmed episodic migraine according to current International Headache Society (IHS) criteria and DAO deficiency (levels below 80 HDU/ml) were randomized in two groups. One group received DAO enzyme supplementation and the other received placebo for one month. Clinical outcomes assessed were duration and number of attacks, perception of pain intensity and adverse effects during treatment. The use of triptans was also recorded.
RESULTS: Great variability was found in the duration of migraine attacks reported by placebo and DAO groups. A significant reduction (p = 0.0217) in hours of pain was achieved in patients treated with DAO supplement, with mean durations of 6.14 (±3.06) and 4.76 (±2.68) hours before and after treatment, respectively. A smaller reduction without statistical signification was also observed for this outcome in the placebo group, from 7.53 (±4.24) to 6.68 (±4.42) hours. Only in DAO group, a decrease in the percentage of patients taking triptans was observed. The number of attacks and the scores of pain intensity showed a similar reduction in both groups. No adverse effects were registered in patients treated with DAO enzyme.
CONCLUSIONS: Migrainous patients supplemented with DAO enzyme during one month significantly reduced the duration of their migraine attacks by 1.4 h. No statistically significant reduction was found in placebo group before and after treatment. The reduction of pain hours observed in placebo group (0.9 h) could explain the lack of significant differences between both study groups. One month of DAO supplementation has demonstrated a positive trend in the improvement of migraine but more studies with a longer treatment period are needed to better assess the efficacy of DAO supplementation.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the prospective associations between consumption of ultra-processed food and risk of cancer.
DESIGN: Population based cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 104 980 participants aged at least 18 years (median age 42.8 years) from the French NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-17). Dietary intakes were collected using repeated 24 hour dietary records, designed to register participants' usual consumption for 3300 different food items. These were categorised according to their degree of processing by the NOVA classification.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Associations between ultra-processed food intake and risk of overall, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer assessed by multivariable Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for known risk factors.
RESULTS: Ultra-processed food intake was associated with higher overall cancer risk (n=2228 cases; hazard ratio for a 10\% increment in the proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet 1.12 (95\% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.18); P for trend{\textless}0.001) and breast cancer risk (n=739 cases; hazard ratio 1.11 (1.02 to 1.22); P for trend=0.02). These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for several markers of the nutritional quality of the diet (lipid, sodium, and carbohydrate intakes and/or a Western pattern derived by principal component analysis).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective study, a 10\% increase in the proportion of ultra-processed foods in the diet was associated with a significant increase of greater than 10\% in risks of overall and breast cancer. Further studies are needed to better understand the relative effect of the various dimensions of processing (nutritional composition, food additives, contact materials, and neoformed contaminants) in these associations.

However, limited bioavailability and inability to detect curcumin in circulation or target tissues has hindered the validation of a causal role. We established curcumin-mediated decrease in the release of gut bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into circulation by maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier function as the mechanism underlying the attenuation of metabolic diseases (diabetes, atherosclerosis, kidney disease) by curcumin supplementation precluding the need for curcumin absorption. In view of the causative role of circulating LPS and resulting chronic inflammation in the development of diseases listed above, this review summarizes the mechanism by which curcumin affects the several layers of the intestinal barrier and, despite negligible absorption, can beneficially modulate these diseases.},

Therefore, the glycaemic responses elicited by one serving (27 g) instant-oatmeal plus 247 g 2\% milk (IO, 28 g available-carbohydrate, 1.2 g β-glucan) or IO plus 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 or 1.6 g oat β-glucan (OBG) from oat-bran, or an available-carbohydrate matched portion of cream of rice (CR) plus milk were measured over 2 h in n = 40 subjects using a randomized, cross-over design. The primary endpoint was incremental area under the curve (iAUC). The secondary endpoint was glucose peak-rise. The results showed that grams OBG consumed were significantly correlated with mean iAUC (p = 0.009) and with mean glucose peak-rise (p = 0.002). Each gram of OBG reduced iAUC by 7\% and peak-rise by 15\%. Thus, to achieve a ≥20\% reduction in iAUC relative to CR, 1.6 g OBG had to be added to IO (74 ± 7 vs. 93 ± 6 mmol min L-1, p {\textless} 0.05), but, to achieve a 20\% reduction in peak-rise, only 0.4 g OBG was required (2.00 ± 0.1 vs. 2.40 ± 0.1 mmol, p {\textless} 0.05). We conclude that adding OBG to IO flattened postprandial glycaemic responses in a dose-dependent fashion; 1.6 g OBG was required to reduce iAUC by ≥20\% versus CR, but a 20\% reduction in peak-rise required only 0.4 g. The greater effect of OGB on peak-rise than iAUC presumably reflects the way viscous dietary fibres modulate glucose absorption kinetics.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00508-018-1328-x},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin K2 (VK2) belongs to the vitamin K family and comprises a number of subtypes differing in length of side chains consisting of isoprenoid groups (menaquinone-n, MK-n). It is essential for a number of physiological functions although the full spectrum of activity has not yet been elucidated. Due to its role in protection of mitochondrial damage, VK2 could be relevant in preventing disease progress in multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: We measured VK2 serum levels by the double antibody sandwich Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) technique in MS patients and age and sex matched controls, both under vitamin D supplementation, and related it to disease characteristics and treatment.
RESULTS: Overall, 45 MS patients (31 females and 39 of the relapsing-remitting type) and 29 healthy controls (19 females) were included in the analysis. The MS patients had vastly lower VK2 blood levels than controls (235 ± 100 ng/ml vs. 812 ± 154 ng/ml, respectively). Female patients had significantly lower VK2 levels than males and a decrease with age by approximately 10\% per decade was found. The VK2 levels were lower with increasing numbers of attacks per year and were higher in patients with optic nerve lesions. No consistent relationship with medications was detected.
CONCLUSION: The substantially lower levels of VK2 in MS patients could be due to depletion, lower production in the gut, diminished absorption or, less likely, reduced intake of precursor vitamin K1. The role of VK2 in MS development and progress deserves further study.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the effects of green tea extract on working memory in healthy younger (21 - 29 y) and older (50 - 63 y) women.
DESIGN: A single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design was used.
SETTING: A university laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty non-smoking Caucasian women were recruited in the younger (10) and older (10) age group.
INTERVENTION: Subjects received 5.4 g green tea extract (at least 45\% epigallocatechin-3-gallate) or placebo (cornstarch) within a 24-hour period.
MEASUREMENTS: Working memory was measured by reading span and N-back task paradigm. Blood sample (20 mL) was collected and measured for plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TEAC) concentration. A 24-hour recall was conducted for each treatment period to ensure similar dietary patterns.
RESULTS: Green tea extract significantly improved reading span performance in older women, indicated by higher absolute and partial scores of reading span. No significant changes were observed in the younger group. N-back latencies and accuracies were not significantly different after green tea treatment in either age group. Plasma concentration of MDA and TEAC were not different after green tea extract in either group.
CONCLUSION: Acute supplementation of decaffeinated green tea extract may enhance working memory capacity of women between 50 to 63 years of age. This study provides preliminary evidence that consumption of green tea extract may enhance the cognitive performance in older adults and thus provide potential chemopreventive benefits in this group. The mechanism should be explored in future research.},

METHODS: Four hundred and fifty subjects at different risk levels for thrombosis, flying in economy class twice a week for more than 8 hours, were included; 295 completed the registry study and were subdivided in 3 groups according to their risk level - low, moderate, or high. The high-risk group also received Aspirin®. A standard management (SM) was used in all groups. In each risk category, three groups were made according to patient management: a Pycnogenol group, a SM group (control), and a stockings group. The groups were comparable at inclusion. No side effects were observed.
RESULTS: In the low risk group edema were reduced more (P{\textless}0.05) with Pycnogenol and stockings compared to control. Ankle circumference was smaller with Pycnogenol (P{\textless}0.05). No thrombosis was detected. D-dimer was negative in Pycnogenol subjects; one subject in the control group had increased values, as did two of the 36 subjects in the stockings group. In the group with moderate risk, edema and ankle circumference were lower in the Pycnogenol group (P{\textless}0.05). One deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and one minimal superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) were seen in controls. D-dimer was normal in the Pycnogenol group. In high-risk subjects, edema, and ankle circumference were significantly reduced in the Pycnogenol group (P{\textless}0.05). There were no SVT or DVT in the Pycnogenol group. One minimal DVT and one SVT were observed in controls. D-dimer was negative in all Pycnogenol subjects (P{\textless}0.05); three post-flight values increased in controls and in four of the 32 subjects in the stockings group. The jet lag score was lower in low-, medium-, and high-risk Pycnogenol subjects (P{\textless}0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This registry study indicates that Pycnogenol supplementation reduces edema and may control some thrombotic events.},

Results indicated that cocoa flavanols improved visual search efficiency, reflected by reduced reaction time. However, cocoa flavanols did not facilitate temporal attention nor integration, suggesting that flavanols may affect some aspects of attention, but not others.

It is a redox sensitive protein with the key Cys in its active site. Recently, it has been documented that activity of some proteins can be modified by sulfur-containing molecules called reactive sulfur species leading to the formation of hydro- persulfides. The aim of the present study was to examine whether ALDH activity can be modified in this way. Studies were performed in vitro using yeast ALDH and various reactive sulfur species, including Na2S, GSSH, K2Sx, Na2S2O3, and garlic-derived allyl sulfides. The effect of garlic-derived trisulfide on ALDH activity was also studied in vivo in the rat liver. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that ALDH could be regulated by sulfur species which inhibited its enzymatic activity. The results also suggested that not H2S but polysulfides or hydropersulfides were the oxidizing species responsible for this modification. This process was easily reversible by reducing agents. After the treatment with polysulfides or hydropersulfides the level of protein-bound sulfur increased, while the activity of the enzyme dramatically decreased. Moreover, the study demonstrated that ALDH activity was inhibited in vivo in the rat liver after garlic-derived trisulfide administration. This is the first study reporting the regulation of ALDH activity by sulfane sulfur species and the results suggest that it leads to the inhibition of the enzyme.},

In total, thirty-six healthy males (mean age 17 (sd 1) years) were randomly selected and divided into four groups of supplementation, supplementation with pre-cooling, pre-cooling and control. During an eighteen-session protocol in the morning and evening, subjects attended speed and endurance swimming training sessions for 5 km in each session. Blood sampling was done before (two stages) and after (two stages) administration of CoQ10 and pre-cooling. ANCOVA and repeated measurement tests with Bonferroni post hoc test were used for the statistical analysis of the data. There was no significant statistical difference among groups for the levels of CK-MB, cTnI, Mb, LD, TAC, LPO and CoQ10 at the presampling (stages 1 and 2) (P{\textgreater}0·05). However, pre-cooling and control groups show a significant increase in the levels of CK-MB, cTnI, Mb, LD and LPO compared with the supplementation and supplementation with pre-cooling groups in the post-sampling (stages 1 and 2) (P{\textless}0·05), except for the TAC and CoQ10. Consequently, CoQ10 supplementation prevents adverse changes of myocardial damage and oxidative stress during swimming competition phase. Meanwhile, the pre-cooling strategy individually has no desired effect on the levels of CK-MB, cTnI, Mb, LD, LPO, TAC and CoQ10.},

After each supplementation period, participants underwent tasks inducing mental and physical fatigue (visual display terminal task and ergometer task, respectively). Subjective fatigue was evaluated using a visual analogue scale during and after the mental and physical tasks, and daily subjective fatigue was evaluated by the Chalder fatigue questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included other subjective feelings, work efficiency, autonomic nerve activity, levels of an oxidative stress marker (plasma phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PCOOH)) and safety. AS supplementation was associated with significantly improved recovery from mental fatigue compared with placebo. Increased PCOOH levels during mental and physical tasks were attenuated by AS supplementation. No differences between AS and placebo were detected in secondary outcomes, and no adverse effects of AS supplementation were observed. In conclusion, AS supplementation may be a candidate to promote recovery from mental fatigue which is experienced by many healthy people.},

Recently, we showed that leucine has antiatherogenic properties in the macrophage model system. In this study, an in-depth investigation of the role of leucine in macrophage lipid metabolism was conducted by supplementing humans, mice, or cultured macrophages with leucine. Macrophage incubation with serum obtained from healthy adults supplemented with leucine (5 g/d, 3 weeks) significantly decreased cellular cholesterol mass by inhibiting the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis and increasing cholesterol efflux from macrophages. Similarly, leucine supplementation to C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks) resulted in decreased cholesterol content in their harvested peritoneal macrophages (MPM) in relation with reduced cholesterol biosynthesis rate. Studies in J774A.1 murine macrophages revealed that leucine dose-dependently decreased cellular cholesterol and triglyceride mass. Macrophages treated with leucine (0.2 mM) showed attenuated uptake of very low-density lipoproteins and triglyceride biosynthesis rate, with a concurrent down-regulation of diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1, a key enzyme catalyzing triglyceride biosynthesis in macrophages. Similar effects were observed when macrophages were treated with α-ketoisocaproate, a key leucine metabolite. Finally, both in vivo and in vitro leucine supplementation significantly improved macrophage mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. The above studies, conducted in human, mice, and cultured macrophages, highlight a protective role for leucine attenuating macrophage foam-cell formation by mechanisms related to the metabolism of cholesterol, triglycerides, and energy production. © 2018 BioFactors, 2018.},

	abstract = {Restaurant prepared foods are known to be energy-dense and high in fat and sodium, but lower in protective nutrients. There is evidence of higher risk of adiposity, type II diabetes, and heart disease in frequent consumers of restaurant meals. However, the risk of mortality as a long-term health consequence of frequent consumption of restaurant meals has not been examined. We examined the prospective risk of all-cause and coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and diabetes (cardiometabolic) mortality in relation to frequency of eating restaurant prepared meals in a national cohort. We used frequency of eating restaurant prepared meals information collected in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, conducted from 1999-2004, with mortality follow-up completed through Dec. 31, 2011 (baseline age ≥ 40y; n = 9107). We estimated the relative hazard of all-cause and cardiometabolic mortality associated with weekly frequency of eating restaurant meals using Cox-proportional hazards regression methods to adjust for multiple covariates. All analyses accounted for complex survey design and included sample weights. Over 33\% of all respondents reported eating ≥3 restaurant prepared meals/week. In this cohort, 2200 deaths due to all causes and 665 cardiometabolic deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 9 years. The covariate-adjusted hazard ratio of all cause or cardiometabolic mortality in men and women reporters of {\textless}1 or 1-2 restaurant prepared meals did not differ from those reporting ≥3 meals/week (P{\textgreater}0.05). The results were robust to effect modification by baseline BMI, years of education, and baseline morbidity. Expectedly, the 24-h dietary intakes of whole grains, fruits, dietary fiber, folate, vitamin C, potassium and magnesium at baseline were lower, but energy, energy density, and energy from fat were higher in more frequent restaurant meal reporters (P{\textless}0.05). Baseline serum HDL cholesterol, folate, and some carotenoids were inversely associated with the frequency of eating restaurant prepared meals (P{\textless}0.05); however, serum concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin, and c-reactive protein were unrelated (P{\textless}0.05). The weekly frequency of eating restaurant prepared meals and prospective risk of mortality after 9 years were not related in this cohort.},

Contrary to our hypothesis, aerobic and resistance exercise coupled with RSV treatment did not reduce cardiovascular risk further than exercise alone. However, exercise added to RSV treatment improved the indices of mitochondrial density, and muscle fatigue resistance more than placebo and exercise treatments. In addition, subjects that were treated with RSV had an increase in knee extensor muscle peak torque (8\%), average peak torque (14\%), and power (14\%) after training, whereas exercise did not increase these parameters in the placebo-treated older subjects. Furthermore, exercise combined with RSV significantly improved mean fiber area and total myonuclei by 45.3\% and 20\%, respectively, in muscle fibers from the vastus lateralis of older subjects. Together, these data indicate a novel anabolic role of RSV in exercise-induced adaptations of older persons and this suggests that RSV combined with exercise might provide a better approach for reversing sarcopenia than exercise alone.},

	abstract = {Balanced vegetarian diets are popular, although they are nearly absent in creatine and carnosine and contain considerably less carnitine than non-vegetarian diets. Few longitudinal intervention studies investigating the effect of a vegetarian diet on the availability of these compounds currently exist. We aimed to investigate the effect of transiently switching omnivores onto a vegetarian diet for 6 months on muscle and plasma creatine, carnitine and carnosine homeostasis. In a 6-month intervention, forty omnivorous women were ascribed to three groups: continued omnivorous diet (control, n 10), vegetarian diet without supplementation (Veg+Pla, n 15) and vegetarian diet combined with daily β-alanine (0·8-0·4 g/d) and creatine supplementation (1 g creatine monohydrate/d) (Veg+Suppl, n 15). Before (0 months; 0M), after 3 months (3M) and 6 months (6M), a fasted venous blood sample and 24-h urine was collected, and muscle carnosine content was determined by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Muscle biopsies were obtained at 0M and 3M. Plasma creatine and muscle total creatine content declined from 0M to 3M in Veg+Pla (P=0·013 and P=0·009, respectively), whereas plasma creatine increased from 0M in Veg+Suppl (P=0·004). None of the carnitine-related compounds in plasma or muscle showed a significant time×group interaction effect. 1H-MRS-determined muscle carnosine content was unchanged over 6M in control and Veg+Pla, but increased in Veg+Suppl in soleus (P{\textless}0·001) and gastrocnemius (P=0·001) muscle. To conclude, the body creatine pool declined over a 3-month vegetarian diet in omnivorous women, which was ameliorated when accompanied by low-dose dietary creatine supplementation. Carnitine and carnosine homeostasis was unaffected by a 3- or 6-month vegetarian diet, respectively.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Extra virgin olive oil lowers postprandial glycaemia. We investigated if oleuropein, a component of extra virgin olive oil, exerts a similar effect on postprandial glycaemia and the underlying mechanism.
METHODS: Twenty healthy subjects were randomly allocated in a cross-over design to 20 mg oleuropein or placebo immediately before lunch. Postprandial glycaemia along with blood insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and glucagon-like peptide-1 and oxidative stress, which included soluble NADPH oxidase-derived peptide activity (sNox2-dp), 8-iso-prostaglandin-2α and platelet p47phox phosphorylation, were analysed before and 2 h after meal.
RESULTS: After 2 h, subjects who assumed oleuropein had significantly lower blood glucose, DPP-4 activity and higher insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 compared to placebo. Furthermore, sNox2-dp, 8-iso-PGF2α and platelet p47phox phosphorylation were significantly lower in oleuropein- compared to placebo-treated subjects. DPP-4 significantly correlated with sNox2-dp [Spearman's rho (Rs) = 0.615; P {\textless} 0.001], p47phox phosphorylation (Rs = 0.435; P {\textless} 0.05) and 8-iso- prostaglandin-2α (Rs = 0.33; P {\textless} 0.05). In vitro study demonstrated that hydroxytyrosol, a metabolite of oleuropein, significantly reduced p47phox phosphorylation and isoprostane formation.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that oleuropein improves postprandial glycaemic profile via hampering Nox2-derived oxidative stress.},

The "NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing-3" (NLRP3) inflammasome component of innate immunity is a metabolic stress sensor modulated by dietary and genetics factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the consumption of two diets for 3 years, Mediterranean (Med) and low fat, on glucose homeostasis in the 1002 coronary heart disease patients of the CORDIOPREV study, according to a genetic variant of NLRP3 inflammasome.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was conducted in the framework of the CORDIOPREV study, a randomized dietary intervention with Med and low-fat diets. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located at inflammasome NLRP3 gene were genotyped by OpenArray platform. Nondiabetic CT+TT carriers of the rs4612666 SNP and AG+AA carriers of the rs10733113 SNP increased insulin sensitivity index (ISI) after 3 years of dietary intervention, whereas no effect was observed in diabetic patients. Further analysis by diet showed that the improvement of the ISI in nondiabetic rs10733113 AG+AA carriers was specific to the consumption of the Med diet.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that the benefits associated with a Med diet regarding glucose homeostasis in non-T2DM patients depend on genetic variation in the inflammasome.},

	abstract = {Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world and contains numerous phytochemicals that are beneficial to consumer health. The phytochemical profile of coffee, however, can be affected by the roast level. In this study, we compared the effect of roasting level on the growth inhibitory activity of HT-29 (colon) and SCC-25 (oral) cancer cell lines. The different roasting stages selected for this study were green, cinnamon/blonde, city/medium, full city/medium-dark, and full city plus/dark. Cancer cells were treated with various concentrations of coffee extracts for 72 hr. Cell viability was quantified using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay. It was found that the lighter roast extracts, Cinnamon in particular, reduced cell growth more than darker roast extracts. The Cinnamon extract had the greatest amount of total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Relative levels of gallic, caffeic, and chlorogenic acid in the extracts were also compared. The Cinnamon coffee extract had the highest levels of gallic and caffeic acids, which have both been widely-regarded as bioactive phytochemicals. In conclusion, the consumption of lighter roasted coffee, may contribute to the prevention of certain types of cancer such as oral and colon.
PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Chemical compounds in coffee may reduce the risk for certain types of cancers. These compounds may be particularly abundant in lighter roasted coffee. Therefore, lighter roasted coffee could contribute to the prevention of cancer through a healthy diet.},

However, effects on the level of spontaneous DNA strand breaks, a well established marker of health risk, have not been specifically reported yet. We analyzed the impact of consuming a dark roast coffee blend on the level of spontaneous DNA strand breaks.MethodsHealthy men (n = 84) were randomized to consume daily for 4 weeks either 750 ml of fresh coffee brew or 750 ml of water, subsequent to a run in washout phase of 4 weeks. The study coffee was a blend providing high amounts of both caffeoylquinic acids (10.18 ± 0.33 mg/g) and the roast product N-methylpyridinium (1.10 ± 0.05 mg/g). Before and after the coffee/water consumption phase, spontaneous strand breaks were determined by comet assay.ResultsAt baseline, both groups exhibited a similar level of spontaneous DNA strand breaks. In the intervention phase, spontaneous DNA strand breaks slightly increased in the control (water only) group whereas they significantly decreased in the coffee group, leading to a 27 \% difference within both arms (p = 0.0002). Food frequency questionnaires indicated no differences in the overall diet between groups, and mean body weight during the intervention phases remained stable. The consumption of the study coffee substantially lowered the level of spontaneous DNA strand breaks in WBC.ConclusionWe conclude that regular coffee consumption contributes to DNA integrity.},

By contrast, cardiac function did not improve with NAC alone. Both diet supplementations decreased cardiac levels of inflammatory mediators; only NAC+Gly reduced leukocyte infiltration. Several mitochondrial genes reduced with aging were upregulated in hearts by NAC+Gly diet supplementation. These Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, suggesting improved mitochondrial function, and permeabilized cardiac fibers from NAC+Gly fed mice produced ATP from carbohydrate and fatty acid sources, whereas fibers from control old mice were less able to utilize fatty acids.

	abstract = {Background: Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been linked to obesity-associated chronic inflammation. Microbiota manipulation may therefore affect obesity-related comorbidities. Blueberries are rich in anthocyanins, which have anti-inflammatory properties and may alter the gut microbiota.
Objective: We hypothesized that blueberry supplementation would alter the gut microbiota, reduce systemic inflammation, and improve insulin resistance in high-fat (HF)-diet-fed rats.
Methods: Twenty-four male Wistar rats (260-270 g; n = 8/group) were fed low-fat (LF; 10\% fat), HF (45\% fat), or HF with 10\% by weight blueberry powder (HF\_BB) diets for 8 wk. LF rats were fed ad libitum, whereas HF and HF\_BB rats were pair-fed with diets matched for fiber and sugar contents. Glucose tolerance, microbiota composition (16S ribosomal RNA sequencing), intestinal integrity [villus height, gene expression of mucin 2 (Muc2) and β-defensin 2 (Defb2)], and inflammation (gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines) were assessed.
Results: Blueberry altered microbiota composition with an increase in Gammaproteobacteria abundance (P {\textless} 0.001) compared with LF and HF rats. HF feeding led to an ∼15\% decrease in ileal villus height compared with LF rats (P {\textless} 0.05), which was restored by blueberry supplementation. Ileal gene expression of Muc2 was ∼150\% higher in HF\_BB rats compared with HF rats (P {\textless} 0.05), with expression in the LF group not being different from that in either the HF or HF\_BB groups. Tumor necrosis factor α (Tnfa) and interleukin 1β (Il1b) gene expression in visceral fat was increased by HF feeding when compared with the LF group (by 300\% and 500\%, respectively; P {\textless} 0.05) and normalized by blueberry supplementation. Finally, blueberry improved markers of insulin sensitivity. Hepatic insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) phosphorylation at serine 307:IRS1 ratio was ∼35\% higher in HF rats compared with LF rats (P {\textless} 0.05) and HF\_BB rats.
Conclusion: In HF-diet-fed male rats, blueberry supplementation led to compositional changes in the gut microbiota associated with improvements in systemic inflammation and insulin signaling.},

	abstract = {Alterations in adipocyte characteristics are highly implicated in the pathology of obesity. In a recent article, we demonstrated that high-fat diet-induced obesity impairs lysosomal function, thereby suppressing autophagy in mice white adipose tissue. Taurine, an amino acid naturally contained in the normal diet and existing ubiquitously in tissues, has been reported to improve insulin resistance and chronic inflammation in animal models, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. From these findings, we hypothesized that improvement of obese pathology by taurine may be mediated through recovery of autophagy. In matured 3T3-L1 mouse adipocytes, treatment with taurine-promoted autophagy. Moreover, taurine-induced nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagy- and lysosome-related factors. As this translocation is regulated by several kinase pathways, including extracellular signal-related kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and mechanistic target of rapamycin protein kinase complex 1 (MTORC1), we examined related signaling elements. Consequently, taurine-reduced phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 but did not alter the phosphorylation of MTORC1 pathway-associated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase or ribosomal protein S6 kinase. Taken together, these results suggest that taurine may enhance TFEB nuclear translocation through ERK1/2 to accelerate autophagy. The effect discovered in this study may represent a novel mechanism for the improvement of obesity-related pathology by taurine.},

OBJECTIVE: To confirm the efficacy and safety of MD1003 in progressive MS in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
METHODS: Patients (n = 154) with a baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 4.5-7 and evidence of disease worsening within the previous 2 years were randomised to 12-month MD1003 (100 mg biotin) or placebo thrice daily, followed by 12-month MD1003 for all patients. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with disability reversal at month 9, confirmed at month 12, defined as an EDSS decrease of ⩾1 point (⩾0.5 for EDSS 6-7) or a ⩾20\% decrease in timed 25-foot walk time compared with the best baseline among screening or randomisation visits.
RESULTS: A total of 13 (12.6\%) MD1003-treated patients achieved the primary endpoint versus none of the placebo-treated patients (p = 0.005). MD1003 treatment also reduced EDSS progression and improved clinical impression of change compared with placebo. Efficacy was maintained over follow-up, and the safety profile of MD1003 was similar to that of placebo.
CONCLUSION: MD1003 achieves sustained reversal of MS-related disability in a subset of patients with progressive MS and is well tolerated.},

	shorttitle = {Effect of long-term selenium supplementation on mortality},
	doi = {10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.02.015},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selenium, an essential trace element, is incorporated into selenoproteins with a wide range of health effects. Selenoproteins may reach repletion at a plasma selenium concentration of {\textasciitilde} 125 µg/L, at which point the concentration of selenoprotein P reaches a plateau; whether sustained concentrations higher than this are beneficial, or indeed detrimental, is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: In a population of relatively low selenium status, we aimed to determine the effect on mortality of long-term selenium supplementation at different dose levels.
DESIGN: The Denmark PRECISE study was a single-centre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-arm, parallel clinical trial with four groups. Participants were 491 male and female volunteers aged 60-74 years, recruited at Odense University Hospital, Denmark. The trial was initially designed as a 6-month pilot study, but supplemental funding allowed for extension of the study and mortality assessment. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment with 100, 200, or 300 µg selenium/d as selenium-enriched-yeast or placebo-yeast for 5 years from randomization in 1998-1999 and were followed up for mortality for a further 10 years (through March 31, 2015).
RESULTS: During 6871 person-years of follow-up, 158 deaths occurred. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the hazard ratio (95\% confidence interval) for all-cause mortality comparing 300 µg selenium/d to placebo was 1.62 (0.66, 3.96) after 5 years of treatment and 1.59 (1.02, 2.46) over the entire follow-up period. The 100 and 200 µg/d doses showed non-significant decreases in mortality during the intervention period that disappeared after treatment cessation. Although we lacked power for endpoints other than all-cause mortality, the effects on cancer and cardiovascular mortality appeared similar.
CONCLUSIONS: A 300 µg/d dose of selenium taken for 5 years in a country with moderately-low selenium status increased all-cause mortality 10 years later. While our study was not initially designed to evaluate mortality and the sample size was limited, our findings indicate that total selenium intake over 300 µg/d and high-dose selenium supplements should be avoided.},

	abstract = {Depending on the length of their carbon backbone and their saturation status, natural fatty acids have rather distinct biological effects. Thus, longevity of model organisms is increased by extra supply of the most abundant natural cis-unsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid, but not by that of the most abundant saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid. Here, we systematically compared the capacity of different saturated, cis-unsaturated and alien (industrial or ruminant) trans-unsaturated fatty acids to provoke cellular stress in vitro, on cultured human cells expressing a battery of distinct biosensors that detect signs of autophagy, Golgi stress and the unfolded protein response. In contrast to cis-unsaturated fatty acids, trans-unsaturated fatty acids failed to stimulate signs of autophagy including the formation of GFP-LC3B-positive puncta, production of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, and activation of the transcription factor TFEB. When combined effects were assessed, several trans-unsaturated fatty acids including elaidic acid (the trans-isomer of oleate), linoelaidic acid, trans-vaccenic acid and palmitelaidic acid, were highly efficient in suppressing autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by palmitic, but not by oleic acid. Elaidic acid also inhibited autophagy induction by palmitic acid in vivo, in mouse livers and hearts. We conclude that the well-established, though mechanistically enigmatic toxicity of trans-unsaturated fatty acids may reside in their capacity to abolish cytoprotective stress responses induced by saturated fatty acids.},

We implemented a community-based cluster-randomised effectiveness trial in sixty randomly selected districts in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. We randomly allocated each district to treatment and randomly selected one of its villages. In parallel to national salt iodisation efforts, iodised salt was brought early into the markets of the thirty intervention villages before it became widely available in the thirty control villages 4-6 months later. The primary outcome was children's mental development scores on the Bayley Scales. This was an intention-to-treat analysis using mixed linear models adjusted for covariates and clusters. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT013496. We assessed 1835 infants aged 5-11 months at baseline. The same children (85 \% of the sample) were re-assessed at 20-29 months when all villages had iodised salt. At endline, urinary iodine concentration was higher in children in the intervention group compared with those in the control group (median 228·0 v. 155·1 µg/l, P=0·001). The intervention group had higher scores compared with the control group on the Bayley composite score (raw scores:130·60 v. 128·51; standardised scores: 27·8 v. 26·9; d=0·13; 95 \% CI 0·02, 0·23) and three of the four subscales: cognitive (53·27 v. 52·54, d=0·13; 95 \% CI 0·03, 0·23), receptive language (20·71 v. 20·18, d=0·13; 95 \% CI 0·03, 0·24) and fine motor (35·45 v. 34·94, d=0·15; 95 \% CI 0·04, 0·25).

METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of science and Google Scholar were searched up to December, 2017. All RCTs using synbiotic supplements to treat NAFLD included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Mean Difference (MD) was pooled using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Eleven eligible databases from seven RCTs were identified for the present meta-analysis. Our results showed that synbiotic supplementation can decrease body weight, fasting blood sugar, insulin, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha, alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels among patients with NAFLD. In contrast, synbiotic did not have favorable effects on body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels compared with the placebo group.

	issn = {1532-1983},
	doi = {10.1016/j.clnu.2018.03.011},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The beneficial effects of selenium (Se) to human health are exerted by selenoproteins, which can be quantified in blood and used as biomarkers of Se status. Different responses of Se biomarkers after supplementation with selenomethionine and sodium selenite have been observed and some of them could be due to genetic polymorphisms, mainly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Brazil nuts are known to be the richest natural source of Se.
OBJECTIVE: Investigate how genetic variations in selenoprotein genes modulate biomarkers of Se status in response to Brazil nut supplementation.
METHODS: The SU.BRA.NUT study was a four month interventional trial which involved healthy volunteers of both genders, selected in University of Sao Paulo. The supplementation was done with one Brazil nut a day for 8 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of washout. Blood samples were collected at 5 time points: baseline, 4 and 8 weeks of supplementation and 4 and 8 weeks of washout for analysis of five biomarkers of Se status - erythrocyte GPx1 (Glutathione Peroxidase 1) activity, plasma GPx3 activity, plasma Se, erythrocyte Se, and plasma selenoprotein P. The gene expression of GPX1, SELENOP, SELENOF and SELENOS was done before and after 8 weeks of supplementation. The volunteers were genotyped for SNPs in GPX1 (rs1050450, rs3811699 and rs1800699), GPX4 (rs713041), SELENOP (rs3877899 and rs7579), SELENOF (rs5845) and SELENOS (rs34713741).
RESULTS: A total of 130 volunteers finished the protocol. The concentrations of four biomarkers of Se status increased significantly after 4 and 8 weeks of supplementation, being modulated by gender. In addition, erythrocyte GPx1 activity was associated with rs1050450, rs713041 and rs5845. Plasma Se was associated with rs7579 and selenoprotein P with plasma Se at baseline. Nut supplementation significantly increased GPX1 mRNA expression only in subjects with CC genotype at rs1050450. SELENOP mRNA expression was significantly lower in subjects with GG genotype at rs7579 before and after supplementation.
CONCLUSION: Genetic variations in GPX1 and SELENOP genes are associated with different responses of molecular and biochemical biomarkers of Se status after Brazil nut supplementation in healthy Brazilians. The SU.BRA.NUT study was registred at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT 03111355.},

Recently, RSV was reported as a new potential agent to suppress inflammation of collagen-induced arthritis in a mouse model. Nevertheless, the clinical benefits of RSV in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were not studied. This randomized controlled clinical trial aims to shed some light on the therapeutic benefits of RSV in the treatment of RA in patients with different stages of the disease activity. In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 100 RA patients (68 female, 32 male) were enrolled randomly and divided into two groups, each of 50 patients: an RSV-treated group that received a daily RSV capsule of 1 g with the conventional treatment for 3 months and a control group that just received the regular treatment. The clinical and biochemical markers of RA in both groups were assessed. It was found that the clinical markers (i.e., the 28-joint count for swelling and tenderness) and the disease activity score assessment for 28 joints were significantly lowered in the RSV-treated group. Moreover, serum levels of certain biochemical markers (i.e., C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, undercarboxylated osteocalcin, matrix metalloproteinase-3, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-6) were also significantly decreased in RSV-treated patients. The current study suggests the addition of RSV as an adjuvant to the conventional antirheumatic drugs.},

METHODS: L6 cells were acutely (2 h) and chronically (6 and 12 h) exposed to palmitate, and the expression of several proteins involved in insulin resistance, ER stress and inflammation were analyzed.

Only acute palmitate treatment increased GRP78 (28\%, P {\textless} 0.05), PERK (98\%, P {\textless} 0.01), eIF-2A (35\%, P {\textless} 0.01), IRE1a (60\%, P {\textless} 0.05) and TRAF2 (23\%, P {\textless} 0.05) protein content, and PERK phosphorylation (106\%, P {\textless} 0.001), but did not elicit eIF-2A, IKK phosphorylation or increased XBP1 nuclear content. Additionally, acute and chronic palmitate increased NFKB p65 nuclear content ({\textasciitilde} 30\%, P {\textless} 0.05) and NFKB binding activity to Slc2a4 gene promoter ({\textasciitilde} 45\%, P {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Different pathways are activated in acute and chronic palmitate induced-repression of Slc2a4/GLUT4 expression. This regulation involves activation of initial component of ER stress, such as the formation of a IRE1a-TRAF2-IKK complex, and converges to NFKB-induced repression of Slc2a4/GLUT4. These results link ER stress, inflammation and insulin resistance in L6 cells.},

Unfortunately, both of these patient groups are quite sensitive to chemotherapy toxicities. Investigation of blueberries specifically as an anti-AML agent has been limited, despite being a prominent natural product with no reported toxicity. In this study, blueberry extracts are reported for the first time to exert a dietary therapeutic effect in animal models of AML. Furthermore, in vitro studies revealed that blueberry extracts exerted anti-AML efficacy against myeloid leukemia cell lines as well as against primary AML, and specifically provoked Erk and Akt regulation within the leukemia stem cell subpopulation. This study provides evidence that blueberries may be unique sources for anti-AML biopharmaceutical compound discovery, further warranting fractionation of this natural product. More so, blueberries themselves may provide an intriguing dietary option to enhance the anti-AML efficacy of traditional therapy for subsets of patients that otherwise may not tolerate rigorous combinations of therapeutics.},

	abstract = {A large body of biomedical evidence indicates that activation of Nrf2 by curcumin increases the nucleophilic tone and damps inflammation cumulatively supporting the malignant phenotype. Conversely, genetic analyses suggest a possible oncogenic nature of constitutive Nrf2 activation since an increased nucleophilic tone is alleged increasing chemoresistance of cancer cells. Aiming to contribute to solve this paradox, this study addressed the issue of safety and efficacy of curcumin as complementary therapy of gemcitabine on pancreatic cancer. This was a single centre, single arm prospective phase II trial. Patients received gemcitabine and Meriva®, a patented preparation of curcumin complexed with phospholipids. Primary endpoint was response rate, secondary endpoints were progression free survival, overall survival, tolerability and quality of life. Analysis of inflammatory biomarkers was also carried out. Fifty-two consecutive patients were enrolled. Forty-four (13 locally advanced and 31 metastatic) were suitable for primary endpoint evaluation. Median age was 66 years (range 42-87); 42 patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1. The median number of treatment cycle was 4.5 (range 2-14). We observed 27.3\% of response rate and 34.1\% of cases with stable disease, totalizing a disease control rate of 61.4\%. The median progression free survival and overall survival were 8.4 and 10.2 months, respectively. Higher IL-6 and sCD40L levels before treatment were associated to a worse overall survival (p {\textless} 0.01). Increases in sCD40L levels after 1 cycle of chemotherapy were associated with a reduced response to the therapy. Grade 3/4 toxicity was observed (neutropenia, 38.6\%; anemia, 6.8\%). There were no significant changes in quality of life during therapy. In conclusion, the complementary therapy to gemcitabine with phytosome complex of curcumin is not only safe but also efficiently translate in a good response rate in first line therapy of advanced pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {KEY POINTS: The recent development of exogenous ketone supplements allows direct testing of the metabolic effects of elevated blood ketones without the confounding influence of widespread changes experienced with ketogenic diets or prolonged fasting. In the present study, we determined the effect of (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate ketone monoester on the glycaemic response and insulin sensitivity index during a 2 h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in humans. The results obtained show that consuming a ketone monoester supplement 30 min prior to an OGTT reduced the glycaemic response and markers of insulin sensitivity without affecting insulin secretion. The findings of the present study provides evidence that ketone supplements could have therapeutic potential for future application as a glucose-lowering nutritional supplement.
ABSTRACT: The main objectives of the present study were: (i) to determine whether acute ingestion of ketone monoester (Kme ); (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate impacts plasma glucose levels during a standardized oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and (ii) to compare changes in insulin concentrations and estimates of insulin sensitivity after acute Kme supplementation. Twenty healthy participants (n = 10 males/females) aged between 18 and 35 years took part in a randomized cross-over study. After an overnight fast, participants consumed a Kme supplement (ΔG®; TΔS Ltd, UK, Oxford, UK; 0.45 ml kg-1 body weight) or placebo (water) 30 min before completing a 75 g OGTT. Blood samples were collected every 15-30 min over 2.5 h. The participants and study personnel performing the laboratory analyses were blinded to the study condition. Kme acutely raised blood d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) to 3.2 ± 0.6 mm within 30 min with levels remaining elevated throughout the entire OGTT. Compared to placebo, Kme significantly decreased the glucose area under the curve (AUC; -16\%, P = 0.001), non-esterified fatty acid AUC (-44\%, P {\textless} 0.001) and C-peptide incremental AUC (P = 0.005), at the same time as improving oral glucose insulin sensitivity index by ∼11\% (P = 0.001). In conclusion, a Kme supplement that acutely increased β-OHB levels up to ∼3 mm attenuated the glycaemic response to an OGTT in healthy humans. The reduction in glycaemic response did not appear to be driven by an increase in insulin secretion, although it was accompanied by improved markers of insulin sensitivity. These results suggest that ketone monoester supplements could have therapeutic potential in the management and prevention of metabolic diseases.},

After 28 d feeding, body weight, plasma triglyceride levels and the weights of perirenal adipose tissue and epididymal fat pad were significantly lower in rats fed diets supplemented with garlic powder than in those fed diets without garlic powder. The content of mitochondrial protein and uncoupling protein (UCP) in IBAT, and urinary noradrenaline and adrenaline excretion were significantly greater in rats fed a lard diet with garlic powder than in those fed the same diet without garlic. Other than adrenaline secretion, differences due to garlic were significant in rats fed shortening, also. In Experiment 2, the effects of various allyl-containing sulfides present in garlic on noradrenaline and adrenaline secretion were evaluated. Administration of diallyldisulfide, diallyltrisulfide and alliin, organosulfur compounds present in garlic, significantly increased plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations, whereas the administration of disulfides without allyl residues, diallylmonosulfide and S-allyl-L-cysteine did not increase adrenaline secretion.

We determine that germ-free (GF) mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and malabsorb fat with specifically impaired lipid digestion and absorption within the small intestine. Small bowel microbes are essential for host adaptation to dietary lipid changes by regulating gut epithelial processes involved in their digestion and absorption. In addition, GF mice conventionalized with high-fat diet-induced jejunal microbiota exhibit increased lipid absorption even when fed a low-fat diet. Conditioned media from specific bacterial strains directly upregulate lipid absorption genes in murine proximal small intestinal epithelial organoids. These findings indicate that proximal gut microbiota play key roles in host adaptability to dietary lipidÂ variations through mechanisms involving both the digestive and absorptive phases and that these functions may contribute to conditions of over- and undernutrition.},

	abstract = {In the year-long FlaxPAD clinical trial (Flaxseed for Peripheral Artery Disease), dietary flaxseed generated a powerful reduction in brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with peripheral artery disease. Oxylipins were implicated as potential mechanistic mediators. However, the ability of flaxseed to impact central aortic hypertension, arterial stiffness, or cardiac performance was not investigated. Additionally, the relationship between central blood pressure (cBP) and oxylipins was not elucidated. Therefore, radial tonometry and pulse wave analysis were used to measure cBP and cardiac function in the FlaxPAD population (n=62). Plasma oxylipins were analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. In patients with high blood pressure at baseline, the average decrease in central systolic and diastolic blood pressures versus placebo was 10 and 6 mmâ€‰Hg, respectively. Flaxseed did not significantly impact augmentation index or other cardiac function indices. Alternatively, the data support several specific oxylipins as potential mediators in the antihypertensive properties of flaxseed. For example, every 1 nmol/L increase in plasma 16-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid increased the odds of higher central systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 12- and 9-fold, respectively. Every 1 nmol/L increase in plasma thromboxane B2 and 5,6-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid increased the odds of higher cBP by 33- and 9-fold, respectively. Flaxseed induced a decrease in many oxylipins, which corresponded with a reduced risk of elevated cBP. These data extend the antihypertensive properties of flaxseed to cBP without cardiac involvement but rather through oxylipins. This study provides further support for oxylipins as therapeutic targets in hypertension.

We confirmed that the cytotoxic effect of NK-92 on MDA-MB231 was significantly enhanced in the presence of curcumin, which was highly associated with the activation of Stat4 and Stat5 proteins in NK-92.

Eighty-six patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis having thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 3 and 6 mIU/L, elevated serum antithyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) and/or antithyroglobulin (TgAb), and normal free thyroxine (fT4) and free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels were enrolled in the study: one hyperthyroid subject with TSH about 0.14 μU/ml was included in this trial as a single case. Patients were assigned to receive Myo-Ins-Se. TSH, TPOAb, and TgAb levels were significantly decreased in patients treated with combined Myo-Ins-Se after 6 months of treatment. In addition, a significant fT3 and fT4 increase, along with an amelioration of their quality of life, was observed. Remarkably, TSH values of the hyperthyroid patient increased from 0.14 μU/ml up to 1.02 μU/ml, showing a complete restoration of TSH values at a normal range. In conclusion, the administration of Myo-Ins-Se is significantly effective in decreasing TSH, TPOAb, and TgAb levels, as well as enhancing thyroid hormones and personal wellbeing, therefore restoring euthyroidism in patients diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-dose taurine supplementation for prevention of stroke-like episodes of MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes), a rare genetic disorder caused by point mutations in the mitochondrial DNA that lead to a taurine modification defect at the first anticodon nucleotide of mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR), resulting in failure to decode codons accurately.
METHODS: After the nationwide survey of MELAS, we conducted a multicentre, open-label, phase III trial in which 10 patients with recurrent stroke-like episodes received high-dose taurine (9 g or 12 g per day) for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the complete prevention of stroke-like episodes during the evaluation period. The taurine modification rate of mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) was measured before and after the trial.
RESULTS: The proportion of patients who reached the primary endpoint (100\% responder rate) was 60\% (95\% CI 26.2\% to 87.8\%). The 50\% responder rate, that is, the number of patients achieving a 50\% or greater reduction in frequency of stroke-like episodes, was 80\% (95\% CI 44.4\% to 97.5\%). Taurine reduced the annual relapse rate of stroke-like episodes from 2.22 to 0.72 (P=0.001). Five patients showed a significant increase in the taurine modification of mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) from peripheral blood leukocytes (P{\textless}0.05). No severe adverse events were associated with taurine.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates that oral taurine supplementation can effectively reduce the recurrence of stroke-like episodes and increase taurine modification in mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) in MELAS.

We investigated effects of pure epicatechin supplementation on gene expression profiles of immune cells in humans. In a double blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial, 32 (pre)hypertensive subjects aged 30 to 80, received two 4-week interventions, i.e. epicatechin (100mg/day) or placebo with a 4-week wash-out between interventions. Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were determined before and after both interventions. Epicatechin regulated 1180 genes, of which 234 differed from placebo. Epicatechin upregulated gene sets involved in transcription and tubulin folding and downregulated gene sets involved in inflammation, PPAR signalling and adipogenesis. Several negatively enriched genes within these gene sets were involved in insulin signalling. Most inhibited upstream regulators within the epicatechin intervention were cytokines or involved in inflammation. No upstream regulators were identified compared to placebo. Epicatechin, a cocoa flavan-3-ol, reduces gene expression involved in inflammation, PPAR-signalling and adipogenesis in immune cells. Effects were mild but our findings increase our understanding and provide new leads on how epicatechin rich products like cocoa may affect immune cells and exert cardiometabolic protective effects.},

Surprisingly, this effect relies on anticancer immunosurveillance, as depleting CD8+ T cells, antigen-presenting cells (APCs), or using immunodeficient mice prevented the beneficial effect of the diet. Mechanistically, we established that a Low PROT diet induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) in tumor cells through the activation of IRE1α and RIG1 signaling, thereby resulting in cytokine production and mounting an efficient anticancer immune response.

	abstract = {The role in longevity and healthspan of nicotinamide (NAM), the physiological precursor of NAD+, is elusive. Here, we report that chronic NAM supplementation improves healthspan measures in mice without extending lifespan. Untargeted metabolite profiling of the liver and metabolic flux analysis of liver-derived cells revealed NAM-mediated improvement in glucose homeostasis in mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) that was associated with reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammation concomitant with increased glycogen deposition and flux through the pentose phosphate and glycolytic pathways. Targeted NAD metabolome analysis in liver revealed depressed expression of NAM salvage in NAM-treated mice, an effect counteracted by higher expression of de novo NAD biosynthetic enzymes. Although neither hepatic NAD+ nor NADP+ was boosted by NAM, acetylation of some SIRT1 targets was enhanced by NAM supplementation in a diet- and NAM dose-dependent manner. Collectively, our results show health improvement in NAM-supplemented HFD-fed mice in the absence of survival effects.},

Despite strong ties between fructose and disease, the metabolic fate of fructose in mammals remains incompletely understood. Here we use isotope tracing and mass spectrometry to track the fate of glucose and fructose carbons in vivo, finding that dietary fructose is cleared by the small intestine. Clearance requires the fructose-phosphorylating enzyme ketohexokinase. Low doses of fructose are ∼90\% cleared by the intestine, with only trace fructose but extensive fructose-derived glucose, lactate, and glycerate found in the portal blood. High doses of fructose (≥1 g/kg) overwhelm intestinal fructose absorption and clearance, resulting in fructose reaching both the liver and colonic microbiota. Intestinal fructose clearance is augmented both by prior exposure to fructose and by feeding. We propose that the small intestine shields the liver from otherwise toxic fructose exposure.},

	abstract = {SCOPE: Wakame is an edible seaweed that is a common constituent in the Japanese diet. Previous studies showed that wakame consumption is associated with the prevention of metabolic syndrome, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects are poorly understood.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine if the expression of hepatic genes is affected by ingestion of the brown seaweed Undaria pinnatifida (wakame), rats were fed a diet containing 0, 0.1, or 1.0 g/100 g dried wakame powder for 28 days. Administration of 1\% wakame significantly decreased serum total cholesterol levels. Hepatic gene expression was investigated using DNA microarray analysis, and the results showed that wakame suppresses the lipogenic pathway by downregulating SREBF-1. Moreover, bile acid biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis were promoted by upregulation of the PPAR signaling pathway, which leads to a reduction in the accumulation of cholesterol and promotion of β-oxidation.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that wakame ingestion affects glucose and lipid metabolism by altering the expression of SREBF-1 and PPAR signal related genes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In literature, there are several studies about the effects of nutraceutical combinations at fasting, but data in post-prandial phase are lacking.
PURPOSE: We planned a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a nutraceutical agent containing fermented red rice, phytosterols and olive polyphenols compared to placebo in a sample of Caucasian patients with low cardiovascular risk, both at fasting and after an oral fat load.
STUDY DESIGN: Eighty patients were randomized to receive, as addition to diet and physical activity, a nutraceutical combination containing fermented red rice, sterol esters and stanols, curcumin, and olive polyphenols or placebo (control group), once a day.
METHODS: We evaluated at baseline, and after 3 months: body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and soluble endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1. We evaluated these parameters both at fasting, and after an oral fat load.
RESULTS: Nutraceutical combination gave a reduction of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, both compared to baseline (p {\textless} 0.05 for all), and to placebo (p {\textless} 0.05 for all). We recorded a reduction of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and sE-selectin in the group treated with nutraceutical combination, both compared to baseline (p {\textless} 0.05 for all), and to placebo (p {\textless} 0.05 for all). Parameters recorded during oral fat load improved compared to the oral fat load performed at baseline with the nutraceutical combination.
CONCLUSIONS: The nutraceutical combination of fermented red rice, sterol esters and stanols, curcumin, and olive polyphenols seems to be effective in improving lipid profile and markers of endothelial damage in dyslipidemic patients in primary prevention at low risk for developing cardiovascular disease. The true novelty of this study, however, is the improvement of endothelial damage after an oral fat load compared to placebo.},

The aim of this study is to investigate the bioavailability of five different magnesium compounds (magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, magnesium acetyl taurate, magnesium citrate, and magnesium malate) in different tissues. Following a single dose 400 mg/70 kg magnesium administration to Sprague Dawley rats, bioavailability was evaluated by examining time-dependent absorption, tissue penetration, and the effects on the behavior of the animals. Pharmacokinetically, the area under the curve calculation is highest in the magnesium malate. The magnesium acetyl taurate was found to have the second highest area under the curve calculation. Magnesium acetyl taurate was rapidly absorbed, able to pass through to the brain easily, had the highest tissue concentration level in the brain, and was found to be associated with decreased anxiety indicators. Magnesium malate levels remained high for an extended period of time in the serum. The commonly prescribed dietary supplements magnesium oxide and magnesium citrate had the lowest bioavailability when compared to our control group. More research is needed to investigate the bioavailability of magnesium malate and acetyl taurate compounds and their effects in specific tissues and on behavior.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Paraoxonase 1 (PON1), an enzyme associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL-PON1), is reported to have antioxidant and cardioprotective properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of anthocyanins on the HDL-PON1 activity and cholesterol efflux capacity in hypercholesterolemic subjects.
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 122 hypercholesterolemic subjects were given 160 mg of anthocyanins twice daily or placebo (n = 61 of each group) for 24 weeks in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation.
RESULTS: Anthocyanin consumption significantly increased HDL cholesterol and decreased low -density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations compared with placebo (P {\textless} .018 and P {\textless} .001, respectively). Anthocyanin supplementation also increased the activity of HDL-PON1 compared with placebo (P {\textless} .001). Furthermore, cholesterol efflux capacity was increased more in the anthocyanin group (20.0\% increase) than in the placebo group (0.2\% increase) (P {\textless} .001). The negative correlations established between HDL-PON1 activity and the levels of lipid hydroperoxides associated with HDL confirm the relationship between PON1 activity and lipid peroxidation of lipoproteins. Furthermore, a strong positive correlation was noted between increased HDL-PON1 activity and improved cholesterol efflux capacity both before and after adjustment for HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI in anthocyanin-treated subjects (both P {\textless} .001). Inhibition of HDL-PON1 activity strongly prevented the antioxidant ability of HDL and attenuated the cholesterol efflux capacity of subjects from anthocyanin group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that the alterations of PON1 activity by anthocyanin observed in hypercholesterolemic HDL reflect a shift to an improvement of cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL and may provide a link between anthocyanin and cardioprotective effects.},

This common etiologic factor not only contributes to atherosclerotic diseases but also to PMOP following an almost identical mechanism including dysfunctional HDL and lipid oxidation. According to recent studies, lipid oxidation might improve osteoblastic transformation of vascular cells and obstruct such transformation in bone cells. The primary objective of this current review was to summarize the evidence revealing the role of HDL-associated PON1 enzyme in PMOP. Additionally, the review aimed to address some of the subjects that need further investigation in order to define whether hyperhomocysteinemia and sensitivity to lipid oxidation may be risk factors for PMOP.},

DESIGN: In a double-blind randomized clinical trial with a parallel design, 52 hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to 50 g/day soy protein containing 164 mg isoflavones or placebo, for 10 weeks. Serum lipoproteins and PON1 activity were measured at baseline and at the 10th week.
RESULTS: There was significant increase in PON1 activity (P=0.029) and a significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triacylglycerol/HDL-C and TC/HDL-C in the soy group compared with the placebo group (P=0.001, P=0.008, P=0.012, P=0.04 and P=0.029, respectively) at the end of the study. Similarly, PON1 activity was significantly increased (P=0.015) and LDL-C, TC, LDL-C/HDL-C, triacylglycerol/HDL-C and TC/HDL-C were significantly decreased (P=0.001, P=0.002, P=0.001, P=0.016 and P=0.001) at the end of the study compared with the beginning value in soy group.

We previously reported AMPK activation and increased muscle glucose uptake by rosemary extract (RE). In the present study, we examined the effects and the mechanism of action of rosmarinic acid (RA), a major RE constituent, in L6 rat muscle cells. RA (5.0 µM) increased glucose uptake (186 ± 4.17\% of control, p {\textless} 0.001) to levels comparable to maximum insulin (204 ± 10.73\% of control, p {\textless} 0.001) and metformin (202 ± 14.37\% of control, p {\textless} 0.001). Akt phosphorylation was not affected by RA, while AMPK phosphorylation was increased. The RA-stimulated glucose uptake was inhibited by the AMPK inhibitor compound C and was not affected by wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). The current study shows an effect of RA to increase muscle glucose uptake and AMPK phosphorylation. RA deserves further study as it shows potential to be used as an agent to regulate glucose homeostasis.},

We found that supplementation of RA increased the expression of key genes involved in the mitochondrial biogenesis like PGC-1α, SIRT-1, and TFAM via activation of AMPK in the skeletal muscle of insulin resistant rats as well as in L6 myotubes. Further, RA treatment increased the glucose uptake and decreased the phosphorylation of serine IRS-1 while increasing the translocation of GLUT 4.

	doi = {10.1111/jch.13273},
	abstract = {Pentraxin-3 is a sensitive marker of inflammation that plays dual roles, pathogenic and cardioprotective, in the progression of cardiovascular diseases. Inflammation is intimately involved in salt-induced hypertension. We investigated the responses of pentraxin-3 to sodium and potassium supplementation to elucidate the potential role of pentraxin-3 in salt-induced hypertension. A total of 48 participants from northwest China were enrolled. All participants were maintained on a 3-day normal diet, which was sequentially followed by a 7-day low-sodium diet, a 7-day high-sodium diet, and a 7-day high-sodium plus potassium diet. Plasma concentrations of pentraxin-3 were assessed using ELISA. Plasma pentraxin-3 decreased significantly during the low-salt period compared to baseline (0.57 ± 0.19 ng/mL vs 0.72 ± 0.33 ng/mL, P = .012) and increased during the high-salt period (0.68 ± 0.26 ng/mL vs 0.57 ± 0.19 ng/mL, P = .037). Potassium supplementation inhibited salt-induced increase in pentraxin-3 (0.56 ± 0.21 ng/mL vs 0.68 ± 0.26 ng/mL, P = .015). Ln-transformed pentraxin-3 at baseline was inversely correlated with BMI (r = -.349, P = .02), DBP (r = -.414, P = .005), MAP (r = -.360, P = .017). We found a positive correlation between the ln-transformed concentrations of pentraxin-3 and 24-hour urinary sodium during low and high Na+ periods (r = .269, P = .012) and a negative relationship with 24 hours urinary potassium excretion during high-salt and high-salt plus potassium periods (r = -.246, P = .02). These correlations remained significant after adjusting for confounders. Pentraxin-3 responses were more prominent in salt-sensitive individuals than salt-resistant individuals. Dietary salt and potassium interventions significantly altered circulating pentraxin-3.},

We report that, in mice, excess dietary salt suppresses resting cerebral blood flow and endothelial function, leading to cognitive impairment. The effect depends on expansion of TH17 cells in the small intestine, resulting in a marked increase in plasma interleukin-17 (IL-17). Circulating IL-17, in turn, promotes endothelial dysfunction and cognitive impairment by the Rho kinase-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and reduced nitric oxide production in cerebral endothelial cells. The findings reveal a new gut-brain axis linking dietary habits to cognitive impairment through a gut-initiated adaptive immune response compromising brain function via circulating IL-17. Thus, the TH17 cell-IL-17 pathway is a putative target to counter the deleterious brain effects induced by dietary salt and other diseases associated with TH17 polarization.},

Sixteen healthy subjects (10 men; 6 women; 26 ± 0.9 years; BMI 22.93 ± 0.53 kg m-2) completed a randomized, crossover intervention study. The BPB's bioactive compounds were characterized using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source (UHPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF-MS). Nine compounds tentatively identified in BPB include: dihydroxybenzoic acid hexoside-pentoside, decaffeoyl-acteoside, cynaroside A, apigenin 6,8-di-C-hexoside, luteolin 6-C-hexoside-8-C-rhamnoside, apigenin 8-C-hexoside-C-deoxyhexoside, kaempferol 3-rhamnoside-4'-xyloside, apigenin 7-neohesperidoside, and apigenin-8-C-arabinopyranoside-2''-rhamnoside. Blood glucose and serum insulin responses, insulin sensitivity and β-cell function were not affected during the acute intervention with BPB. Neither were effects on gastrointestinal well-being observed after BPB. However, BPB modulated overall acute appetite by lowering 'hunger', 'desire to eat', and 'prospective consumption', and increasing 'satiety' and 'fullness'. In contrast, there were no changes in gut (peptide tyrosine-tyrosine [PYY] and glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1]) and thyroid (triiodothyronine [T3] and thyroxine [T4]) hormones after BPB compared to the control beverage. In conclusion, inclusion of BPB prior to the WWB challenge meal might be beneficial for appetite modulation, but we did not find supporting evidence in glycaemia, gut and thyroid hormones. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of appetite-reducing pungent spices, such as black pepper.},

Following oral NaHCO3 loading, macrophage polarization was shifted from predominantly M1 (inflammatory) to M2 (regulatory) phenotypes, and FOXP3+CD4+ T-lymphocytes increased in the spleen, blood, and kidneys of rats. Similar anti-inflammatory changes in macrophage polarization were observed in the blood of human subjects following NaHCO3 ingestion. Surprisingly, we found that gentle manipulation to visualize the spleen at midline during surgical laparotomy (sham splenectomy) was sufficient to abolish the response in rats and resulted in hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the capsular mesothelial cells. Thin collagenous connections lined by mesothelial cells were found to connect to the capsular mesothelium. Mesothelial cells in these connections stained positive for the pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5 and acetylcholine esterase and contained many ultrastructural elements, which visually resembled neuronal structures. Both disruption of the fragile mesothelial connections or transection of the vagal nerves resulted in the loss of capsular mesothelial acetylcholine esterase staining and reduced splenic mass. Our data indicate that oral NaHCO3 activates a splenic anti-inflammatory pathway and provides evidence that the signals that mediate this response are transmitted to the spleen via a novel neuronal-like function of mesothelial cells.},

The present study was designed to investigate in rats the antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects of a hydrophilic extract of Ulva sp. (MSP) containing about 45\% of ulvans.
METHODS: After a 14-day administration of MSP at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg/day, 48 and 60 male adult Wistar rats were respectively tested in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and the forced swimming test (FST). In the FST, MSP effects were compared to the reference antidepressant drug imipramine (IMI) (10 mg/kg/day). Acute and sub-chronic toxicities of the extract were also assessed in male and female rats following OECD guidelines.
RESULTS: MSP treatment did not modify anxiety-related behaviour in the EPM. In contrast, MSP induced a dose-dependent reduction of immobility behaviour in the FST. At the highest tested dose of 40 mg/kg, MSP displayed a significant antidepressant-like effect similar to IMI. MSP did not modify the exploratory behaviour of rats in the open field test and did not produce any toxic effect.
DISCUSSION: MSP may potentially represent a good adjunct or alternative to existing antidepressant therapeutics. Further studies are necessary to confirm the mechanism of action of MSP and its modulation of brain functioning.},

	abstract = {Chronic inflammation, mediated in large part by proinflammatory macrophage populations, contributes directly to the induction and perpetuation of metabolic diseases, including obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can have profound effects on inflammation through the formation of bioactive oxygenated metabolites called oxylipins. The objective of this study was to determine if exposure to the dietary omega-3 PUFA α-linolenic acid (ALA) can dampen the inflammatory properties of classically activated (M1-like) macrophages derived from the human THP-1 cell line and to examine the accompanying alterations in oxylipin secretion. We find that ALA treatment leads to a reduction in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α production. Although ALA is known to be converted to longer-chain PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), DHA oxylipins were reduced overall by ALA treatment, as was LPS-induced secretion of EPA oxylipins. In contrast, we observed profound increases in oxylipins directly derived from ALA. Lipoxygenase products of linoleic acid were also dramatically increased, and LPS-induced production of AA oxylipins, particularly prostaglandin D2, was reduced. These results suggest that ALA may act to dampen the inflammatory phenotype of M1-like macrophages by a unique set of mechanisms distinct from those used by the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. Thus, there is strong rationale for investigating the functions of ALA oxylipins and lesser-known LA oxylipins since they hold promise as anti-inflammatory agents.},

A low-protein diet is recommended to slow diabetic nephropathy progression because each protein load leads to renal hemodynamic variations. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether the advanced glycation end products (AGE) content of a protein load is responsible for the protein-induced renal hemodynamic variations in humans.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten healthy subjects were assigned to a high-protein (1 g/kg) low-AGE (3,000 kU AGE) versus high-AGE (30,000 kU AGE) meal. Renal perfusion, oxygen consumption, and oxygen content were measured before and 120 min after each meal.
RESULTS: Renal perfusion (3.2 ± 0.5 vs. 3.8 ± 0.4 mL/min/g (P = 0.0002) and oxygen consumption (0.3 ± 0.04 vs 0.4 ± 0.08 min-1, P = 0.005) increased significantly after the high-AGE meal compared with the low-AGE meal.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the AGE content of a protein load is responsible for renal hemodynamic modifications. Therefore, prevention of diabetic nephropathy progression could aim predominantly at reducing food AGE content.},

We now show that the addition of a chemically defined AGE (methyl-glyoxal-BSA) to low-AGE mouse chow increased serum levels of AGEs and OS, demonstrating that dietary AGEs are oxidants that can induce systemic OS. OS predisposes to the development of cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases; calorie restriction (CR) is the most studied means to decrease OS, increase longevity, and reduce OS-related organ damage in mammals. Because reduction of food intake also decreases oxidant AGE s intake, we asked whether the beneficial effects of CR in mammals are related to the restriction of oxidants or energy. Pair-fed mice were provided either a CR diet or a high-AGE CR diet in which AGEs were elevated by brief heat treatment (CR-high). Old CR-high mice developed high levels of 8-isoprostanes, AGEs, RAGE, and p66shc, coupled with low AGER1 and GSH/GSSG levels, insulin resistance, marked myocardial and renal fibrosis, and shortened lifespan. In contrast, old CR mice had low OS, p66shc, RAGE, and AGE levels, but high AGER1 levels, coupled with longer lifespan. Therefore, the beneficial effects of a CR diet may be partly related to reduced oxidant intake, a principal determinant of oxidant status in aging mice, rather than decreased energy intake.},

This report significantly expands the available dAGE database, validates the dAGE testing methodology, compares cooking procedures and inhibitory agents on new dAGE formation, and introduces practical approaches for reducing dAGE consumption in daily life. Based on the findings, dry heat promotes new dAGE formation by {\textgreater}10- to 100-fold above the uncooked state across food categories. Animal-derived foods that are high in fat and protein are generally AGE-rich and prone to new AGE formation during cooking. In contrast, carbohydrate-rich foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and milk contain relatively few AGEs, even after cooking. The formation of new dAGEs during cooking was prevented by the AGE inhibitory compound aminoguanidine and significantly reduced by cooking with moist heat, using shorter cooking times, cooking at lower temperatures, and by use of acidic ingredients such as lemon juice or vinegar. The new dAGE database provides a valuable instrument for estimating dAGE intake and for guiding food choices to reduce dAGE intake.},

However, the mechanisms mediating the effects of (-)-EPI are not fully understood. We previously identified a role of the G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in modulating the vascular effects of (-)-EPI. We therefore tested the hypothesis that GPER mediates (at least in part) the stimulatory effects of (-)-EPI on MiB in SkM cells. As an in vitro model, we employed mouse SkM-derived C2C12 myoblasts differentiated into myotubes. Using confocal microscopy, we detected GPER at the cell surface and cytoplasm in C2C12 myotubes. Treatment with (-)-EPI (3 and 10μM) resulted in the stimulation of MiB as per increases in mitochondrial inner (MitoTracker Red FM fluorescence staining) and outer membrane (porin protein levels) markers, transcription factors involved in MiB stimulation (i.e., nuclear respiratory factor-2 [NRF-2] and mitochondrial transcription factor A [TFAM] protein levels) and citrate synthase (CS) activity levels. (-)-EPI-treated myotubes were longer and wider compared to vehicle-treated myotubes. The effects of (-)-EPI on myotube mitochondria and cell size were larger in magnitude to those observed with the GPER agonist G-1. The chemical blockade and down-regulation (siRNA) of GPER evidenced a partial and complete blockade of measured endpoints following (-)-EPI- or G-1-treatment, respectively. Altogether, results indicate that GPER is expressed in muscle cells and appears to mediate to a significant extent, the stimulatory effects of (-)-EPI on MiB. Thus, GPER activation may account for the stimulatory effects of (-)-EPI on SkM structure/function.},

	abstract = {SCOPE: Circadian clock plays a principal role in orchestrating our daily physiology and metabolism, and their perturbation can evoke metabolic diseases such as fatty liver and insulin resistance. Nobiletin (NOB) has been demonstrated to possess antitumor and neuroprotective activities. The objective of the current study is to determine potential effects of NOB on modulating the core clock gene Bmal1 regarding ameliorating glucolipid metabolic disorders.
RESULTS: Our results revealed that NOB partially reverse the relatively shallow daily oscillations of circadian clock genes and reset phase-shifting circadian rhythms in primary hepatocytes under metabolic disorders conditions. Importantly, NOB was found to be effective at amplifying glucose uptake via stimulating IRS-1/AKT signaling pathway, as well as blunting palmitate-induced lipogenesis in HepG2 cells via modulating AMPK-Sirt1 signaling pathway and key enzymes of de novo lipogenesis in a Bmal1-dependent manner. NOB attenuated palmitate-stimulated excessive secretions of ROS, restored the depletions of mitochondrial membrane potential, which is similar to the recovery in expressions of mitochondrial respiration complex I-IV.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to provide compelling evidences that NOB prevent cellular glucolipid metabolic imbalance and mitochondrial function in a Bmal1-dependent manner. Overall, NOB may serve as a nutritional preventive strategy in recovering metabolic disorders relevant to circadian clock.},

Molecular mechanisms causing delirium are largely unknown. However, critical illness and the ICU environment consistently disrupt circadian rhythms, and circadian disruptions are strongly associated with delirium. Exposure to benzodiazepines and constant light are suspected risk factors for the development of delirium. Thus, we tested the functional role of the circadian rhythm protein Period 2 (PER2) in different mouse models resembling delirium.

SETTING: University experimental laboratory.
SUBJECTS: Wildtype, Per2 mice.
INTERVENTIONS: Midazolam, lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide), constant light, nobiletin, or sham-treated animals.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Midazolam significantly reduced the expression of PER2 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the hippocampus of wild-type mice. Behavioral tests following midazolam exposure revealed a robust phenotype including executive dysfunction and memory impairment suggestive of delirium. These findings indicated a critical role of hippocampal expressed PER2. Similar results were obtained in mice exposed to lipopolysaccharide or constant light. Subsequent studies in Per2 mice confirmed a functional role of PER2 in a midazolam-induced delirium-like phenotype. Using the small molecule nobiletin to enhance PER2 function, the cognitive deficits induced by midazolam or constant light were attenuated in wild-type mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These experiments identify a novel role for PER2 during a midazolam- or constant light-induced delirium-like state, highlight the importance of hippocampal PER2 expression for cognitive function, and suggest the PER2 enhancer nobiletin as potential therapy in delirium-like conditions associated with circadian disruption.},

	abstract = {To study the diversity and cultivar-specific of phytochemicals in sweet potato, Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry was used to analyze the metabolic profiles of five sweet potato cultivars exhibiting different flesh colors: purple, yellow/orange, and white. A total of 213 metabolites, including 29 flavonoids and 27 phenolic acids, were characterized. The flavonoid profiles of the five different cultivars were distinguished using PCA, the results suggested the flesh color accounted for the observed metabolic differences. In addition to anthocyanins, quinic acids and ferulic acids were the prominent phenolic acids, O-hexoside of quercetin, chrysoeriol were the prominent flavonoids in sweet potato tubers, and they were all higher in the OFSP and PFSP than WFSP. The main differential metabolic pathways between the OFSP, PFSP and the WFSP included those relating to phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis. This study provides new insights into the differences in metabolite profiles among sweet potatoes with different flesh colors.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are autonomous anticipatory oscillators that control a large array of physiological and metabolic processes. Compelling evidence points toward an interplay between circadian rhythms and cellular redox metabolism. Dysregulation of circadian rhythms is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and accelerated aging. Tea polyphenols (TP) is one of the most used antioxidants and exerts beneficial effect on neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate whether circadian clock mechanisms are involved in the protection effect of TP against neural redox imbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction in SH-SY5Y cells. In the current study, our results revealed that TP, as a Bmal1-enhancing natural compound, can reverse the relatively shallow daily oscillations of circadian clock genes transcription and protein expression in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells under oxidative stress conditions. Furthermore, TP pretreatment significantly ameliorated H2O2-elicited mitochondria impairment via manipulating mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial membrane potential, which is consistent with the recovery in expression of mitochondrial respiration complex I-IV in Bmal1-dependent efficiency. Furthermore, Bmal1 is involved in TP-stimulated Nrf2/ARE/HO-1 and AKT/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway. Hence, TP may serve as a nutritional preventive strategy in the recovery of oxidative stress-related neurodegenerative disease via modulating circadian clock.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythm plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis, and its disruption increases the risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Circadian rhythm is maintained by a central clock in the hypothalamus that is entrained by light, but circadian clocks are also present in peripheral tissues. These peripheral clocks are trained by other cues, such as diet. The aim of this study was to determine whether proanthocyanidins, the most abundant polyphenols in the human diet, modulate the expression of clock and clock-controlled genes in the liver, gut and mesenteric white adipose tissue (mWAT) in healthy and obese rats. Grape seed proanthocyanidin extracts (GSPEs) were administered for 21 days at 5, 25 or 50 mg GSPE/kg body weight in healthy rats and 25 mg GSPE/kg body weight in rats with diet-induced obesity. In healthy animals, GSPE administration led to the overexpression of core clock genes in a positive dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the acetylated BMAL1 protein ratio increased with the same pattern in the liver and mWAT. With regards to clock-controlled genes, Per2 was also overexpressed, whereas Rev-erbα and RORα were repressed in a negative dose-dependent manner. Diet-induced obesity always resulted in the overexpression of some core clock and clock-related genes, although the particular gene affected was tissue specific. GSPE administration counteracted disturbances in the clock genes in the liver and gut but was less effective in normalizing the clock gene disruption in WAT. In conclusion, proanthocyanidins have the capacity to modulate peripheral molecular clocks in both healthy and obese states.},

The effects of flavonoids on obesity and numerous diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's have been well studied. However, little is known about the relationships between flavonoids and the circadian clock. In this study, we show that continuous or transient application of flavonoids to the culture medium of embryonic fibroblasts from PER2::LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) mice induced various modifications in the circadian clock amplitude, period, and phase. Transient application of some of the tested flavonoids to cultured cells induced a phase delay of the PER2::LUC rhythm at the down slope phase. In addition, continuous application of the polymethoxy flavonoids nobiletin and tangeretin increased the amplitude and lengthened the period of the PER2::LUC rhythm. The nobiletin-induced phase delay was blocked by co-treatment with U0126, an ERK inhibitor. In summary, among the tested flavonoids, polymethoxy flavones increased the amplitude, lengthened the period, and delayed the phase of the PER2::LUC circadian rhythm. Therefore, foods that contain polymethoxy flavones may have beneficial effects on circadian rhythm disorders and jet lag.},

	issn = {1532-1983},
	doi = {10.1016/j.clnu.2018.04.006},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Physical inactivity is associated with lean body mass wasting, oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory changes of cell membrane lipids. Alkalinization may potentially counteract these alterations. We evaluated the effects of potassium bicarbonate supplementation on protein kinetics, glutathione status and pro- and anti-inflammatory polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in erythrocyte membranes in humans, during experimental bed rest.
METHODS: Healthy, young, male volunteers were investigated at the end of two 21-day bed rest periods, one with, and the other without, daily potassium bicarbonate supplementation (90 mmol × d-1), according to a cross-over design. Oxidative stress in erythrocytes was evaluated by determining the ratio between reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Glutathione turnover and phenylalanine kinetics, a marker of whole body protein metabolism, were determined by stable isotope infusions. Erythrocyte membranes PUFA composition was analyzed by gas-chromatography.
RESULTS: At the end of the two study periods, urinary pH was 10 ± 3\% greater in subjects receiving potassium bicarbonate supplementation (7.23 ± 0.15 vs. 6.68 ± 0.11, p {\textless} 0.001). Alkalinization increased total glutathione concentrations by 5 ± 2\% (p {\textless} 0.05) and decreased its rate of clearance by 38 ± 13\% (p {\textless} 0.05), without significantly changing GSH-to-GSSG ratio. After alkalinization, net protein balance in the postabsorptive state improved significantly by 17 ± 5\% (p {\textless} 0.05) as well as the sum of n-3 PUFA and the n-3-to-n-6 PUFA ratio in erythrocyte membranes (p {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Alkalinization during long-term inactivity is associated with improved glutathione status, anti-inflammatory lipid pattern in cell membranes and reduction in protein catabolism at whole body level. This study suggests that, in clinical conditions characterized by inactivity, oxidative stress and inflammation, alkalinization could be a useful adjuvant therapeutic strategy.},
