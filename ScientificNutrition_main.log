<p>ABSTRACT: In the US, 70% of pregnant women use an iron-containing prenatal supplement product; however, only 2.6% of pregnant women have iron-deficiency anemia and 16.3% are iron deficient. Yet, published data on the amounts and chemical forms of iron used in formulating these products are not available, although they are known to affect bioavailability. This information is especially important in comparing commercially available products with those that were tested in clinical trials. <strong>Our examination of nonprescription and prescription iron-containing prenatal supplement products in NIH&#39;s Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD) and DailyMed found the labeled amount of elemental iron ranged between 9 and 60 mg/serving in 148 nonprescription supplements and between 4.5 and 106 mg/serving in 101 prescription supplements. Ferrous fumarate was the preferred chemical form used in these products. In contrast, ferrous sulfate was the preferred chemical form of iron reported in the clinical trials summarized in a 2015 Cochrane Systematic review assessing the effects of daily oral iron supplements for pregnant women. Ferrous sulfate was not found on any prenatal supplement product label in the DSLD or DailyMed. The chemical forms of products on the market and those tested in clinical trials are dissimilar, and we believe this may have clinical implications.</strong> The findings raise several questions. Do outcomes in clinical trials correlate with the benefits and risks that might adhere to iron supplements with different iron formulations? Should the differences in chemical forms, their bioavailability, and safety profiles, be considered in greater depth when evaluating the effect of the various formulations on maternal iron nutriture? Should new clinical trials for pregnant and lactating women in the US use a form of iron not found in prenatal supplements sold in the US or should a more common form be used?</p>

<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/view-large/136381502">Table 2</a> has a good breakdown comparing clinical trial iron supplement forms to common dietary supplement forms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Table 2 shows that the chemical forms varied; 49% of the nonprescription and 44% of the prescription products used ferrous fumarate as the source of iron, 31% of the nonprescription and 14% of the prescription products used amino acid chelates, 5% of the nonprescription and 19% of the prescription products used carbonyl or elemental iron, and ∼25% used other or unspecified chemical forms. None used ferrous sulfate as the source of iron. The chemical forms also varied in the 61 studies reported in the 2015 Cochrane review (10); 59% used ferrous sulfate, 10% ferrous fumarate, 10% ferrous gluconate, and ∼21% other or unspecified chemical forms. Of the 8 studies conducted in the US, 80% used ferrous sulfate, 10% ferrous fumarate, and 10% ferrous gluconate.</p>

<p>Perhaps someone here has seen a good analysis of the various forms of supplemental iron (fumarate, sulfate, chelates, etc.)?</p>

in patients with metabolic syndrome</p>

<p>Abstract: Effects of berberine on glucose-lipid metabolism, inflammatory factors and insulin resistance in patients
with metabolic syndrome were investigated. Eighty patients
with metabolic syndrome treated in Linyi Central Hospital
from January 2017 to December 2017 were selected and
divided into control group (n=40) and observation group
(n=40). Patients in control group were treated with regular
therapy using the Western medicine and drugs, while those
in observation group, based on the treatment in control
group, were treated with berberine. Changes in relevant
indexes to blood glucose and lipid metabolisms and inflammatory factors were compared between the two groups.
The correlation of inflammatory factor with fasting blood
glucose, insulin resistance, triglyceride and total cholesterol
was analyzed. At 1 month after treatment, levels of fasting
blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose, insulin
resistance index and blood lipid indexes in both groups
were lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P&lt;0.05).
At 1 month after treatment, levels of fasting blood glucose,
2 h postprandial blood glucose, insulin resistance index and
blood lipid indexes in observation group were significantly
lower than those in control group during the same period
(P&lt;0.05). Moreover, levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α) in both groups at 1 month after treatment
were lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P&lt;0.05),
and they were lower in observation group at 1 month after
treatment than those in control group during the same period
(P&lt;0.05). Finally, hs-CRP was positively correlated with
fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol
and triglyceride. The combined application of berberine in
patients with metabolic syndrome can effectively regulate
blood glucose and blood lipid of patients, alleviate insulin
resistance and reduce the level of inflammatory response in
the body.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>

<p>Recommendations to use other criteria than N-balance for defining protein requirements have been proposed. However, little evidence to support other measures such as physiological functions is available.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE:</p>

<p>To investigate the effects of a usual (UP) versus a high protein (HP) diet on muscle function, cognitive function, quality of life and biochemical regulators of protein metabolism.</p>

<p>DESIGN:</p>

<p>A randomised intervention study was conducted with 23 healthy males (aged 19-31 yrs). All subjects consumed a Usual Protein (UP) diet (1.5 g protein/kg BW) for a 1-wk run-in period before the intervention period where they were assigned to either a UP or a High Protein (HP) diet (3.0 g protein/kg BW) for 3-wks with controlled intake of food and beverages. Blood and urine samples were taken along with measurements of physiological functions at baseline and at the end of the intervention period.</p>

<p>RESULTS:</p>

<p>The HP group improved their reaction time significantly compared with the UP group. Branched chain amino acids and phenylalanine in plasma were significantly increased following the HP diet, which may explain the improved reaction time.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION:</p>

<p>Healthy young males fed a HP diet improved reaction time. No adverse effects of the HP diet were observed.</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>1.5 g/kg is already a protein-replete diet so it&#39;s unsurprising that the results were so poor. Marginally significant improvements in 2 out of 19 tests with a decrement in 1 out of 19 while the normal protein group saw significant improvement in BMI that wasn&#39;t seen in the high protein group. They even replaced junk carbs (pasta, rice, bread and juice) but that didn&#39;t help much apparently.</p>

<p>I wonder if the Danish Meat Assocation is bummed they funded a study that couldn&#39;t come up with better outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>They tracked BMI but not body fat %, triglycerides, cholesterol, etc. Weird choice. Also, I’m amazed at how similar they were able to keep the nutrient intake (Table 3). High protein diet was somehow slightly lower in saturated fat than the lower protein diet</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>nice. thanks</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>But, they wanted to study the effects of a high-protein diet on overall physical and mental well-being, in comparison to a normal-protein diet. </p>

<p>They were not focussing on BMI changes / weight loss; which is why they enrolled people who were already in the healthy BMI range. The normal-protein group&#39;s BMI improvement is just an extra side-effect, which they can study in the future if they want to. </p>

<p>Since they wanted to study physical and mental wellbeing, they checked a variety of parameters (alertness, sustained attention, language, etc.); and, they found out that a high-protein diet is as good as a normal-protein diet.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I agree with most of what you said but I dont understand why you would consider the weight loss as an improvement of the BMI. I mean they are in the healthy range anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>At least they published it even though the results were unremarkable.</p>

<p>I agree that the healthy volunteers already were eating sufficient protein, I think the overage they consumed during the study was simply excreted.</p>

<p>3 Weeks isn&#39;t very long to see or not see side effects.  1.5g/kg seems pretty low and 3g of protein is fairly high.  Would be interesting to see results at 2-2.5g/kg and maybe study all three over a long period.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>1.5g/kg seems pretty low</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering that &quot;<a href="https://mennohenselmans.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/">1.8g/kg (0.82g/lb) is the point at which additional protein intake ceases to yield any benefits</a>&quot; for muscle building, I would consider 1.5 grams to be pretty high for a standard diet.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>But there are other benefits beyond muscle-building. Like, you won&#39;t build additional muscle beyond a certain point on a higher-protein diet, but you WILL realize body-composition benefits. Here&#39;s a link to an Examine.com link that supports intakes of 3.3g/kg of bodyweight: <a href="https://examine.com/nutrition/how-much-protein-do-you-need/">https://examine.com/nutrition/how-much-protein-do-you-need/</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>you WILL realize body-composition benefits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not quite.  As per the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Assuming progressive resistance overload and a mild hypercaloric diet (370–800 kcal above maintenance), a few studies suggest you’ll gain less fat if you eat more protein (3.3 g/kg rather than 1.8–2.6 g/kg), <strong>although one did not.</strong></p>

<p>What’s important to understand is that a daily protein intake of 3.3 g/kg isn’t likely to help you build more muscle than a daily protein intake of 1.8–2.6 g/kg. What the higher number can do is help you minimize the fat gains you’ll most likely experience <strong>if you eat above maintenance</strong> in order to gain (muscle) weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So IF you are an active bodybuilder or powerlifter and IF you are eating above maintenance then you <em>might</em> see benefits at those intake levels.  And unfortunately all of the extremely high protein intake research has only been done by Antonio, et al. so I am hesitant to put too much faith in it until it has been replicated by another research team.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Okay, let me re-word that for you:</p>

<p><em>More studies than not</em> suggest higher than .82g/lb <em>can</em> provide body composition benefits, whether bulking or sedentary, as well as greater muscle retention when cutting at a caloric deficit. 1.5g/kg is below optimal for most applications. 1.5 would not be considered &quot;high&quot; for the average diet.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>More studies than not suggest higher than .82g/lb can provide body composition benefits, whether bulking or sedentary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is is incorrect.  The Antonio studies were done on non-sedentary weight-training participants and the results of one of the two studies was insignificant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4715299/">there were no significant changes in body composition or markers of health in either group.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And while they did see benefits in the second study, their conclusions are also that high protein diets &#39;may&#39; infer benefits, not &#39;will&#39; infer benefits:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-015-0100-0">Consuming a high protein diet (3.4 g/kg/d) in conjunction with a heavy resistance-training program <strong>may</strong> confer benefits with regards to body composition.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3777747/">good study</a> on sedentary participants found no benefits equivalent to above 1.2 g/kg, and even the normal and high-protein group gained 50% of their weight as fat:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the regression line of protein intake and change in lean body mass, the protein intake required to prevent loss of lean body mass was 77.8 g/d (95% CI, 54.4–101.2 g/d)....The key finding of this study is that calories are more important than protein while consuming excess amounts of energy with respect to increases in body fat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And for: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>1.5g/kg is below optimal for most applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s actually only 0.1 g/kg below the maximal useful contribution to muscle building as suggested by <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/6/376">this 2018 meta-analysis</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Protein supplementation beyond total protein intakes of 1.62 g/kg/day resulted in no further RET-induced gains in FFM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is in weight-training individuals, which most of the population is not.</p>

<div class="md"><h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The debate on meat&#39;s role in health and disease is a rowdy and dissonant one. This study uses the health section of the online version of The Daily Mail as a case study to carry out a quantitative and qualitative reflection on the related discourses in mass media during the first fifteen years of the 21st century. This period ranged from the fall-out of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis and its associated food safety anxieties, over the Atkins diet-craze in 2003 and the avian flu episode in 2007, to the highly influential publication of the report on colon cancer by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2015. A variety of conflicting news items was discernible, whereby moments of crisis, depicting the potential hazards of meat eating, seemed to generate reassuring counter-reactions stressing the benefits of meat as a rich source of nutrients. In contrast, when the popularity of meat-rich diets was on the rise due to diets stressing the role of protein in weight control, several warnings were issued. Meat&#39;s long-standing and semiotic connotations of vitality, strength, and fertility were either confirmed, rejected or inverted. Often this was achieved through scientification or medicalisation, with references to nutritional studies. The holistic role of meat within human diets and health was thus mostly reduced to a focus on specific food components and isolated biological mechanisms. The narratives were often histrionic and displayed serious contradictions. Since several interests were at play, involving a variety of input from dieticians, (health) authorities, the food industry, vegan or vegetarian movements, and celebrities, the overall discourse was highly heterogeneous.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I was just looking at this paper the other day. </p>

<p>When translating these findings to humans, we have this study:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2673798/">Long-term effects of calorie or protein restriction on serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentration in humans</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reduced  function mutations in the insulin/IGF-I signaling pathway increase  maximal lifespan and health span in many species. <strong>Calorie restriction (CR) decreases serum IGF-1 concentration by ~40%, protects against  cancer and slows aging in rodents.</strong> However, the long-term effects of CR  with adequate nutrition on circulating IGF-1 levels in humans are  unknown. Here we report data from two long-term CR studies (1 and 6  years) showing that <strong>severe CR without malnutrition did not change IGF-1  and IGF-1 : IGFBP-3 ratio levels in humans. In contrast, total and free  IGF-1 concentrations were significantly lower in moderately  protein-restricted individuals. Reducing protein intake from an average  of 1.67 g kg −1 of body weight per day to 0.95 g kg −1 of body weight per day for 3 weeks in six volunteers practicing CR resulted in a reduction in serum IGF-1 from 194 ng mL −1 to 152 ng mL −1</strong>. These findings demonstrate that, unlike in rodents, long-term severe  CR does not reduce serum IGF-1 concentration and IGF-1 : IGFBP-3 ratio  in humans. In addition, our data provide evidence that protein intake is  a key determinant of circulating IGF-1 levels in humans, and suggest  that reduced protein intake may become an important component of  anticancer and anti-aging dietary interventions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rodents on CR at any level of protein experience a 40% reduction in IGF-1, while human CR practitioners eating high protein (about 24%) had IGF-1 levels no different from BMI 25, Western diet controls. When reducing protein from 1.67 g/kg to 0.95 g/kg their IGF-1 dropped 25% to 150 ng/mL. A group of mostly raw food vegans with higher BMI and body fat eating 0.74 g/kg protein had IGF-1 levels below 150 ng/mL without calorie restriction.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, after the results of this study came out, the CR practitioners changed their diets to low protein (around the RDA), moderate methionine, with protein mostly from plants.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><h2>Highlights</h2>

<p>• Calorie restriction (CR) and protein restriction (PR) both have a positive effect on lifespan</p>

<p>• In rodents the effect of CR on lifespan is not explained by the simultaneous restriction of protein</p>

<p>• The response in mammals to CR and PR appears to be different to that in insects</p>

<p>• The key difference may be methodological, as insect studies generally involve dietary dilution as opposed to restriction. Caloric restriction may generate fundamentally different responses to calorie dilution</p>

<p>• We suggest future studies should adopt these different terms – Caloric restriction and Caloric dilution to accurately describe their experimental protocols</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Almost exactly 100 years ago Osborne and colleagues demonstrated that restricting the food intake of a small number of female rats extended their lifespan. In the 1930s experiments on the impact of diet on lifespan were extended by Slonaker, and subsequently McCay. Slonaker concluded that there was a strong impact of protein intake on lifespan, while McCay concluded that calories are the main factor causing differences in lifespan when animals are restricted (Calorie restriction or CR). Hence from the very beginning the question of whether food restriction acts on lifespan <em>via</em>reduced calorie intake or reduced protein intake was disputed. Subsequent work supported the idea that calories were the dominant factor. More recently, however, this role has again been questioned, particularly in studies of insects. Here we review the data regarding previous studies of protein and calorie restriction in rodents. We show that increasing CR (with simultaneous protein restriction: PR) increases lifespan, and that CR with no PR generates an identical effect. None of the residual variation in the impact of CR (with PR) on lifespan could be traced to variation in macronutrient content of the diet. Other studies show that low protein content in the diet does increase median lifespan, but the effect is smaller than the CR effect. We conclude that CR is a valid phenomenon in rodents that cannot be explained by changes in protein intake, but that there is a separate phenomenon linking protein intake to lifespan, which acts over a different range of protein intakes than is typical in CR studies. This suggests there may be a fundamental difference in the responses of insects and rodents to CR. This may be traced to differences in the physiology of these groups, or reflect a major methodological difference between ‘restriction’ studies performed on rodents and insects. We suggest that studies where the diet is supplied <em>ad libitum</em>, but diluted with inert components, should perhaps be called dietary or caloric dilution, rather than dietary or caloric restriction, to distinguish these potentially important methodological differences.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Second interesting thing: The weirdest part of the OP paper (Speakman) is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We suggest that studies where the diet is supplied <em>ad libitum</em>, but diluted with inert components, should perhaps be called dietary or caloric dilution, rather than dietary or caloric restriction, to  distinguish these potentially important methodological differences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Expanded here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A possible explanation for the unusual response of the mice studied by Solon-Biet et al. (2014) was the manner in which the restriction was applied, which was exceptional among studies of rodents (Solon-Bietet al., 2014). In all previous studies of CR in rodents, the subject animals are given a ration of food that is lower than the intake of an ad libitum fed control group. Details of the exact protocols vary, in particular when and how frequently the ration is delivered (reviewed in Speakman and Mitchell, 2011) but they all have in common a shortfall in the quantity (i.e.mass) of food eaten, relative toad libitum fed animals. In contrast, Solon-Biet et al. (2014)generated restriction by diluting the diet with indigestible cellulose. Hence, while the mice ingested fewer calories, they did so while ingesting almost twice as much mass of food (Solon-Biet et al., 2014). This difference may be critical, because a potentially key component of the response to CR is a stimulation of the hunger signalling pathways in the brain (Hambly et al., 2007, 2012;Lusseau et al., 2015). When components of these pathways are knocked out, the response to CR is attenuated (e.g.NPY null mice). Diluting the diet, rather than restricting the amount available, may potentially generate fundamentally different responses in the neuropeptide pathways that link restriction to its beneficial actions with respect to lifespan(Lusseau et al., 2015). For example, the patterns of response in gut hormones that regulate satiation and satiety, and direct vagal afferents that respond to gut distension,are likely to be very different in mice that are underfed, compared to those that voluntarily overeat a diluted diet. Indeed, the fact the animals fed the diluted diet do not completely compensate for the caloric deficit, in the presence of excess food, suggests that hunger signalling pathways are down- rather than up-regulated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s basically saying that if you (a mouse) calorie restrict, but eat a high fiber diet that is satiating instead of feeling constant hunger, CR does not work. But this hypothesis is based on only one study, and one mechanism - neuropeptide Y - with some evidence that it may attenuate the response to CR in mice.</p>

<p>The study (<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(14/">Solon et al 2014</a>00065-5#secsectitle0030)) tested 10 different diets with varying protein, carbohydrate, and fat content, further altered by adding indigestible fiber to some of the diets to decrease energy density for a total of 25 diets. They fed the diets ad-libitum and measured how much the mice ate, then how long they lived.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consequently, total energy intake was highest on those diets with low  protein and/or low carbohydrate content because compensatory overeating  to achieve the protein or carbohydrate intake targets was not counterbalanced by marked inhibitory effects of fat on total food intake.  </p>

<p>At 6 and 15 months, mice ate similar amounts of protein regardless of  the energy density of the diet, consistent with regulation to a protein intake target. However, at 24 months, which represents old age, mice ate  similar amounts of food regardless of the energy density of their  diets. This led to a reduction in the intake of energy and macronutrients in the old mice on the low-energy density diets and, conversely, increased intakes in old mice on high-energy density diets (<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(14">Figure S2</a>00065-5#app2)D).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the mice were not CR&#39;d, they were eating ad-lib, which meant that the low-protein mice ate more calories overall because of protein leverage. The high-fiber diets didn&#39;t decrease calorie intake at all in young mice, but they did in old mice; and the high fiber diets had the worst longevity regardless of macronutrient content - maybe because the mice couldn&#39;t eat enough when they got old? And this is what Speakman&#39;s analysis of no longevity benefit is based on. Finally, despite eating more calories in youth, the low-protein (but medium or high energy density) mice lived the longest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Median lifespan was greatest for animals whose intakes were low in protein and high in carbohydrate, but was not influenced by total calorie intake</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I think this calorie dilution thing is a very long shot.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Wait... Can you explain this? Reducing protein consumption, even with 0 reduction in total calorie consumption, results in a drop in IGF-1 levels?? This is wild, can you tl;dr a bit? Or link for a layperson?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Anecdotally, after the results of this study came out, the CR practitioners changed their diets to low protein (around the RDA), moderate methionine, with protein mostly from plants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m wondering if anyone has adapted similar dietary pattern but on the ketogenic side and using animal protein instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Well, the vegan group in the human study did eat fewer calories than the control group of nearly overweight people on a Western diet. Calories avg of 1980/day, Western diet 2505/day, calorie-restriction diet 1772/day. BMI&#39;s of each group: raw vegans 21-22, CR 19.8, Western 25. So this study involves both calories and protein, but it shows that even a severe calorie restriction won&#39;t lower IGF-1 if there&#39;s too much protein, and a mild amount of CR plus a low protein plant based diet achieved what some consider optimal IGF-1 for anti-aging.</p>

<p>There are more studies, like:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988204/">Low Protein Intake is Associated with a Major Reduction in IGF-1, Cancer, and Overall Mortality in the 65 and Younger but Not Older Population</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16965238">Effects of a low-fat, high-fiber diet and exercise program on breast cancer risk factors</a></p>

<p><a href="http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/11/11/1441">The Associations of Diet with Serum Insulin-like Growth Factor I and Its Main Binding Proteins in 292 Women Meat-Eaters, Vegetarians, and Vegans</a></p>

<p>The last one again compared vegans with meat eaters and found lower IGF-1 levels. </p>

<p>The summary is, different proteins have different ratios of the amino acids, and this determines how much they increase IGF-1 (I believe <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23216249">leucine</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22442749">does</a> so the most). Thus, lower protein overall will decrease IGF-1, but so will replacement with less anabolic protein sources. I think casein (a milk protein) stimulates IGF-1 the most, and plant proteins on average stimulate it less than animal proteins/also seem to upregulate another molecule that binds to IGF-1 and inactivates it (therefore a dietary switch from animal to plant reduces serum IGF-1).</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>“ABSTRACT</p>

<p>Background
Dietary recommendations to limit red meat are based on observational studies linking intake to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk together with the potential of its saturated fatty acid (SFA) content to raise low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. However, the relation of white meat to CVD risk, and the effects of dietary protein source on lipoprotein particle subfractions, have not been extensively evaluated.</p>

<p>Objective
We tested whether levels of atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins differed significantly following consumption of diets with high red meat content compared with diets with similar amounts of protein derived from white meat or nonmeat sources, and whether these effects were modified by concomitant intake of high compared with low SFAs.</p>

<p>Methods
Generally healthy men and women, 21–65 y, body mass index 20–35 kg/m2, were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 parallel arms (high or low SFA) and within each, allocated to red meat, white meat, and nonmeat protein diets consumed for 4 wk each in random order. The primary outcomes were LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apoB), small + medium LDL particles, and total/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.</p>

<p>Results
Analysis included participants who completed all 3 dietary protein assignments (61 for high SFA; 52 for low SFA). LDL cholesterol and apoB were higher with red and white meat than with nonmeat, independent of SFA content (P &lt; 0.0001 for all, except apoB: red meat compared with nonmeat [P = 0.0004]). This was due primarily to increases in large LDL particles, whereas small + medium LDL and total/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were unaffected by protein source (P = 0.10 and P = 0.51, respectively). Primary outcomes did not differ significantly between red and white meat. Independent of protein source, high compared with low SFA increased LDL cholesterol (P = 0.0003), apoB (P = 0.0002), and large LDL (P = 0.0002).</p>

<p>Conclusions
The findings are in keeping with recommendations promoting diets with a high proportion of plant-based food but, based on lipid and lipoprotein effects, do not provide evidence for choosing white over red meat for reducing CVD risk.”</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hypothesis: &quot;Our primary  hypothesis was that on a high-SFA diet, red meat relative to other sources of protein would increase serum concentrations of LDL cholesterol, apoB, small and medium LDL particles, and the ratio of total/HDL cholesterol&quot;</p>

<p>Result: &quot;LDL cholesterol and apoB were higher with red and white meat than with nonmeat, independent of SFA content (P&lt;0.0001 for all,except apoB: red meat compared with nonmeat [P=0.0004]). This was due primarily to increases in large LDL particles, whereas small+medium LDL and total/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were unaffected by protein source (P=0.10 andP=0.51,respectively). Primary outcomes did not differ significantly between red and white meat. Independent of protein source, high compared with low SFA increased LDL cholesterol (P=0.0003), apoB(P=0.0002), and large LDL (P=0.0002).&quot;</p>

<p>The primary difference seems to be in large LDL, but the ARIC study has shown that increase of lb-LDL-C (non-SD-LDL) has 0 correlation with CHD: 2014 Small Dense LDL Cholesterol Concentrations Predict Risk for Coronary Heart Disease: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3999643/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3999643/</a> (see Fig 1 for easy reference). I&#39;m unsure what the justification of the conclusion is if there is not relevant difference in risk factors in that case.</p>

<p>Also, while LDL was lower based on protein, based on Table 3, so was HDL, resulting in apoB/apoA and TC/HDL ratios being the same (and the latter isn&#39;t significant based on protein source). Although there&#39;s a good P value for most of these, the SD variances are huge so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really possible to tease out much useful w/o the raw data. Table 4 does a better job of illustrating how minimal the differences are with particle counts or particle sizes.  If you had the raw data I think it might be interesting to plug the results into CVD risk calculators and see if there were any change in the results (I&#39;m sure they took weight and BP). In the abstract conclusion and the discussion the authors seems to make a much stronger position than seems warranted.</p>

<p>Interesting notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>All diets had about 40% carbs, 35% fat (interestingly, the main difference from baseline was just swapping 10% less carb for 10% more protein) - this is perhaps a good fit for those working within the parameters of the SAD, but this macronutrient mix probably doesn&#39;t shine any light when looking at high fat in relation to much lower-carb (or fat) consumption patterns.</li>
<li> I don&#39;t think the data is very well laid out as there isn&#39;t anything clearly showing changes from baseline to the various diets. You have to manually track the data between Table 1 and Table 2 (it also doesn&#39;t give data between washout periods - these were collected since they were adjusted for, but IMO, this makes it much harder than it should be to read). When do you do a comparison, it appears all dietary changes improved TC/HDL ratios (was it the -10%CHO? +10%PRO, change in food quality?).</li>
<li>All groups had 7% PRO from dairy, 2% PRO from egg; all cuts of meat were &quot;lean&quot;, grain-finished meat was used to better represent US meat consumption and fish was excluded to avoid confounding effects of n3 consumption. Low-SFA nonmeat had 20% more fiber than the other meals.</li>
<li>Ends with mentioning that there wasn&#39;t testing on atherogenic lipoprotein indices or clinical CVD outcomes looked at (the latter is understandable considering how short term the trial was, the former seems like a major shortcoming considering the study wants to draw conclusion of CVD benefit, but even my cursory look seems to question what those are).</li>
</ul>

<p>My conclusion: paper saved as another data point, but doesn&#39;t really say much interesting IMO.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Does anyone have access to the actual article? I&#39;m curious as to what specific diets they&#39;re using here. Some questions I have:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>is fiber kept constant between the three diets, or are the meat diets reduced fiber as a result of incorporating meat without increasing fiber elsewhere? Are macros in general kept constant?</p></li>
<li><p>How much meat is incorporated into the meat diet? Are they aiming for all (or a vast majority) of protein to come from meat, or does meat still represent a minority protein source?</p></li>
<li><p>what protein sources are they using in the plant based diet? Do we know what role nuts and legumes play in the diet used here?</p></li>
<li><p>How are &quot;red&quot; and &quot;white&quot; meats defined here? What particular animals are the white and red meat groups consuming?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Does this convince anyone to reduce their meat intake?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>No offence, but this seems heavily vegan biased. This isn&#39;t a real comparison study either, if you&#39;re including high saturated fat meats with high amounts of carbs vs low (I mean keto level not garbage 30% carbs) then we&#39;d probably see a different story over a LONGER period of time. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>This type of stuff needs to stop, there&#39;s an obvious agenda here and it benefits very few people.</p>

Is my interpretation incorrect?</p>

<p>When you control for saturated fat intake, red meat and white meat consumption have the same effect on cholesterol, which is higher than vegetable protein consumption. But it doesn&#39;t matter because as the  researchers noted, &quot;higher concentrations of LDL cholesterol...are primarily attributable to increases in <strong>large, cholesterol-rich LDL particles</strong>...and as summarized elsewhere (34, 35), <strong>large LDL particles</strong>, measured by  several different methodologies, <strong>have not been associated with CVD in multiple population cohorts in contrast to the associations observed for concentrations of medium, small, and/or very small LDL</strong> (26,  36–38)...and Thus, the estimated impact of red meat, white meat, and dairy-derived SFA on CVD risk as  reflected by their effects on LDL cholesterol and apoB  concentrations may be attenuated by the lack of their effects on smaller LDL particles that are most strongly associated with CVD.&quot;</p>

<p>What about his 2011 study ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Changes in atherogenic dyslipidemia induced by carbohydrate restriction in men are dependent on dietary protein source.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that multiple features of atherogenic dyslipidemia are improved by replacement of dietary carbohydrate with mixed sources of protein and that these lipid and lipoprotein changes are independent of dietary saturated fat content. Because epidemiological evidence suggests that red meat intake may adversely affect cardiovascular disease risk, we tested the effects of replacing dietary carbohydrate with beef protein in the context of high- vs. low-saturated fat intake in 40 healthy men. After a 3-wk baseline diet [50% daily energy (E) as carbohydrate, 13% E as protein, 15% E as saturated fat], participants consumed for 3 wk each in a randomized crossover design two high-beef diets in which protein replaced carbohydrate (31% E as carbohydrate, 31% E as protein, with 10% E as beef protein). The high-beef diets differed in saturated fat content (8% E vs. 15% E with exchange of saturated for monounsaturated fat). Two-week washout periods were included following the baseline diet period and between the randomized diets periods. Plasma TG concentrations were reduced after the 2 lower carbohydrate dietary periods relative to after the baseline diet period and these reductions were independent of saturated fat intake. <strong>Plasma total, LDL, and non-HDL cholesterol as well as apoB concentrations were lower after the low-carbohydrate, low-saturated fat diet period than after the low-carbohydrate, high-saturated fat diet period</strong>. Given our previous observations with mixed protein diets, the present findings raise the possibility that dietary protein source may modify the effects of saturated fat on atherogenic lipoproteins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was 30% carbohydrate but do you have evidence that it&#39;s different for a ketogenic diet?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Krauss a vegan? Are you aware of the funding he typically receives? A single google search would have shown how ridiculous that statement is. Even if he was funded by big broccoli instead of the animal agriculture industry I feel like this sub should actually review the methodology and results instead of making up reasons to dismiss a study.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The primary agenda of the study is to evaluate red meat vs. white meat, and finds there is very little difference between the two.  How does that &#39;benefit veganism&#39;?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The carbs in the study were carefully chosen and remained constant throughout the study both in total amounts and as a mixture of complex and simple carbs.  This study isn&#39;t designed to test fat based ketogenic diets.  It&#39;s to test protein sources in the context of a diet that closely resembles something an individual might eat on a regular basis.  If anything, reconstructing this diet to a high fat ketogenic diet would be less useful because it would apply to a very small segment of the population that follows a very peculiar diet practice.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Your comments really make no sense in the context of this study or Dr. Krauss historical work, as he&#39;s been previously funded by the beef industry and dairy council.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Interesting, I&#39;ll have to take a closer look at the MESA analysis, although it&#39;s worth noting that they don&#39;t necessarily conflict. The 2007 paper you referenced is specifically looking at analysis of MESA data for CIMT/subclinical atherosclerosis, while the initially referenced 2014 ARIC study results were focused on CHD endpoints.</p>

<p>While meta-analysis and systematic reviews can be useful, I also think care is needed as they are usually not as final,  conclusive, or unbiased as people might think. For example, the one you reference (which I haven&#39;t read, will queue it up) is coming from one institution, published in a non lipidology/cardiology journal, and is older (2009) in a rapidly evolving field. Here&#39;s a better overview article that shows clear differences amongst use of differing risk markers that you may find of interest: </p>

<p>Davidson, Michael H., Christie M. Ballantyne, Terry A. Jacobson, Vera A. Bittner, Lynne T. Braun, Alan S. Brown, W.Virgil Brown, et al. “Clinical Utility of Inflammatory Markers and Advanced Lipoprotein Testing: Advice from an Expert Panel of Lipid Specialists.” <em>Journal of Clinical Lipidology</em> 5, no. 5 (September 2011): 338–67. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacl.2011.07.005">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacl.2011.07.005</a>.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s also worth consideration that &quot;best predictor&quot; may also not actually count for much. For example, in this recent (2018) analysis with risk prediction vs actual (CAC scored CVD), it showed (Fig 1) that ~40% of the normolipidemia group had calcification (vs 55% of the hypercholesterolemia group). This seems to bear out in other studies: <a href="http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/70/24/2979">http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/70/24/2979</a></p>

<p>&quot;Subclinical atherosclerosis (plaque or coronary artery calcification) was present in 49.7% of CVRF-free participants.&quot;</p>

<p>WRT to studies on ketogenic diets and apoB (apoB/apoA *ratio* btw seems to be the relevant risk marker, not apoB measures alone), I haven&#39;t run across any studies focused on that specifically, but we know that CVD is multifactorial, and I think it&#39;s still safe to say, that if anyone&#39;s particularly interested in not dying of CHD rather than getting too worried about LDL, focusing on improving something like the deadly quartet via lifestyle modification is probably a better way to go: <a href="https://www.daxor.com/pdfs/quartet.pdf">https://www.daxor.com/pdfs/quartet.pdf</a></p>

<p>Note that that quartet is basically MetS and we can see then why CHD results seem to not improved despite the hundred billion dollars of statins prescribed: <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105">https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105</a></p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks for those links!</p>

<p>As for your first one, they seem to be in agreement with what I am saying?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LDL subfractions: initial clinical assessmentand on-treatment management decisions1. </p>

<p>In patients with low risk (,5% 10-year CHD event risk), intermediate risk (5%–20% 10-year CHD event risk), CHD or CHD risk equivalent, premature family history of CHD in the absence of other risk factors, and in patients with established CHD who experience recurrent events despite appropriate therapy there is insufficient evidence to support LDL subfraction measurement for initial clinical assessment or on-treatment management decisions (rating: ‘‘not recommended’’).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Studies have linked large LDL particles to atherosclerosis in nonhuman primates,213 in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (who have an elevated concentration of predominantly large LDL particles),214 in participants of the population-based MESA study,215 in normolipidemic men with CHD,216 and among patients after MIin  the  Cholesterol  And  Recurrent  Events  (CARE)study.21</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the physiological rationale for the linkbetween LDL subfractions and adverse CVoutcome?</p>

<p><strong>All  lipoprotein  particles  in  the  LDL  fraction  are atherogenic, independent of size</strong>. LDL particles become trapped in the arterial wall and are internalized by macrophages through scavenger receptors on the macrophage surface, resulting in foam cell formation, activation of these foam cells and expansion of the inflammatory response.223 It has been proposed that small, dense LDL particles are more atherogenic than larger particles due to longer residence time in plasma, increased susceptibility to oxidation, enhanced arterial proteoglycan binding, and increased permeability through the endothelial barrier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which part of the paper do you think show that only small dense LDL-subfraction matter? I might have skip it. </p>

<p>As for the second paper, I know some people might not agree with this conclusion, but given that <em>normal</em> cholesterol level for non-westernized human should is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15172426">around 120mg/dl</a>, it could be that what is currently considered good is still too high.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(apoB/apoA <em>ratio</em> btw seems to be the relevant risk marker, not apoB measures alone)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d say this is probably true in people with metabolic syndrome, but in the healthy general population, apoB through LDL-p seem to catch most of the risk. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>focusing on improving something like the deadly quartet via lifestyle modification is probably a better way to go:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No disagreement from me, but I see no good reason to not also make sure that my LDL level is not higher than it needs to be. My lifestyle choices do not cause obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia or hyperlipidemia. I don&#39;t any to chose between any of that, I can take care of all of it at the same time. If one wants to do keto, why not do a more plant-based version of it? Althought it&#39;s much harder and probably not as satisfying. I can&#39;t see the rationnal for going heavy on the animal product and accept high LDL-c/p level.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Are you sure about that? The authors of this study seem to disagree. Am I misreading this?</p>

<p>&quot;In particular, as summarized elsewhere (34, 35), large LDL particles, measured by several different  methodologies, have not been associated with CVD in multiple population cohorts in contrast to the associations observed for concentrations of medium, small, and/or very small LDL (26, 36–38).&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I’ve noticed lots of people says it’s all inflammation which is ridiculous. It certainly plays a role and was once a decent sounding hypothesis but lots of studies have since come out disproving it as the central driver. Every cardiovascular researcher I’ve talked to said blaming inflammation is far far too simplistic.</p>

<div class="md"><p>&quot;LDL cholesterol and apoB were higher with red and white meat than with nonmeat, independent of SFA content (P &lt; 0.0001 for all, except apoB: red meat compared with nonmeat [P = 0.0004]).&quot; </p>

<p>What is your Interpretation of their findings? it shows that a vegetarian diet decreases LDL Cholesterol or doesnt it?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Re: subfractions, I think the point specifically lies with LDL-C not being a great predictor/being contextual and other markers having more specificity. This is consistent with what we&#39;re seeing in terms of CVD and low LDL (this extends to coronary events as well, not just subclinical AS). And also from observations as far back as 2001: Low Triglycerides–High High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Risk of Ischemic Heart Disease <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/647239">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/647239</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Men with conventional risk factors for IHD have a low risk of IHD if they have low TG–high HDL-C levels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fig 1 is a great illustration of the very marginal improvements in CV risk across most of the major CV trials comparing event rates for those that have had interventional LDL-lowering and those that don&#39;t: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3697085/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3697085/</a> - it reflects some of the other studies I&#39;ve pointed to that shows that CVD happens irrespective of LDL levels.</p>

<p>The opposite also happens to be true if LDL is high but other markers are good. Eg 2016 Role of Coronary Artery Calcium Score of Zero and Other Negative Risk Markers for Cardiovascular Disease: The Multi-Ethnic Study Of Atherosclerosis (MESA)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Negative results of atherosclerosis-imaging tests, particularly CAC=0, resulted in the greatest downward shift in estimated CVD risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or in 2018 Impact of Statins on Cardiovascular Outcomes Following Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring <a href="http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/early/2018/10/31/j.jacc.2018.09.051">http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/early/2018/10/31/j.jacc.2018.09.051</a>), where you can see that if CAC is zero, there&#39;s no impact on of LDL-lowering.</p>

<p>With regards of talking about non-MetS populations, I think it&#39;s an open question, but in practice, very few metabolically healthy individuals are going to have CVD-related mortality anyway, but the flip side seems more relevant considering that per that 2018 NHANES data analysis cited, that 70% have MetS under ATP III, and only 12% are &quot;metabolically optimal.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not particularly interested in convincing anyone of doing anything (besides critically reading the full-text of research published and putting it into context of what else they&#39;ve read, please do that!) but having gone through a fair share of my own research and drastically improving my personal health (I&#39;m in that 12% now, but I wasn&#39;t before), my general feeling about LDL is that it&#39;s a white rabbit that public/nutritional/medical health experts have been chasing for the past 50 years to the extreme detriment of almost every other metabolic health marker. I think that it&#39;s fine to have a low LDL, but there is also suggestive evidence that having high LDL wasn&#39;t a problem in the past, and may actually be beneficial, especially as people age. Eg this review, 2016 Lack of an association or an inverse association between low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and mortality in the elderly: a systematic review <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/6/6/e010401.full.pdf">https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/6/6/e010401.full.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>High LDL-C is inversely associated with mortality in most people over 60 years. This finding is inconsistent with the cholesterol hypothesis (ie, that cholesterol, particularly LDL-C, is inherently atherogenic). Since elderly people with high LDL-C live as long or longer than those with low LDL-C, our analysis provides reason to question the validity of the cholesterol hypothesis. Moreover, our study provides the rationale for a re-evaluation of guidelines recommending pharmacological reduction of LDL-C in the elderly as a component of cardiovascular disease prevention strategies.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It’s more of a theoretical argument. Any lipoprotein has the potential to enter the epithelium, theoretically. But I have yet to see any substantial evidence that I should be too worried about large LDL.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The simple answer is processed food is to blame. Inflammation, lipids, genetics, magic, or whatever you want to say the driving factor is, it&#39;s all because of bad food and poor lifestyle. Eat real whole food like fruits, veggies, and unprocessed meat bought raw. For bonus health lead a fasting focused lifestyle. Limit your stress and be happy.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Do you consider LDL-c irrelevant to the pathology or that there are other risk factors besides LDL-c? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the point specifically lies with LDL-C not being a great predictor/being contextual and other markers having more specificity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which markers do you have in mind? </p>

<p>From your first link </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There seems to be substantial biological support for our finding that a low TG–high HDL-C concentration is associated with a very low risk of IHD, whereas a high TG–low HDL-C concentration is a central risk factor of IHD. We think that our results should be considered with special reference to the absence or presence of the metabolic syndrome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>low hdl/high trig is the classic hallmark of metabolic syndrome. I think everybody would agree that suffering from it will increase your chance of CHD. Yet, what is one of the proposed mechanism (not the only one)? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The metabolic syndrome with high TG–low HDL-C concentrations has an effect on LDL particle size, density distribution, and composition, leading to a smaller and denser LDL particle22,23 that is more easily oxidized24 and thus much more atherogenic.25,26 The metabolic syndrome with high TG–low HDL-C concentrations includes an increased amount of TG-rich lipoproteins, some of which are very atherogenic, leading to progression of coronary artery lesions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it still come back to having elevated atherogenic lipoproteins, which appear to be a core requirement for atherosclerosis to happen. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s one thing if someone choose to believe that his LDL-c level are irrelevant because he is otherwise metabolicaly healthy, but the fact is that we have very little data to invalidate or confirm this and we have substantial evidence that high LDL-c is atherogenic. Again, I see no reason personally to accept high LDL-c/p level, and this is why on a population level we&#39;re nowhere close to see those recommendation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eg this review</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/192897">when we follow people for long-enough</a>, low-cholesterol level is linked to increase longevity and decreased CHD incidence.  </p>

<div class="md"><p>Processing a food doesn’t inherently make it bad. What specific effect of processing is harmful?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>As you mention, there isn&#39;t so much data that is specifically disentangling when LDL-C levels are of concern (although the research with high HDL and low TGs are suggestive and point towards a consistent explanation of damage only being an issue when there is an inbalance of efflux and damaged (sd, ox) LDL) so we&#39;ll just have to wait and see for more definitive research, but to flip your question on its head - per your belief in the lipid hypothesis, if you could lower LDL-C alone, then there should be a significant effect on CVD, correct?</p>

<p>What if I told you that there was a class of drugs that could not only significantly decreased LDL-C but also significantly increased HDL-C with no benefit? In that case, that would mean that treating LDL-C as root cause, and not simply a marker or part of a symptom of a larger problem would be false, or at least extremely problematic? (I&#39;d hop so) Because this has actually been studied extensively (and I&#39;m not just talking about in the statin trials, although you&#39;d also expect a much larger result there as well). But there&#39;s a whole class of drugs, CETPs that does exactly this and has never been brought to market because it is wholly (rather than in the case of statins, as previously cited, only conditionally) effective.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;ll give you the full citation on these since this is worth a full read/chasing down (including references) if you are truly interested in digging into the rabbit hole, as these are results from a Phase III trial where there should be every incentive to find any excuse for this to be effective, and yet: Eyvazian, Vaughn A., and William H. Frishman. “Evacetrapib: Another CETP Inhibitor for Dyslipidemia with No Clinical Benefit.” <em>Cardiology in Review</em>, January 2017, 1. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/CRD.0000000000000137">https://doi.org/10.1097/CRD.0000000000000137</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evacetrapib  acts to decrease lipid exchange through CETP inhibition. CETP acts to  transfer cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol  (HDL-C) to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and  very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-C). HDL-C is involved in reverse cholesterol transport  and its blood levels have been shown to be inversely correlated with  cardiovascular risk. Thus, a pharmacologic agent that can elevate HDL-C  has been seen as an exciting area of research. In recent studies, evacetrapib  was shown to be safe and efficacious. It produced an increase in HDL-C  up to 128% and a 35% decrease in LDL-C, in comparison to placebo. In  addition, evacetrapib was also shown to be more potent than previous CETP inhibitors. HDL-C particles treated with evacetrapib  remained functional and had improved cholesterol efflux. A previously  studied CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, exhibited side effects of  hyperaldosteronism, manifesting in electrolyte disturbances, and  hypertension. These detrimental effects were not seen with evacetrapib. Recently, the results of evacetrapib’s  phase III ACCELERATE trial showed no significant reduction in major  adverse cardiovascular events or mortality, and the drug will not be  marketed.</p>

<p>Depending on how LDL is lowered, yes, there should be. Just chasing low number regardless of how its achieved would be shortsighted. </p>

<p>CETP inhibitor are a good example. Drugs can have unknown adverse effect that will confound the result. </p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5594181/">commentary</a> explaining why evacetrapib might not have work. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1706444">A more recent trial</a> using another CETP inhibitor did find that it decrease CHD events. </p>

<p>What about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26780009">mendelian</a> study?</p>

<p>I feel the evidence converge pretty nicely all in the same direction, ie cholesterol level matter. </p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>&gt; Depending on how LDL is lowered, yes, there should be. Just chasing low  number regardless of how its achieved would be shortsighted.</p>

<p>OK, great, I think we can agree on that. Where we still differ, I think reasonable people can disagree depending on their take on the data, which is still developing, although I increasingly fall in the Ravnskov as I read more.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already cited the weaknesses of statins in terms of the effectiveness of the LDL-lowering (very effective) to CHD endpoints (very ineffective) or for primary prevention when there is not CVD (completely ineffective)! To me, this along with the CETP results mentioned simply underline that to lowering LDL-C dramatically simply does not have the effect you&#39;d expect if LDL-C was actually driving CHD (we&#39;ll see where PCKS9 leads - the studies show of course its even more dramatically capable of lowering LDL - lets see where the hard endpoints end up, especially as all studies show all-cause mortality increasing at the low physiologic levels).</p>

<p>In terms of why do statins work at all? I think there are a few things - statins does not just lower circulating LDL, but also lowers LDL transit times, which would reduce damaged sdLDL and oxLDL buildup. This seems pretty plausible within the multifactorial framework for CVD. Secondarily, we know that statins are anti-inflammatory agents, and there&#39;s been much recent research considering that (the chronic endothelial injury hypothesis is the other leading theory on CVD, which IMO actually ties in quite nicely with the parts of the lipid hypothesis that we&#39;ve observed to be true). It very neatly explains why high or low LDL-C can cause CVD, and, taking it back to where it started, neatly explains Krauss&#39;s observations on phenotype A vs B and all the subfraction results we&#39;ve seen. LDL-C in this lens is only predictive to the point where it accurately accounts for damaged LDL&#39;s ability to enter the endothilial layer and overwhelming the body&#39;s ability to extract it.</p>

<p>I think the real question is actually, why aren&#39;t statins <em>more</em> effective? It&#39;s very effective at lowering LDL-C, and Lipitor was the world&#39;s best selling drug. Besides the cross-sectional endpoint study already cited, I think that this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25672965">Diamond and Ravnskov</a> piece that kicked off my interest in this question is some worthwhile reading onthe topic. On JUPITER:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the public and healthcare workers were informed of a 54% reduction of heart attacks when the actual effect in the treated population was a reduction of less than 1 percentage point. Moreover, the ARR of 0.41 percentage points was the combination of fatal and nonfatal heart attacks. There was little attention paid to the fact that more people had died from a heart attack in the treatment group. Even experienced researchers may have overlooked this finding because the figures were not explicitly stated in the report. One needs to subtract the number of nonfatal CHD from the number of ‘any MI’ to see that there were 11 fatal heart attacks in the treatment group, but only six in the control group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From my research, the reasons that fit my model include that it turns out statins are awful for your insulin sensitivity <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00125-015-3528-5.pdf">https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00125-015-3528-5.pdf</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Statin treatment increased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 46%, attributable to decreases in insulinsensitivity and insulin secretion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And furthmore (related to the widespread myopathy), statins might be a net-negative due to their other mechanisms that can exacerbate atherosclerosis <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25655639">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25655639</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[S]tatins may be causative in coronary artery calcification and can  function as mitochondrial toxins that impair muscle function in the  heart and blood vessels through the depletion of coenzyme Q10 and &#39;heme  A&#39;, and thereby ATP generation. Statins inhibit the synthesis of vitamin  K2, the cofactor for matrix Gla-protein activation, which in turn  protects arteries from calcification. Statins inhibit the biosynthesis  of selenium containing proteins, one of which is glutathione peroxidase  serving to suppress peroxidative stress. An impairment of selenoprotein  biosynthesis may be a factor in congestive heart failure, reminiscent of  the dilated cardiomyopathies seen with selenium deficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, if CHD were simple, it would have been solved already - it&#39;s certainly not from the lack of an army of much smarter and more dedicated people than us doing decades of research on the subject matter  so I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll come to an answer here, but I think this conversation is worth having specifically to point out that we won&#39;t get to the bottom of it, and that furthermore, there isn&#39;t necessarily an answer (certainly not one that has been effective at solving CHD). In that sense, I also think we&#39;re more in agreement than not - I&#39;m quite skeptical of any class of drugs being introduced that will &quot;cure&quot; heart disease, and your replies make me think we&#39;re on the same wavelength there. But just as we know that there are no drug treatments that cure MetS or T2DM but we do know of lifestyle/dietary modifications that (are clinically documented to) reverse MetS and T2DM, which also happens to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5928595/">improve almost all known CVD risk factors</a> as well. I&#39;d be very surprised if those result in worse hard endpoints, but I guess that&#39;s just something we&#39;ll need to be patient for in terms of acquiring the data and seeing the results.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Depends on the harmful substance. Whatever the method, we know they are bad for us and it&#39;s best to avoid them as much as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks for the great exchange! I do think we made quite clear where we both stand. Two things that I want to emphasize though </p>

<p>1) I make a distinction between what drives atherosclerosis (atherogenic lipoprotein seem heavily involved) vs what drives CHD incidences (lipids much less so - and this topic is even more complexe than atherogenesis). </p>

<p>2) I am not claiming that CHD is simple, and that there exist a simple solution. </p>

<p>I think my position is pretty reasonable. Given the high probability that LDL-p/c increase plaque burden, and given that I see no benefits for high LDL-c on any metrics, I choose to play it safe and make sure to keep my lipid within normal range. </p>

<p>If some people are fine with taking that bets that&#39;s on them, but as I said, with the current evidences that we have, this will never be recommended at a population level. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll see how it plays out as more evidence come forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yes, it was an interesting convo, although I feel like throwing something like &quot;no benefits for higher LDL-C on any metrics&quot; without any backing isn&#39;t a good way to get closure! I don&#39;t think it&#39;s settled, but there&#39;s plenty of evidence on either side (reverse causality and the relationship to people&#39;s &quot;default&quot; levels is the thing I think that&#39;s yet to be properly teased out as these are largely observational population studies, I&#39;ve excluded some of the most obvious versions of this like the Honolulu Heart Program results). From my POV, aiming for lower LDL-C is as much of a &quot;bet&quot; as the inverse (or rather, my take is maybe it doesn&#39;t much matter all that much or as posited by some of the research, the spontaneous change in cholesterol levels is what&#39;s important as a marker of health changes):</p>

<p>I did provide evidence for this throughout our exchange but they never were adress. </p>

<p>Observational studies are interesting but they have their limitation. Inverse causation and survivorship bias are strong possible confounder of those association. </p>

<p>Mandelian randomized controlled trial, which are stronger evidences, disagree with this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Results of the current study indicate that a genetic predisposition to high LDL-C levels contributes to mortality throughout life, including in the oldest old, and a beneficial LDL genetic risk profile is associated with familial longevity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So people with a genetic predisposition to low-cholesterol have lower mortality including in old age. </p>

<p>As I said, normal TC level in non-westernized, non-modern human is around 120mg/dl-150mg/dl. TC level around 200 mg/dl are pretty much unheard of, let alone level seen by some people on the ketogenic diet (300mg/dl+). </p>

<p>When you follow people early and long enough, low-cholesterol level throughout life is strongly associated with increase longevity (corroborating the mendelian studies)</p>

<p>Why do you feel that what happens in the elderly is relevant to the general population? I&#39;m in my early 30&#39;s. <del>I don&#39;t think I should start increasing my cholesterol by eating more animal product based on some observational studies in people over 65 years of age.</del> [Poor argument, clearly this is not what you were suggesting. Yet the only thing that can be suggested from your elderly study is that we maybe should not actively try to lower LDL-c cholesterol in old age. Yet my evidence suggest that there is no concern - actual benefits - with keeping cholesterol low (normal level, really) throughout life.]  </p>

<p>The MONDO study found that higher TGs is associated with lower all-cause death risk, <del>would it be sound to conclude that eating lots of processed carbs to increase your TGs is good?</del> [same - still, this shows that those association should be interpreted with caution - I don&#39;t think you would agree that we can conclude from this that high TGs is beneficial].  </p>

<p>I think those observation can be pretty much explain by confounding factors, and I see stronger evidence to the contrary, so, I stand by my word that there is not strong evidence of any benefits from having high LDL versus the much stronger evidence that it can increase plaque burden.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>As you rightly assume, I don’t think high TG is good and am a bit mystified by that result. As a matter of good practice I’ve of course collected lots of conflicting study results and often interesting patterns (or better understanding of mechanistics) result from unexpected findings (sometimes it’s just unreplicable, bad methodology, or just an outlier), but I think that including some of that in discussion is actually really worthwhile in this case as an illustration of why things aren’t that clear cut.</p>

<p>As for why I specifically think the elderly endpoints are useful it’s actually because they  <em>do</em> IMO look at the lifetime effect of cholesterol patterns (and specifically the relationship of ACM vs CHD) - many of the population studies track cholesterol on and ongoing basis, but some also simply based on early snapshots, which is fine since we’re simply testing for hypotheses - I think we’ll see some more interesting results as more people start mining larger data sets (like Feldman is doing with NHANES).</p>

<p>I think it’s also worth noting that LDL (and TG) are highly mobile - I’ve had 25%+ differences on testing done within a week (with equal fasting, relatively normalized diet). Those using Cardiocheks w/ more frequent testing report even bigger swings.</p>

<p>And since you’ve mentioned it, I think the question of what a “normal” level is, is worth pointing out - we largely don’t know what that is historically as LDL testing simply wasn’t available/done for most of the large population studies before we started modifying diets. I suppose that you could look at populations eating minimally processed foods with good metabolic health as a good proxy, but we also know there’s a large range for those eating traditional diets (Kitavans vs Tsimane vs Maasai etc). So we’re clear on the ranges, current treatment targets are for LDL &lt;100mg/dL and there’s a big push for &lt;70 now which seems quite low to me looking at the bend of the U-curve on ACM in the population studies I’ve seen.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>If you start following someone at 60 for 10-15 years, how do you know what his lifelong cholesterol pattern were? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a big push for &lt;70</p>

<p>Maybe because that&#39;s around the cutoff points where <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14623804">no plaque progression have been observed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16533939">actually regressed</a> </p>

<p>In my understanding, bomb calorimetry is the main way calorie information found on food packaging is determined. And my understanding is that the food product is burned in bomb calorimetry and the change in water temperature is measured.</p>

<p>I know enough chemistry and physics to think this is a somewhat reasonable yet deeply flawed process.</p>

<p>A particular flaw I haven&#39;t found any information on through cursory googling is the level of breakdown of the food in the bomb. To what extent are the bonds in the food broken? Are they burned until they simply won&#39;t anymore? </p>

<p>And in our bodies, to what extent would the same bonds be broken? In digestion it would appear (based on anecdotal evidence of corn pieces and green bits in stool) that the human body does not fully breakdown all of the produce products we consume. Does this mean we get more energy from highly processed foods that are easily broken down? Or that we absorb less than the number of calories listed on a packet of fresh veggies?</p>

<p>How is this accounted for in determining package info?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bomb calorimetry was the basis of the Atwater factor, to come up with the &quot;exact&quot; 4-4-9 calorie counts for carbs, proteins and fats.</p>

<p>You are correct these values take nothing physiological into account.  How big or small an impact physiology has on those approximations isn&#39;t clear but what is clear is that those values are only approximate.  They are not exact.</p>

<p>There&#39;s the thermic effect of food.  &quot;Most studies measure diet-induced thermogenesis as the increase in  energy expenditure above basal metabolic rate. Generally, the hierarchy  in macronutrient oxidation in the postprandial state is reflected  similarly in diet-induced thermogenesis, with the sequence alcohol,  protein, carbohydrate, and fat. A mixed diet consumed at energy balance  results in a diet induced energy expenditure of 5 to 15 % of daily  energy expenditure. Values are higher at a relatively high protein and  alcohol consumption and lower at a high fat consumption. Protein induced  thermogenesis has an important effect on satiety.&quot;  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC524030/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC524030/</a></p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is incorrect. Calorie information is determined by measuring the amount of fat, protein, carbohydrates, and fiber in foods. Bomb calorimetry hasn’t been used for a long long time.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks! This is exactly the sort of thing I was looking for. I&#39;ll definitely take a look at the paper linked and I&#39;ll probably find some more good stuff in their references.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Source? We know how much energy carbs, protein, and fats provide by the biochemical reactions they undergo and the ATP they yield.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Ok good to know. What methods are used to measure the content of the foods? I assume it is highly variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Calories have nothing whatsoever to do with ATP generation by macros, that&#39;s the point.  Yes there is energy stored in those chemical bonds and yes, our body uses a range of metabolic pathways -- some more efficient then others -- to extract that energy.   As I mentioned elsewhere, sometimes macros are simply excreted, no ATP gained there!</p>

<p>&quot;The system for determining the energy value of foods was founded &gt;100 y ago by Atwater et al (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396444/#bib1">1</a>)  at the USDA Agricultural Experiment Station in Storrs, CT. More than  100 y later, the Atwater general factors are still widely applied to  foods to estimate energy content. During this past century, there have  been few, if any, studies reporting on the energy value of a whole food  within a mixed diet that could confirm the accuracy of Atwater&#39;s  coefficients.&quot; </p>

<p>The only improvements made were regarding &quot;digestibility&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;In 1955 Merrill and Watt published a  report to update the energy content of macronutrients according to the  class of food in which they were found, and this report was further  updated in 1973 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396444/#bib2">2</a>).  Merrill and Watt took into consideration that compounds in a given  class of macronutrient can differ in heats of combustion and that  macronutrients as found in different foods can differ in digestibility.  They proposed a series of energy values for macronutrients as found in  different food sources, and these were termed the <em>Atwater specific factors</em>.  Their proposed coefficients of digestibility for protein ranged widely,  from 20% to 97%, and for carbohydrate from 32% to 98%. The proposed  heats of combustion for protein (minus 1.25 kcal lost as urea) ranged  from 3.75 to 4.55 kcal/g, and heats of combustion for carbohydrate  ranged from 2.45 to 4.20 kcal/g. In contrast, the ranges of estimated  values for coefficients of digestibility and heats of combustion for fat  were much narrower, at 90–95% and 9.3–9.5 kcal/g, respectively.  Moreover, the majority of foods were assigned a coefficient of fat  digestibility of 90% and a heat of fat combustion of 9.3 kcal/g, which  suggests that there is little variation in the energy available in a  gram of fat, regardless of food source. Nuts are among the many food  groups assigned a coefficient of fat digestibility of 90% and a heat of  fat combustion of 9.3 kcal/g based, in part, on the work of Jaffa (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396444/#bib3">3</a>).  However, much evidence has surfaced that suggests that the  digestibility of fat from whole nuts (and peanuts, which are actually  legumes) may be much lower than that for other food sources (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396444/#bib4">4</a>–<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396444/#bib6">6</a>).&quot;</p>

<div class="md"><p>Each is measured individually. Iirc nitrogen analysis for protein, nonpolar solvent extraction for fat, vacuum oven dehydration for water content, combustion for ash/mineral content and the remaining weight is carbs.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks for the correction. Seems like a good system but nuts certainly need their coefficient adjusted</p>

<p>If you focus only on calories in and calories out you will start lacking micronutrients, which will slowly increase your hunger and will require you more and more will power to continue until eventually you will crash and burn.</p>

<p>The processed food people gained weight and the unprocessed people lost weight.  This was a crossover study, so it really does seem to be the foodstuffs and not the macros exactly -- except of course for fiber. If you have 45% of your calories from carbohydrates that do not contain any real fiber, you&#39;ll get fatter.  If you have 45% (or more) of your calories from whole food carbohydrates with their natural fiber, you lose weight.</p>

<p>&quot;The menu was planned to restrict added sugar, while substituting other  carbohydates such as those in fruit, bagels, cereal, pasta, and bread so  that the percentage of calories consumed from carbohydrate was  consistent with their baseline diet, but total dietary sugar and  fructose were reduced to 10% and 4% of total calories, respectively.&quot;</p>

<p>Fructose is metabolized in the liver and stored easily as fat there, which causes a host of metabolic syndrome symptoms.</p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t eat much fruit in order to maintain ketosis, however, the fructose in fruit is never going to be an issue for people (well, watch out for dried fruit).  The study substituted FRUIT and yet dropped the amount of fructose in the diet.</p>

<p>The aim of this study was to assess the effect on 24-h energy balance of omitting compared with consuming breakfast prior to exercise.</p>

<p>Twelve healthy physically active young men (age 23 ± 3 y, body mass index 23.6 ± 2.0 kg/m2) completed 3 trials in a randomized order (separated by &gt;1 week): a breakfast of oats and milk (431 kcal; 65 g carbohydrate, 11 g fat, 19 g protein) followed by rest (BR); breakfast before exercise (BE; 60 min cycling at 50 % peak power output); and overnight fasting before exercise (FE). The 24-h energy intake was calculated based on the food consumed for breakfast, followed by an ad libitum lunch, snacks, and dinner. Indirect calorimetry with heart-rate accelerometry was used to measure substrate utilization and 24-h energy expenditure. A [6,6-2H2]glucose infusion was used to investigate tissue-specific carbohydrate utilization.</p>

<p>Results</p>

<p>The 24-h energy balance was −400 kcal (normalized 95% CI: −230, −571 kcal) for the FE trial; this was significantly lower than both the BR trial (492 kcal; normalized 95% CI: 332, 652 kcal) and the BE trial (7 kcal; normalized 95% CI: −153, 177 kcal; both P &lt; 0.01 compared with FE). Plasma glucose utilization in FE (mainly representing liver glucose utilization) was positively correlated with energy intake compensation at lunch (r = 0.62, P = 0.03), suggesting liver carbohydrate plays a role in postexercise energy-balance regulation.</p>

<p>Conclusions</p>

<p>Neither exercise energy expenditure nor restricted energy intake via breakfast omission were completely compensated for postexercise. In healthy men, pre-exercise breakfast omission creates a more negative daily energy balance and could therefore be a useful strategy to induce a short-term energy deficit.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Please correct me if I’m interpreting this wrong but the more negative energy is because they ate less correct? Or did they find increased energy expenditure or decreased absorption? Seems like we have a lot of studies now that show if you skip breakfast you don’t eat enough later in the day to make up for that, which could be useful for some.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>In the discussion, they say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In contrast, breakfast omission before exercise (FE) was partially compensated for at lunch, but not further compensated for later in the day </p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Here, we also demonstrate that pre-exercise breakfast omission is not fully compensated for via nonexercise physical activity energy expenditure when this is based on objective measures of physical activity in a free-living environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yes, when they omited breakfast before doing exercise they did not eat as much later in the day to compensate, and also their nonexercise energy expediture was not as low so it resulted in a bigger energy deficit over a 24h period.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>dummy here.  But I interpreted it the same way.  Seems like yes, skipping a meal means less calories.  But if calories are equated, wouldn&#39;t that mean the same results?  Or am I missing something.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yes, if calories were equated, that would be useless, but this study specifically looked at what happen in a free-living context, ie, what people tend to do spontaneously. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same reason why free-living study find that higher protein intake leads to more weight loss. They have a satiating effect so people tend to spontaneously eat less and hence lose more weight.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I did something similar on a n=1 scale logging food. If i skip breakfast, I am less hungry throughout all day.. Big breakfast gives me apetite for the evening. People who hate counting calories really benefit from skipping breakfast.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES</p>

<p>The aim of the study was to determine the value of a cluster of metabolic risk factors in predicting mortality after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).</p>

<p>BACKGROUND</p>

<p>The “deadly quartet” of metabolic risk factors (i.e., obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia) has been associated with coronary heart disease in healthy population studies. The expected influence of the cluster on survival in secondary prevention remains untested overall as well as by gender.</p>

<p>METHODS</p>

<p>Patients with lipid profiles undergoing primary isolated CABG (n = 6,428) between 1987 and 1992 were followed a median of eight years. Cox models were used to evaluate all-cause mortality. Metabolic risk factors were incorporated as the sum of deadly quartet risk factors present in each patient (0 to 4). The role of gender as it relates to survival and metabolic risk clusters was also examined.</p>

<p>RESULTS</p>

<p>The sum of deadly quartet risk factors showed a significant relationship to mortality as the hazard ratio increased from 1.64 (confidence interval [CI] = 1.34–2.01) for one risk factor to 3.95 (2.73–5.69) for four risk factors. Annualized mortality ranged from 1% per year in patients with no risk factors to 3.3% per year in patients with all four risk factors. Within gender, the hazard ratio associated with four risk factors was 2.58 for men and 13.39 for women. The expected clustering of risk factors was 8% compared to the observed clustering of 10% in men and 21% in women.</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS</p>

<p>This cohort showed risk factor clustering beyond that expected due to chance, particularly in women. Even after revascularization, survival is diminished for patients with members of a family of metabolic risk factors at the time of surgery.</p>

<p>The “deadly quartet” (obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia) was characterized by Kaplan (1) with inspiration from Reaven (2), who defined the metabolic syndrome. This grouping of known metabolic risk factors is highly associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) (3,4), and typically viewed as associated with insulin resistance (5). The increase in risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) as the number of risk factors progressively increases has been well documented (6). However, the demonstration of clustered risk in the primary prevention setting cannot necessarily be extrapolated to secondary prevention efforts. Although a recent analysis characterized risk clustering and 16-year outcomes in the follow-up of the healthy population of the Framingham cohort (7), both the degree of clustering and its impact on mortality have not been characterized in those with established coronary artery disease (3).</p>

<p>Separating the contributions of each of these factors to atherogenic risk has been complex. There is evidence that the members of the deadly quartet interact with one another as they relate to CHD (8–12), and even potentially represent a common metabolic abnormality (5). Defining the ultimate influence on mortality of some or all members of this metabolic quartet in patients with CHD could reshape current treatment strategies in secondary prevention (13–15). Such risk stratification could also be factored into decisions related to the benefits associated with surgical revascularization procedures (i.e., coronary artery bypass surgery). For example, the presence of diabetes, one member of the quartet, has already been reported to lead to greater mortality and event rates after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) (16–18).</p>

<p>We examined the post-CABG registry at the Cleveland Clinic to determine whether the deadly quartet resulted in increased mortality over the average eight years of follow-up. Further, we explored the role of gender in the susceptibility to these clustered risk factors.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Abstract— Isocaloric feeding of diets varying in lipid content to albino hairless mice has shown that their susceptibility to skin tumorigenesis induced by simulated solar UV light was not affected by the level of polyunsaturated fat, 5% or 20%. However a qualitative effect of dietary lipid was demonstrated. Mice fed 20% saturated fat were almost completely protected from UV tumorigenesis when compared with mice fed 20% polyunsaturated fat. Multiple latent tumours were detected in the saturated fat‐fed mice by subsequent dietary replenishment, suggesting that a requirement for dietary unsaturated fat exists for the promotion stage of UV‐induced skin carcinogenesis.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h2>&gt;Abstract</h2>

<h3>&gt;Background</h3>

<p>&gt;While several studies suggest beneficial effects of lower sodium on cardiovascular disease, the relationship with total mortality remains controversial. Some have reported a J-shaped curve, but this may be due to poor quality measurement of sodium or confounding bias.</p>

<h3>&gt;Objective</h3>

<p>&gt;To examine the relationship of well-characterized measures of sodium intake, estimated from urinary sodium excretion, with long-term mortality.</p>

<h3>&gt;Methods</h3>

<p>&gt;Two trials [Phase I (1987-90) over 18 month and Phase II (1990-5) over 36 months in the Trials of Hypertension Prevention] implemented sodium reduction interventions. Multiple 24-hour urines were collected from pre-hypertensive adults aged 30-54 during these trial periods. Post-trial deaths were ascertained over a median 24 years through December 31, 2013 using the National Death Index. The association of mortality with both the randomized intervention and average sodium intake was examined.</p>

<h3>&gt;Results</h3>

<p>&gt;Among 744 Phase I and 2382 Phase II participants randomized to sodium reduction or control, 251 deaths occurred, with a nonsignificant 15% lower risk in the active intervention (hazard ratio (HR)=0.85, 95% CI=0.66-1.09, p=0.19). Among 2,974 participants not assigned to an active sodium intervention, 272 deaths occurred. There was a direct linear association of average sodium intake with mortality, with HR=0.75, 0.95, 1.00 (reference), and 1.07 (p-trend = 0.30) for &lt;2300, 2300-&lt;3600, 3600-&lt;4800, and &gt;=4800 mg/24hr, respectively, with HR=1.12 per 1000 mg/24hr (95% CI = 1.00-1.26, p=0.05) and no evidence of a J-shape or nonlinear relation. The HR per unit increase in sodium/potassium ratio was 1.13 (95% CI = 1.01-1.27, p=0.04).</p>

<h3>&gt;Conclusions</h3>

<p>&gt;This study, with carefully characterized measures of sodium intake, found an increased risk at high sodium intake and a direct relation with total mortality even at the lowest levels of sodium intake. Overall, these results are consistent with a benefit of reduced sodium and sodium/potassium on total mortality over a period of over 20 years.</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>In discussing  sodium intake after reading [Urinary sodium excretion measures and health outcomes] <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30232-6/fulltext">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30232-6/fulltext</a> I made my opnion that one should salt food to taste for optimal health. A friend and physician disagreed with me citing the above linked article <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5098805/?fbclid=IwAR3Nn01iDCCpC_P9LVzsZkTilCeg1SIyjyEnw6-tHK7DW_9qhWhsU2XLzfA">Sodium Intake and All-Cause Mortality over 20 Years in the Trials of Hypertension Prevention</a> </p>

<p>I was quite confused by this article and the ultimate conclusions of the authors as the data did not (to me) support their position.   I&#39;m confused why the authors are reporting non-significant findings as if they were significant &quot;HR for mortality by randomized intervention group was 0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) =0.66-1.09, p=0.19).&quot; </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Am I simply missing something here?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Side question: How do people&#39;s blood pressure get so high in the first place? Is it total lack of potassium and chronic dehydration? I swear I eat 5+g of sodium a day, but my blood pressure is low. I exercise and get a decent amount of potassium from potatoes. I honestly feel like my blood pressure might even be too low at times.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m confused why the authors are reporting non-significant findings as if they were significant </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems to be the standard in nutrition science these days.  The difference was 8% vs 9%, not even worthy of a statistical hiccup.  The charts on the study are exactly the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>One explanation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Insulin can increase blood pressure via several mechanisms: increased renal sodium reabsorption, activation of the sympathetic nervous system, alteration of transmembrane ion transport, and hypertrophy of resistance vessels.&quot;

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yea it&#39;s the potassium.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Are you young? Age is a significant risk factor for blood pressure, just like for cholesterol. People can have the same exact diet and behavior over time and BP will go up.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Seems to be the standard in nutrition science these days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How many studies can you cite where they reported non significant findings as significant? Saying this is the standard is completely unfounded </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The difference was 8% vs 9%, not even worthy of a statistical hiccup. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not how statistics work, you can’t just call a certain % change a hiccup or assume it was noise </p>

<p>You constantly bash peer reviewed science but don’t seem to understand it . The logical fallacy of incredulity comes to mind</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Bingo. Aldosterone can&#39;t do its job without enough potassium</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>That makes sense. I can&#39;t see people getting more than 10-20% of the daily potassium requirements eating only processed foods.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Age is a significant risk factor for death. So yeah. Not only diet happens in 70 years of living.:)</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I call garbage what it is: garbage.</p>

<p>Look at these graphs: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5098805/figure/F1/?report=objectonly">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5098805/figure/F1/?report=objectonly</a></p>

<p>You seriously want to defend that 1 line is awesome and the other is horrible?  If these were stocks would one of them make you rich and the other tank your portfolio?</p>

<p>What makes this study garbage is the conclusions.  if they were honest and said &quot;we found nothing&quot; then the study would be fine.  instead they reported &quot;significant results&quot; that follow the conventional wisdom to make sure they can $ecure funding for their next garbage $tudy.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>But was there a change? The CI and Pvalue don&#39;t seem to indicate there was</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Exactly. It&#39;s the ratio that&#39;s important. This is why low salt diets show improvement because the ratio is closer to 1:1. But we need salt which is why low salt diets rarely cure the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You seriously want to defend that 1 line is awesome and the other is horrible?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends what you mean by defend? The authors don’t claim those results are significant and neither do I.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They didn’t find nothing. They found some non significant results and some statistically significant results. That’s what almost every study with multiple comparisons and analyses finds. I couldn’t care le$$ about your con$piratorial line of thinking, especially when you don’t appear to understand the statistics. Logical fallacy of incredulity keeps coming to mind.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m capable of reading the results, but that do not answer my question. 
My issue is that their statements don&#39;t jive with the stats.</p>

<p>This finding was statically significant </p>

<p>But after adjusting for other variables was no longer a statistically significant and was no longer a linear relationship. </p>

<p>So what gives?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Cholesterol Code is a pro-low carb blog written by an amateur researcher who generally advocates that low HDL and high triglycerides are the primary cause of CVD. Dr. Spencer Nadolsky is a former &quot;cholesterol denier&quot; who accepts the scientific consensus that LDL still matters. The blog&#39;s author wanted an outside perspective contrary to his claims to be presented on his blog in an effort to present &quot;the other side&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Early in residency training I reached out to experts like Dr. Dayspring and went to NLA meetings where they were all able to show me with much more convincing data that my LDL-hypothesis skepticism was uninformed.</p>

<p>He cites several scientific references, interviews, and articles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://peterattiamd.com/tomdayspring1/">Dr. Dayspring on Peter Attia’s podcast</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.118.009778">good quick recent review of the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29712560">Low carb diets can SOMETIMES increase LDL</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6173254/pdf/bmjsem-2018-000429.pdf">Dave Feldman of cholesterol code discusses the hyper-responders pdf warning</a></p>

<p><a href="https://cholesterolcode.com/lccholesterolchallenge-six-month-update/">Dave has posted a contest about finding a study that shows increased CVD risk when one has high HDL-C (above 50 mg/dL) , low triglycerides (below 100 mg/dL), and high LDL-C (above 130 mg/dL)</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034273">So far this contest question hasn’t been answered. We have many studies that adjust and use statistical analyses showing that LDL-C is an independent risk factor, but we don’t have a pooled cohort looking at his exact question. There are a few reasons for this as I will discuss. I thought I had found one in this recent paper that just came out from the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.022335">A recent prospective epidemiological study looked at the FH phenotype (LDL-C greater than 190 mg/dL) compared to non FH subjects and found a significant accelerated risk of atherosclerosis</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633353/">It’s not just unfair to make a direct comparison of FH to Hyper-responders for the reason of lifelong burden of LDL-C/P, but also because there may be other issues going on that increase atherosclerosis in these genetic situations. Those with FH may have changes in monocyte activity after retention of the LDL-particle within the artery</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>His hypothesis for low carb hyper responders:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>A decrease in LDL receptor activity and also increased lipoproteins from excess saturated fat and paucity of polyunsaturated fat.</li>
<li>A very low insulin state which would also decrease LDL receptor activity and potentially increase apoB formation.</li>
<li>A non oxidative pathway for ketones is cholesterol.</li>
<li>Ketogenic dieters have increased intakes of dietary cholesterol which does increase LDL cholesterol levels despite what some have said in the past.</li>
<li>Low soluble fiber intake may increase dietary and bile cholesterol absorption.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Continuing....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are multiple [mendelian randomization] studies showing that all genomic variation being equal, those SNPs that are associated with high LDL are very likely causally associated with CVD and longevity. Anyone who disputes these results doesn’t understand the gravity of this evidence.</p>

<p>So going back to the hyper-responder phenotype of elevated LDL particles. We have no reason based on genetic data that the increase in apoB/LDL particles is benign. We have only reason to believe it’s harmful.</p>

<p>Remember the studies done on LDL receptor genetic differences above? Well drugs that  increase LDL receptors have been shown to lower cardiovascular events. Take a look here (see graph).</p>

<p>The lower you bring your LDL particles via drugs that increase LDL receptor the lower your risk of vascular events.</p>

<p>I’m not advocating that everyone needs to take drugs. I am just answering the question at hand, which is do increased LDL particles increase risk of cardiovascular disease. Everything I have shown points to yes. Does this answer the question of whether increased LDL particles in the hyper-responder phenotype increase risk of cardiovascular disease? Not exactly, but it should give us some big clues.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Its not addressing the higher priority issue which is all cause mortality.</p>

<p>The question should be Why can ldl correlate with improved longevity despite  it also correlating with worse cardio outcomes?</p>

<p>Until they ask that question, we are all skirting around the real issues.</p>

<p>For example sydney diet heart study. <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e8707">https://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e8707</a></p>

<div class="md"><p>Having read the whole article, I first commend Dave Feldman for his commitment to open discussion and openness to listen to the “other” side. While he’s promoting his theory, he isn’t doing it in an echo chamber void of contrasting thought. Say what you will, but few in the nutrition/lipids universe seem willing to do so. </p>

<p>That said, Nadolsky lost credibility with me when he tried to equate Dave’s LDL “boat” correlation into LDL crashing into harbors and causing arterial intima damage. He leads into this by saying something to the effect that IF these harbors are damaged or rough, LDL particles will fix themselves there and with ApoB eventually cause atherosclerosis. This seems so wrong as he’s describing a damaged environment that LDL is attaching itself to but then claiming the LDL causes the damage. His own description seems to defeat his presentation of the prevailing (traditional) idea that LDL causes atherosclerosis. If the “harbor” is irregular or damaged in the first place, the root cause is not LDL, but inflammation due to any number of causes. </p>

<p>Further weakening his argument (which BTW, is not just his but all of traditional lipidology), he gives the latest approach that it’s not the LDL that’s the problem it’s the high LDL particle count. Errr, no it’s the high ApoB count. Or is it the high Remnant C count? This underscores the reality that the ball keeps moving with blame assignment moving every year. </p>

<p>I do appreciate and wish to correlate all the “Science” on this subject but based on all I’ve seen, I don’t trust the herd goals of those producing the “proof” of the LDL causation theory. I also understand all those who are on the fence and choose to mitigate their own particle constituents in what ever way they want to. After all depending on your age, high LDL is either good or bad, right? (LOFL!).</p>

<p>Personally, I applaud Dr. Nadolsky for following his mind and cooperatively contributing to the conversation. You don’t have to agree with him but you should understand his POV. As he (I think) admits, while his (pro low-carb) mind is made up, there is room for alternative thinking that we all wish to reconcile.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I tire of discussions where people measure their righteousness by the number of studies they can post to support their POV in a short time. If that’s what constitutes “science” to you then you excel at it. I do appreciate you’re diligence to get the last word and win at study-posting but your about as open to alternatives as Stalin was to democracy. My final LDL thought for you is if it’s such a dangerous molecule that lipidologists have deemed it necessary attempt to drive it completely out of existence, why did nature allow it to evolve in our bodies?</p>

<p>All cause mortality is important but it fails to capture quality of life and health span. We have gotten very good at keeping people alive after cardiac events like strokes and MIs but half of these patients gain a disability in the process (1)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Lifelong exposure to ldl cholesterol is what causes atherosclerosis. A single measurement is just a snapshot of a fluctuating number. High lifelong LDL exposure does not correlate with improved longevity, low lifelong exposure is causally related to increased longevity and health outcomes. One reason why LDL is lower in people with chronic diseases is disease lowers cholesterol levels (reverse causality). Nobody is skirting around this, it’s well known you just haven’t been paying attention to the literature (2)</p>

<p>The Sydney diet heart study is not a reliable piece of evidence </p>

<p>“The Sydney Heart Study35 was unique among the diet trials on CVD because a margarine high in trans unsaturated fat was a major component of the diet for participants assigned to the high polyunsaturated diet. When this trial was conducted, there was little recognition of the harms of trans unsaturated fat in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, so the researchers inadvertently tested substitution of saturated with an even more atherogenic trans fat. As predicted from current knowledge about trans unsaturated fat, CVD events were higher in the experimental group. If anything, this trial confirmed the results of observational studies that also report higher CVD risk from results from regression models in which trans unsaturated fat replaced saturated fat.41,42”</p>

<p>nor is the Minnesota coronary survey which is a nothing study lipid deniers like to cite </p>

<p>“The Minnesota Coronary Survey34 compared high polyunsaturated with high saturated fat diets in patients hospitalized for mental illness. The participants were given the assigned diets only when they were patients in the hospital. Because hospitalization for mental illness became less common and less prolonged after the study started, as a national trend, the patients received the assigned diets intermittently, contrary to the intent of the researchers, and for a much shorter time than planned. The researchers originally enrolled 9570 participants in the trial and intended to study them for at least 3.6 years to be able to adequately test the effect of the diets. However, the trend toward outpatient treatment of mental illness resulted in ≈75% of the participants being discharged from inpatient care during the first year of the study. Only about half the remaining patients stayed in the study for at least 3 years. The average duration was only 384 days. The incidence of CHD events was similar in the 2 groups, 25.7 and 27.2 per 1000 person-years in the control and polyunsaturated fat groups, respectively. A recent reanalysis of this trial restricted to the participants who remained in the trial for at least 1 year also found no significant differences in CHD events or CHD deaths.39 We excluded this trial from the core group because of the short duration, large percentage of withdrawals from the study, and intermittent treatment, which is not relevant to clinical practice. Another concern is the use of lightly hydrogenated corn oil margarine in the polyunsaturated fat diet. This type of margarine contains trans linoleic acid, the type of trans fatty acid most strongly associated with CHD.40” (3)</p>

<p>Dyslipidemia is one of the many causes of endothelial dysfunction. Other causes include inflammation, aging, smoking, etc.</p>

<p><em>Dyslipidemia and endothelium-dependent relaxation in internal mammary arteries used for coronary bypass surgery</em></p>

<p>“A 1 mmol increase of total cholesterol was associated with a 11.2% decrease of endothelium-dependent relaxation (P=0.006). When total cholesterol was omitted from the model, LDL-cholesterol became the best predictor of endothelium-dependent relaxation (regression coefficient 10.3%/mmol; P=0.02). No other variable was significantly associated with endothelium-dependent relaxation, and none of the preoperative variables was associated with endothelium-independent relaxation, expressed as the response to sodium nitrite (10 mM). Conclusion: Our study showed that endothelium-dependent relaxation in apparently non-diseased internal mammary arteries used for coronary bypass surgery was independently related to preoperative (LDL)-cholesterol levels.”

</div>
<div class="md"><p>One core tenet of this sub is to use scientific evidence when discussing a subject. I don&#39;t think people are trying to measure their rightneousness by doing so. If there are multiple studies supporting one&#39;s point, what&#39;s wrong with posting many of them? </p>

<p>This might not be a philosophy you agree with and as such, maybe this sub might not be a good fit for you? </p>

<p>We have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bqi550/posting_guidelines/?st=jwlzjska&amp;sh=1618dfe5">Posting Guidelines</a>. Please make sure to read them and if you choose to engage on this sub, expect that people will use evidence - maybe many - while discussing things with you, and keep in mind that they will also expect you to provide evidence when making a claim and explaining why you disagree with their evidences by using counter-evidence or explaining the limitation of the evidence they used. </p>

<p>Again, nothing wrong with disagreeing with the idea of using studies when making a point, but if you choose to hang around (which I hope you will since I think we have a very pasionnate and respectful community!) just beware that this is expected.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well the 8lives dude has been claiming and proving LDL being causal for years now. And actually the majority of the science is still on his side, since the majority of science is done with interest to promote statins. For the time, we cant really deny LDL plays a role. Looking at the evidence it does, but causality was claimed only with the help of mendelian randomization, which is such a complex approach, that the results can be easily skewed by something that we don&#39;t know yet about certain genotypes. The lipid system seems too complex to be dependant on a single variable. Also CVD is still increasing as a whole, while we have all the LDL focused treatment. That&#39;s why I am sceptical that LDL is a causal factor, there is also not a single study which found that other markers were more significant than LDL alone for CVD risk. </p>

<p>The likelihood that all the genes related to LDL-c have the same or different confounder that all also affect CHD risk is extremely slim. This is one of the strength of mendelian studies. They are not your typical observational studies and it takes much more than a possible unknown confounder to explain them away, and they strongly support a causal role for LDL-c in atherosclerosis.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Since we know that heart disease is a multifactorial disease stating LDL is causal prompts an issue: how causal? And can it be causal in some contexts and irrelevant in others? Cause it seems so, because Dave Feldman is still waiting for his study, where high hdl, low tg, high ldl people would have statistically higher risk for CVD. If LDL would be the sole factor, then it would be fine. There are tens of factors, in a lot of studies LDL alone has lesser importance than other dynamic factors like tg/hdl ratio, LDL/HDL ratio and so on. While LDL is needed to have atherosclerosis, because thats how the system works, can we really say that LDL is the cause of it? can be that malfunction of the lipid system as a whole uses LDL to cause CVD. On paper LDL is still the hand doing the crime, but it doesnt really have a motive, it was told to do it. Thats the beef about it. LDL looks like hivemind citizens: they can be told to do one or another, but a higher mind is probably behind. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>risk is extremely slim</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet there still is a chance that we dont know something major regarding lipids and the genes involved. And we are curing the symptoms instead of the real cause. Yes, simptoms also kill, but treating symptoms doesnt help to heal.</p>

<p>In overall my response is more rhetorical questioning than really claiming something. It just feels that fat avoidance didnt really help us getting healthier as a whole. And it seems a lot of LDL treating lifestyle interventions have other major health risks, which usually are hardly worth it.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that nobody is seriously arguing that LDL-c is the sole, only risk factor for CHD. That&#39;s a strawman. It just so happen to be a pretty important one for the disease to progress. High trig are also bad. High blood sugar is also bad. Infection can play a role. Iron overload can play a role. Stress does too. Smoking is another one. </p>

<p>The evidence for high LDL not being a problem as long as you don&#39;t have inflammation and/or good metabolic health (low trig/high HDL-c) are pretty much non-existant a this moment. It&#39;s interesting, but speculative. </p>

<p>This is contextual. Lowering LDL-c when you hit your 50&#39;s and the damage is already done? Not likely to make a huge difference. Keeping your LDL-c low your whole life? Likely to make a huge difference.</p>

But base on what we know, would it be even better if you improved everything, including LDL? I&#39;d say the odd favor a yes, but again, nobody can actually say for sure.  </p>

<p>What I don&#39;t agree with is people trying to discredit the lipid hypothesis as if LDL-c had no role whatsoever to play in the disease and that tell people who experience elevated LDL-c on a ketogenic diet to not care about it cause it does not matter. Some people even go as far as saying that high LDL-c is healthy because of some observational studies with very questionnable causality that found increase in some diseases (cancer, depression, suicide) or mortality in old age (the very same people who usually discredit observational studies as junk science), while downplaying drug trials, prospective cohort studies, mendelian studies, animal studies, mechanistical studies who all consistenly show that LDL-c matter. </p>

<div class="md"><p>Have there been any successful interventions where lowering remnant cholesterol reversed atherosclerosis? How do you only lower remnant cholesterol? Since all cholesterols are atherogenic why not lower them all?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Because you post here often with an almost singular focus on LDL as the cause of atherosclerosis, and a disregard for other variables.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think many argue LDL or other lipoproteins are unimportant, but they don&#39;t fully seem to acount for CVD risk. </p>

<p>Athrogenic activity of LDL seems to rely on oxidative status, and possibly heparan sulfate levels. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24333941/">Potential roles of vessel wall heparan sulfate proteoglycans in atherosclerosis.</a></p>

<p>HDL seems to be Athrogenic only under certain conditions, and anto-athrogenic under others. So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to cast all lipoproteins as Athrogenic. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/21304474">HDL and cardiovascular disease: atherogenic and atheroprotective mechanisms.</a>/</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if there have been any interventional trials successful or not on remanat cholesterol. 
The lack of successful statin clinical trials following rule changes requiring pre-registration likely points to at least some level of publication bias in the lipid hypothesis and casts doubt on statins effectiveness. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regrettably, some clinical trials prior to 2004
have been tainted by scandals that led to new clinical trial
regulations intended to safeguard patients and lend credibil-
ity to subsequent trials.3,4 The table summarizes 29 major
RCTs of cholesterol reduction reported after the publication
of these regulations (Table). Notably, only 2 of these 29
studies reported a mortality benefit, while nearly two-thirds
reported no cardiovascular benefit at all. These unfavorable
outcomes and inconsistent results suggest that the lipid
hypothesis has failed the test of time.</p>

<div class="md"><p>While I&#39;m not saying this invalides the conclusions, I think this study had a potentially large analytical flaw in that they used BMI instead of body fat percentage.  Normally the &#39;BMI sucks&#39; argument doesn&#39;t have very strong validity but I think in this specific case it might be a cogent argument.  Army personnel are much more likely to have above-average muscle mass compared to the (largely sedentary) civilian population and increased muscle mass will inflate the overall BMI averages more in the Army sample than the civilian sample.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Anyone know what the dietary differences are between US army personnel and civilians? I would imagine the SAD is as bad as it gets (maybe after the new Indian diet).</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I have asked this before, but does anyone else think that stress (more than diet) could be the key factor determining cardiovascular health? After all, being in the army is not exactly a delightful experience.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not aware of single study that controlled for distress (as opposed to eustress).</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point. Even passing basic training and physical training would stimulate more muscle growth than the average sedentary person has.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yup, people complain constantly about military BMI measures for that exact reason. I mean, many of the men and women in the military are overweight, but the muscle bound guys/gals are above average built, and a couple of times a year they have to jump through bureaucratic hoops to prove they are not in fact overweight.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Oh for craps sake, how big a difference could it be? A pound or maybe two?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Could be many things, but military members (Marine Corps, here) eat a lot of fast food. It&#39;s an unwritten rule to avoid the chow hall as much as possible, and with a dozen fast food places on each base, and kids having disposable income for the first time, guess where everyone eats. The chow hall isn&#39;t much healthier though. It&#39;s all canned food, fried food and low quality meats, and buffet style serving of sugary drinks, dessert bars, baked potato bars with fake cheese and bacon, and so on.</p>

<p>Also, everyone is young. Most of the men and women are coming from 18 years of eating what their parents put in front of them, and then suddenly they get to make their own dietary choices. Some of us have never seen so much food before!</p>

<p>On top of that there&#39;s heavy tobacco use, heavy drinking, punishing exercise, and weeks eating MREs which are basically dog food for humans.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Sleep deprivation is also common in the military and that is <a href="https://peterattiamd.com/matthewwalker1/">terrible for all kinds of health factors</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Wow, I had a totally different view of what armed forces ate. You would think that a greater effort to remove junk food would be made.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What&#39;s crazy about the whole situation is the military is the one sector in life where authorities have 100% control over everything. If commanders didn&#39;t want personnel eating junk food, or smoking, or even drinking, they could make that happen and there&#39;s nothing anyone can say or do about it. Yet the commanders don&#39;t. I don&#39;t know why. Troop morale? Kickbacks from the fast food industry? Could be any number of things.</p>

<p>Either way, the military has an obesity problem on its hands. I was chubby in The Marine Corps. Always bumping up against the upper limits of regulations. (I&#39;m in better shape now than I was then.) I remember at one morning formation, looking around and being surprised at the high number of &quot;beer bellies&quot; I saw.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The military is actually one of the things that Nina Teicholz used as an example of why our dietary guidelines suck.  She was talking about how the military uses the dietary guidelines in deciding what they eat and yet there is an obesity problem there.  I&#39;ve been upset at our guidelines for awhile, but their effect on the military is something I hadn&#39;t considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The number who actually adhere to the dietary guidelines, in service or not, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p1116-fruit-vegetable-consumption.html">is small</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I could get behind her message if not for the fast food. One time I was standing in line at the chow hall and one of the exasperated cooks yelled at everyone, &quot;Yo! It&#39;s the 15th. We just got paid. What are you doing here?!&quot; Because really, everyone avoids eating the government food when they can. Even the cooks don&#39;t want you to be there.</p>

<p>The military might be proof that no one is following the guidelines.</p>

<p>Some of my friends in the service were in amazing shape, and I sat with them to eat from time to time. What they had on their plate was very different from mine. Rice, veggies, lean meat, lots of fruit, no fried stuff, no desserts. Probably not too far off from official guidelines. The &quot;classic&quot; idea of a healthy diet.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s really interesting.  The funny thing is, the podcast I mentioned is more focused on low-carb/keto eating, so they likely wouldn&#39;t agree with what your in-shape friends were eating.  To me though, the thing that sticks out is their diet is at least avoiding ultra-processed, veg oils, refined carbs/grains, and low sugar so in that aspect I think most people should be able to agree it&#39;s much better than most things out there.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Oh sure, they also skipped the sandwiches and subs and other foods which are just stomach filling carbs without much nutrition.</p>

<p>On a related note, these days, when I have dinner with my obese friend at his house, when the food hits the table out comes the bbq sauce, ranch, mayo, horseradish sauce, etc. A whole bunch of extra processed crap full of sugar and veg oils that ruins what might have otherwise been a healthy meal.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Conceptually makes sense... the brain will still function with ketone bodies supplying energy instead of glucose; however, the tumor should stop growing considering ketogenic diet will inhibit anabolic pathways. </p>

<p>Not exactly a cure, but an avenue worth more research-- especially interesting in combination with drug trials.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>: Prognosis for patients with high-grade brain tumor is poor and survival did neither substantially change with advances in chemotherapy, radiotherapy and molecular profiling. Ketogenic diets have been suggested as a promising alternative therapy. However, group studies in cancer patients with the classical ketogenic diet so far provided little or no evidence that the classical ketogenic diet is indeed beneficial in terms of prolonging survival.  </p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>: Here we present three cases: one patient with grade 3 brain tumor, (pat #1: anaplastic oligodendroglioma) and two patients with grade 4 brain tumor (pat #2: recurrent glioblastoma; pat #3: new-onset glioblastoma). The three patients were started on the strickest form of the paleolithic ketogenic diet (PKD): the full meat-fat diet. At the time of diet onset all three patients refused chemotherapy and radiotherapy and did neither use any dietary supplements nor standard medications. They all strictly adhered to the diet and were in constant ketosis. Pat #1, who was overweight at diet onset, lost 25 kg on the diet during the first nine months of the diet. During this time tumor size was relatively stable. Later on tumor size gradually increased which was preceded by a gradual increase in food intake without affecting ketosis. Along with this inflammatory parameters increased as well. The patient was advised to decrease food intake and subsequently inflammatory parameters decreased again. In pat #2, in addition to recurrent glioblastoma, past history also included bladder cancer. Despite surgery and radiochemotherapy his brain tumor recurred. Upon recurrence, the patient stopped radiochemotherapy and started the PKD as a stand-alone therapy. Currently, the patient is on the diet for 14 months and is progression-free. Pat #3 had a stable tumor size for the first two months of the diet when he used the diet as a stand-alone therapy. Then, despite being progression-free and having no sympoms at all, the patient decided to have radiotherapy. Although we advised against, he also started taking multiple supplements and began hyperbaric oxigen therapy. From this time on his disease progressed and the patient died at 11 months. Conclusions: The two patients using the PKD as a stand-alone therapy are still alive at 25 and 14 months while the third patient after starting additional therapies experienced progression and died.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well.. it is for sure irresponsible to state that additional therapies accelarated the death of the 3rd patient. All cancers are different, parallel diseases are different, state of overall health of the patient  is different. There are too many variables to conclude anything like this from a case study. 
I am really pro keto, I have been using it for quite a while. I am also thrilled about the potential, but to this day, keto is not approved as a stand alone therapy and its very risk to apply it single handedly. 3 case studies are not science. We should be cautious about this kind of information. Use keto as an adjunct, but also trust the traditional medicine, cause cancer is no joke.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Not sure what they&#39;re concluding here. The conclusion reads more like an observation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conclusions: The two patients using the PKD as a stand-alone therapy are still alive at 25 and 14 months while the third patient after starting additional therapies experienced progression and died.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is the implied conclusion that the diet is saving these two patients, while the third patient died because they started additional therapies in addition to being on the diet? Seems like a <em>huge</em> reach.</p>

<p>It also mentions they advised against additional therapies for one of the patients. This sounds incredibly irresponsible. Lifestyle interventions for cancer should be used in addition to proven cancer treatment. Why would they advise a cancer patient to avoid something like radiotherapy in place of an experimental diet?</p>

<p>Also note that the three authors have stake in <a href="https://www.paleomedicina.com/en">paleomedicina</a>. All factors considered, these three cases don&#39;t seem to show much and to me feel like a marketing attempt for their business masked as &quot;science.&quot; Come on. We&#39;re barely scratching the surface with ketogenic/low-carb diets, and now they&#39;re suggesting their &quot;paleo keto diet&quot;? I guess it makes sense from a business perspective.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Well.. it is for sure irresponsible to state that additional therapies accelarated the death of the 3rd patient.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They did not. Here&#39;s the actual conclusion from the PDF</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUSIONS: The two patients (pat#1 and pat#2) that have been using the PKD as a stand-alone therapy are still alive at 25 and 14 months after diet onset. Pat#2, who had the worst initial outlook (recurrent glioblastoma and a past history of bladder cancer), but well-controlled the amount of food, is progression-free and symptom-free for 14 months. Pat#3 was also progression-free and symptom-free so far the diet was used as a stand-alone therapy. <strong>After receiving radiotherapy, steroid and other ”alternative” treatments his condition progressed</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a case study of three patients. How else would you have them phrase the fact that the third person&#39;s condition progressed <em>after</em> receiving these treatments (they never implied causality; and they used the word &quot;associated&quot; elsewhere)? Would you like them to suppress this fact, and not report it at all?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p><a href="https://peterattiamd.com/tomseyfried/">https://peterattiamd.com/tomseyfried/</a></p>

<p>From above podcast. If i remember correctly standard treatment for some brain tumors don&#39;t actually improve survival time... And for said brain tumors basically everyone dies in pretty quick time yet we currently have a few people who have managed their brain tumor with strict ketogenic diet who have survived for many more years than what is typical. in the abscence of ketogenic diet this doesnt happen....</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I mean they are charging the standard doctor consultation fees. Would you ignore your doctor&#39;s advice because he is charging you fees based on a business perspective?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>After receiving radiotherapy, steroid and other ”alternative” treatments his condition progressed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This line states that the disease progressed when the patient received additional treatment than KD alone. So how would you describe, what they have said here?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Gotcha. I&#39;m aware keto diets have shown some promise for certain kinds of cancers. My criticism isn&#39;t about that, but more about the impression I got from this paper.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Seems like they&#39;re pushing a brand. It certainly doesn&#39;t feel like your average physicians website. Couple that with their &quot;implied conclusion&quot; that the &quot;paleo&quot; KD works while a classic KD doesn&#39;t. It doesn&#39;t strike me as completely genuine, but that&#39;s just my opinion.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p><em>After receiving radiotherapy, steroid and other ”alternative” treatments his condition progressed</em>  </p>

<p>This line states that the disease progressed when the patient received additional treatment than KD alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct. They reported what they observed. My question to you is: why is this irresponsible of them to report? Had they suggested that this was the <em>cause</em> I&#39;d see your point.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>She is promoting Paleolithic Ketogenic diet because it works for her patients. Would you like her to stop doing that and inhibit herself from publishing her results to the scientific community? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s more context into her work <a href="https://youtu.be/nDPM8o9jcFA">https://youtu.be/nDPM8o9jcFA</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>An average person can for sure imply causation on such a finding. That the person got sicker because of the additional treatment. We dont really know the context, why this person tried alternative treatments, perhaps his situation was quite different? Thats why I dont like the conclusions.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I would&#39;ve liked them to conclude with something more genuine, like &quot;These case studies show promise for PKD but it&#39;s premature to make any conclusions and more research is needed.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m also sure she&#39;s dealt with that worsened on the PKD. Does she publish these as well or does she simply batch publish positive case studies?</p>

<p>The fact that they simply re-stated the results as the conclusion seems misleading, and doesn&#39;t strike me an honest oversight. Specially after considering the background of all involved. I&#39;ve no issues with her publishing anything or helping anyone. It&#39;s the delivery that has me wondering.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Homogenization is an interesting topic in nutrition. From what I&#39;ve gathered, it&#39;s not uncommon for people to fail to satisfy all their optimal nutritional health needs, and that a good means to attempt to satisfy their nutritional needs is to consume a diet diverse in foods.</p>

<p>It also seems that food groups such as meat and eggs provide quite a differing quantity of nutritional benefits, compared to what can be found in other food groups.</p>

<p>If these things are true, then can one reason, ethical considerations aside, that the best thing a vegan could do for their nutritional health, would be to consume something like an egg, or meat?</p>

<p>If this is to be true, then what might the benefits a vegan find, if they were to consume some sort of animal product on a monthly basis?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gathered that, sea meats tend to be healthier for us than land meats, mostly because the fatty oils in seafood tends to benefit us more so than fatty land oils (which includes things like vegetable oil). Some vegans don&#39;t appear to have a moral objection to consuming oysters, so to these vegans, might it be wise for them to consume oysters, to get the health benefits of eating meat from a sea creature?</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>If you are vegan, you can get the benefits of dietary diversity by eating a diversity of plant foods. Don’t exclude any of the plant based food groups (grains, nuts) unnecessarily. Don’t eat a lot of nutrient-poor refined foods that make it more difficult to get necessary nutrients from your daily intake. Yes, certain animal products can be a sort of “insurance” against deficiencies because we are animals and our cells require the same molecules as other animals’ cells. Oysters contain a lot of zinc and vitamin B12, which is a good contribution to a healthy diet, but a wise vegan can get similar benefits from incorporating pumpkin seeds and hemp seeds plus a B12 supplement. </p>

<p>The “best thing a vegan could do for their nutritional health” is keep an eye on their nutrient intake and become educated about what plant foods are good contributors of certain nutrients, or supplementing where that is a more realistic option. No animal products necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It depends on the individual diet. If the diet has a high omega 6 to 3 ratio it would be probably healthy to include EPA and DHA in the diet, for example fish or oysters (or algae oil which is fine as well, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17713804">study</a>). If the diets lacks iron than red meat could be used to treat this iron deficiency (similar effects can IMO be achived by increasing iron intake from plant sources).</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I have no reason to believe that a well-planned vegan diet gets healthier if you add animal products.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Why would ethical considerations be aside? Isn&#39;t ethics the core of veganism?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I see your line of thinking. Adding an egg here and there sounds like a good insurance policy against getting dangerously on certain nutrients that aren&#39;t found in high quantities in plants. However the amount of animal product you would need to actually make a difference in your levels of those nutrients is probably about the same as when you start seeing those negative health benefits appear. I like the idea of consuming things like clams and oysters though. Especially since they are among the lowest in Mercury.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>&gt;I&#39;ve gathered that, sea meats tend to be healthier for us than land meats</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Um, no, I don&#39;t think that has been shown to be true.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks mate. Do you know how would one go about creating a well-planned vegan diet, that has enough variation that homogenization doesn&#39;t end up causing it to be ineffective with time?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Because I wish to talk about nutrition and not ethics.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Its due to omega 3 and 6 balancing.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Try to avoid getting a lot of calories from highly processed foods, especially foods high in calories without many nutrients like oil, sugar refined flour...</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Check out the &quot;daily dozen&quot; app if you check all the boxes in the app you are pretty safe from nutrient deficiencies. A diet high in legumes, green leafy, vegetables and high in omega 3 is the way to go IMO and encouraged by the app aswell.  </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Supplements: </p>

<p>-Take your B12 (non-negotiable)</p>

<p>- depending on where you live and how much sun you get Vitamin D should be supplemented durin winter</p>

<p>-DHA (Micro algae oil): The science is unclear on that one Imo. If you have a low omega 6 to 3 ratio you may convert enough ALA omega 3 to EPA and DHA (EPA is not that much of a problem), but if you want to enjoy your high omega 6 (peanuts, cashews, almonds, sunflowerseeds ...) foods without having to worry and just play it safe, I would recommend taking it.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>If you start to get into routine (most people do) and you know what your typical day of eating looks like put it in cronometer and check if you get everything you need.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>These recommendations are pretty conservative. There are a lot of vegans who dont pay this much attention to their diet and are fine, but I think it is your health on the line so better be safe than sorry.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Then you mean plant-based, there’s nothing healthy about avoiding leather or fur, which is also veganism.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Also the fact that when eating fish people tend to eat more of the body, sometimes even the bones. Whereas land meat it&#39;s almost always merely the muscle. There are all kinds of healthy nutrients in the ligaments, cartilage, bones, and other such things, which is usually ignored in land meat.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Take your B12 (non-negotiable)</p>

<p>You can get this from fortified foods like nutritional yeast or soy milk as well</p>

<p>Edit: From a quick google search I couldn’t really find much,</p>

<div class="md"><p>Those theories died over a decade ago, when antioxidant trials in humans and animals lead to worse outcomes.</p>

<p>This is may be the most cited paper (353 times) on antioxidants in the past 5 years. When I first read it, it summed up my conclusions when I attempted to answer questions like yours for myself.</p>

<p>Forman et al, 2014. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3852196/">How do nutritional antioxidants really work: nucleophilic tone and para-hormesis versus free radical scavenging in vivo</a>. <em>Free Radical Biology and Medicine</em>, <em>66</em>, pp.24-35.</p>

<p>Some simple truths:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some inflammatory cascades cause uncontrolled damage from reactive oxygen species. Things that may seem unrelated, like ischemia-reperfusion injury after heart attacks/strokes, have endogenous inflammatory ROS generation as their effective mechanism.</li>
<li>normally, ROS are vital to cell signalling</li>
<li><strong>exo</strong>genous antioxidants can interfere with cell signalling</li>
<li>organisms have dealt with reactive oxygen species for over two billion years, and have finely regulated <strong>endo</strong>genous antioxidant responses</li>
<li>exogenous antioxidants also have prooxidant activity, from either redox cycling or catalytic activity. When bodybuilders OD on green tea extract, their livers die because EGCG at high doses is a redox cycler, depleting endogenous antioxidants like reduced glutathione</li>
<li>exogenous anti/pro-oxidants appear to have benefit through inducing regulated endogenous antioxidant response.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to delve, I have some assemblages on <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-2XWDkPfB2Oc050cVJWeVF5cHc">antioxidants</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-2XWDkPfB2OcWFTMndaLUVsR0E">oxidative stress</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-2XWDkPfB2OMzd2dXhBNkpRa2c">Nrf2 hormesis</a>, though it seems I haven&#39;t scoured the literature for a few years.</p>

- Biochemistry of oxidative stress
- Physiology
- Oxidative dna damage
- Oxygen toxicity
- Oxidants and antioxidants
- Free radicals scavengers
- Vitamins role

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Abstract
CHC22 clathrin plays a key role in intracellular membrane traffic of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 in humans. We performed population genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the CHC22-encoding CLTCL1 gene, revealing independent gene loss in at least two vertebrate lineages, after arising from gene duplication. All vertebrates retained the paralogous CLTC gene encoding CHC17 clathrin, which mediates endocytosis. For vertebrates retaining CLTCL1, strong evidence for purifying selection supports CHC22 functionality. All human populations maintained two high frequency CLTCL1 allelic variants, encoding either methionine or valine at position 1316. Functional studies indicated that CHC22-V1316, which is more frequent in farming populations than in hunter-gatherers, has different cellular dynamics than M1316-CHC22 and is less effective at controlling GLUT4 membrane traffic, altering its insulin-regulated response. These analyses suggest that ancestral human dietary change influenced selection of allotypes that affect CHC22’s role in metabolism and have potential to differentially influence the human insulin response.</p>

<p>&quot;... a dietary metabolite linked to red meat called trimethylamine N-oxide, or TMAO. Three recent meta-analyses confirmed that high blood levels of TMAO are associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. One of the studies, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association in 2017, found a more than 60% heightened risk of both major adverse cardiovascular events and death from all causes in people with elevated TMAO. Other research has associated higher TMAO levels with heart failure and chronic kidney disease.&quot;</p>

<p>This recent study using mandelian randomization found reverse causality with CVD/diabetes resulting in an increase of TMAO levels, not the other way around. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract
We examined the causal direction between gut microbiota-dependent metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) or its predecessors and cardiometabolic diseases such as risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We used genetic variants as instruments to test the causal associations. Genetically predicted higher TMAO and carnitine were not associated with higher odds of T2DM, AF, CAD, MI, stroke, and CKD after Bonferroni correction (P≤0.0005). However, we observed that genetically increased choline showed a suggestive association with higher risk of T2DM (odds ratio: 1.84, 95% confidence interval: 1.00 to 3.42 per 10 units, P=0.05). In contrast, genetically predicted higher betaine (0.68, 0.48 to 0.95 per 10 units, P=0.023) was suggestively associated with a lower risk of T2DM. We observed a suggestive association of genetically increased choline with a lower level of body fat % (beta: -0.28, SE: 0.11, P=0.013), but a higher level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (0.10±0.05, P=0.034). We further found that T2DM (beta: 0.130, SE: 0. 0.036, P&lt;0.0001) and CKD (0.483±0.168, P=0.004) were causally associated with higher TMAO levels. Our MR findings support that T2DM and kidney disease increase TMAO levels and observational evidence for cardiovascular diseases may be due to confounding or reverse causality.</p>

<p>My personal belief is the red meat/mortality connection is the byproduct of the healthy user bias. I&#39;ll be interested if the reverse causality of TMAO and CVD/diabetes is confirmed through replication of this study, or other supporting data, and what other alternatives will be presented to explain the red meat connection.</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>I never bought the TMAO/CVD story, as fish consumers would be exposed to orders of magnitude more TMA than red meat consumers via carnitine. It seems likely to me that high TMAO status is a coincident marker of diets (and resultant microbiome composition) that are harmful by other mechanisms.</p>

<p>The apparent choline / betaine causal associations with T2DM is supported by past observational metabolomics. Beets and spinach over eggs.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Most fish have very little TMAO. It’s only deep sea fish that have it in any significant amounts. </p>

<p>The TMA content of all fish is not significant.</p>

<p>Still I haven&#39;t understood what is currently considered the most effective anti-cancer diet for preventing cancer. In principle keto diets starve cancers due to lack of glucose but still I have read about studies finding more cancer in keto subjects maybe because of too much meat. Also vegetarian diets have seemingly lower cancer rates.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Can you please share the studies regarding more cancers in keto subjects?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think the best diet for avoiding cancer is one that avoids hyperinsulinemia; the diet to achieve that may differ from person to person. I also think that a diet that promotes autophagy is likely a good idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Add in a regular strength training regiment to this lifestyle and one is good to go.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Though if an x-ray or CT-scan is indicated by your physician, you shouldn&#39;t avoid it out of radiation fears.</p>

<p>We have yet to conclusively prove that dosages below around 100 mSv cause cancer. For reference, a chest x-ray delivers about 0.1 mSv and an abdominal CT-scan can deliver around 10 mSv.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It looked like that examined observational evidence, right? What I cited was all experimental.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Let’s throw in proper hydration and sleep as well!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Sleep absolutely, forgot about that. I find dry fasting to be very nice and strengthening, but you should still properly rehydrate afterwards so proper hydration still applies. For instance I just got back from an hour in the sauna and I haven&#39;t had food or water in about 18 hours. Really cleans you out and feels refreshing. I&#39;ll eat and rehydrate in a few hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Personally, I’d never dry fast. I’m big into drinking tons of water and eating salt while I fast. But my job require standing for 8-10 hours straight and lifting weights during that time - it can be physically demanding. Have to give you props for dry fasting, I’d have a difficult time doing that.</p>

"
<div class="md"><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Studies on long-term sustainability of low-carbohydrate approaches to treat diabetes are limited. We previously reported the effectiveness of a novel digitally-monitored continuous care intervention (CCI) including nutritional ketosis in improving weight, glycemic outcomes, lipid, and liver marker changes at 1 year. Here, we assess the effects of the CCI at 2 years.</p>

<p><strong>Materials and methods</strong>: An open label, non-randomized, controlled study with 262 and 87 participants with T2D were enrolled in the CCI and usual care (UC) groups, respectively. Primary outcomes were retention, glycemic control, and weight changes at 2 years. Secondary outcomes included changes in body composition, liver, cardiovascular, kidney, thyroid and inflammatory markers, diabetes medication use and disease status.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>: Reductions from baseline to 2 years in the CCI group resulting from intent-to-treat analyses included: HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, weight, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and liver alanine transaminase, and HDL-C increased. Spine bone mineral density in the CCI group was unchanged. Use of any glycemic control medication (excluding metformin) among CCI participants declined (from 55.7 to 26.8%) including insulin (-62%) and sulfonylureas (-100%). The UC group had no changes in these parameters (except uric acid and anion gap) or diabetes medication use. There was also resolution of diabetes (reversal, 53.5%; remission, 17.6%) in the CCI group but not in UC. All the reported improvements had p &lt; 0.00012.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The CCI group sustained long-term beneficial effects on multiple clinical markers of diabetes and cardiometabolic health at 2 years while utilizing less medication. The intervention was also effective in the resolution of diabetes and visceral obesity with no adverse effect on bone health.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ketosis is a cure for diabetes, I think nobody can dispute this already.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;d have to qualify the term cure. The benefits last as long as you&#39;re on the diet, and some time after. Going back to old eating patterns reduces the benefits. Hence, a reversible cure</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My husband is a nurse (we both eat keto) and he sees a lot of diabetic patients. He works on a cardiac floor and the hospital policy is that diabetic patients should get &quot;at least&quot; 50 g of carbs per meal while in the hospital. He gets so upset seeing the meals (pancakes with maple syrup, pasta, rice, etc) and they will be pumping the patients full of insulin. </p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t understand how the doctors and other nurses are so blind to this. When he talks about eating keto himself he just gets lectured about how dangerous it is. There was a cardiologist on his floor who decided to eat a super high carb diet to lose weight??? Like what????? These are trained medical professionals in a major city in Canada!</p>

<p>So TL/DR:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ketosis is a cure for diabetes, I think nobody can dispute this already.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, people dispute this all the time, unfortunately. Very, very unfortunately. People are dying because of doctors, hospitals policymakers, and government officials disputing this.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Virta Health is careful to use the phrase &quot;remission&quot;.  Right now officially T2D is viewed as progressive and degenerative.  Getting the word out that actually if you eat yourself (it&#39;s food based, I think we all get that) into T2D, you have caused damage to your metabolic systems and their normal regulation. </p>

<p>While I think that keto can transition to low-carb for recovered T2D, we need long term data to know for sure.</p>

<p>Certainly going back to beer and pizza, donuts and breadsticks with pasta dinners, these things would likely result in regaining the T2D state.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Ok, I. An call it an antidote to diabetes, not a cure directly. It depends on how much poison do you consume.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>No, people dispute this all the time, unfortunately. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, sadly. Eventhough an overwhelming amount of science is already there, people try to prove their old broken dogmas work, because their world would shatter. Bias in medicine is literally killing thousands.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What&#39;s interesting is the treatment for T2D long before invention of medications was ketogenic style diets.  Check out this cookbook from 1917: <a href="https://archive.org/details/diabeticcookeryr00oppeiala">https://archive.org/details/diabeticcookeryr00oppeiala</a> (Diabetic Cookery by Rebecca Oppenheimer)</p>

<p>I think in the future, the 1950-now era is doing to be known as the dark ages of nutrition science.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>One big issue is that not everyone is willing to pursue a low carb diet even if it can greatly improve their health, due to preferences or cost. There is not point in putting every single person on a low carb diet, and tailoring a regime of insulin and oral drugs to control that diet in hospital, when they go back into the real world and eat completely differently. </p>

<p>That&#39;s already a big enough problem a it is. These diabetic hospital diets are still far less carbs then some of these people are eating at home. Then they go home and the regime that was working in hospital doesn&#39;t work at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It’s so sad 🙁 have seen it in the last year with 2 relatives.</p>
</div>

<p>Exactly! It breaks my heart! I wish there was something I could do, but there are already so many smart people (doctors, researchers, etc) speaking out already. People will only change once they&#39;re willing to listen.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I think in the future, the 1950-now era is doing to be known as the dark ages of nutrition science.</p>

<p>OMG! I can&#39;t agree more!! We&#39;re in the dark ages for sure! Lol! Hopefully enough people are starting to see the light that things will change soon</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>You have to differentiate people who are non-compliant with people told they HAVE TO eat (mostly refined!) carbohydrates at every meal.</p>

<p>There is every point to recommending at least low-carb to anyone who is even pre-diabetic.  When the diet recommended doesn&#39;t result in improvement - and the standard T2D does not - then patients lose faith that their doctors and the medical establishment knows anything useful about nutrition.  They&#39;re right, but then most people view keto as non-mainstream and reject it.</p>

<p>Virta Health is for profit, sure, same as doctors and big pharma, but what they are doing is cracking open that door just a little bit with clinical trials and clean data.  The word is out there that DOCTORS recommend keto and then it&#39;s just the fight to get insurance companies on board.</p>

<p>Going home and having telemedicine support is a game changer.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one of the topics in the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just as exciting is the fact that 74% of all patients who began the clinical trial were still taking part in the Virta Treatment. As context, 20% of new prescriptions for chronic diseases go unfilled, and among those filled, approximately 50% are taken incorrectly. In other words, our patients are more likely to follow the Virta Treatment than the average person is to just “take a pill”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ketogenic diets are easy to stick to <em>if</em> said person can get over the old and busted conventional wisdom.  The food choices are amazing - all the things mainstream &quot;experts&quot; recommend against are back on the menu: ribeye steak, chicken wings, bacon, butter, cheese, full fat dairy, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>These diabetic hospital diets are still far less carbs then some of these people are eating at home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That may be true for some of them, but in my husband&#39;s experience, these patients are complaining that they&#39;re struggling to control their blood sugar at the hospital. They have an easier time controling it at home. And these are not people who are low-carbers. </p>

<p>Either way, diabetes education needs to be severely improved. Patients, doctors and hospital dietitians need to be educated about the benefits of lower carbs to treat diabetes. Many people still believe that you&#39;ll die if you eat under 100 grams of carbs a day. It&#39;s so ridiculous!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Its an analogy.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>We are for sure on the right track!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I personally love those food choices, but I also love lemon squares so I had to learn how to cook with swerve..</p>

<p>The 20% of new Rx being unfilled is really interesting (and the 50% taking them wrong, how many are cutting dosage due to cost?  At least metformin is cheap.).</p>

<p>The 2 month results from Virta were a serious selling point, backed with the 2 year result.  It&#39;s like look, you can almost instantly get your BG down, lose some fat and lower your medications.  Two months.</p>

<p>Keep at it for two years and most people will be in complete remission.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Get a food scale and download a nutrition/calorie counting app. Learn what macronutrients (fat, carbs, protien) are in food, how much you should have of what, then look up what they do in the body. Then do the same thing with micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). You will learn a ton starting with the food you eat.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>For a broad view of the academic consensus on healthy eating, I recommend starting with the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/">public education materials provided by Harvard&#39;s School of Public Health</a>, including the back issues of their newsletter.</p>

<p>For individual essential micronutrients, the <a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic">Linus Pauling Center&#39;s Micronutrient Information Center</a> is a useful resource. </p>

<p>Lower down on the trust worthiness scale (there&#39;s some cherry picking), but heavily referenced, is <a href="http://www.whfoods.com/foodstoc.php">George Mateljan Foundation&#39;s World&#39;s Healthiest Foods</a> website.</p>

<p>Beyond that, one is headed either into more academic territory with textbooks (I reference <a href="https://b-ok.cc/book/2320751/23965f">Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease</a> all the time) or more biased sources favoring particular diets, including fad diets. Should you get obsessed, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">Pubmed</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Scholar</a> facilitate searching the literature.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The wiki for this sub</p>

<div class="md"><p>Wikipedia is a great resource. Just look up a vitamin on there and start learning! If you don’t know a word, look it up!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What is your science background? </p>

<p>I think that understanding the metabolic background of protein/fat/carbs is pretty important.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Is biochemistry a good place to start? Asking for myself. Especially if you want to stick to known facts (instead of say (biased) inferences from epidemiological studies)</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The Magic Pill.
Certainly, a lot of it is anecdotal, but the trial of Dr Noakes(?), really helped me realize that a lot of what we thought we knew about nutrition is based on bad science. It kind of gives you a clean foundation to start building on. Some people think it&#39;s a meat thing, but the basic principles are achievable for vegans as well, although it does require more dedication.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My rec is to watch ALL the food documentaries. Partially to understand that there are a lot of different opinions and often one is not more valid than the other. I would also recommend, if you have the inclination, whenever the documentary mentions something you find compelling, pause it and look it up yourself. There are a great deal of studies available free online, and I&#39;ve found statements before that are blatantly incorrect.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>known facts (instead of say (biased) inferences from epidemiological studies)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Biochemistry is great and all, and it does show that substance X in system Y does Z. However, we still are using model systems, which may not reflect what is going on &quot;in real life&quot;. For instance, even if our substance X (a nutritional compound found in some seeds) would theoretically act as a co-factor in an important cellular process a lot of things can go wrong: 1. Abosrbtion into the body might not go as expected (due to individual differences in transporters, &quot;anti-nutrients&quot;, or cooking method hindering it). 2. Even if absorbed, and if reaching the site of the organ we are interested in, there might be another factor interfering with binding (an enzyme, or just some signalling molecule interfering with the binding) that we didn&#39;t include in our model system. 3. Even if binding happens as expected in our target organ to our target receptor (as modeled) the downstreams effects may not be what we expected due to completely incalculable factors (some gene changes happening, some other changes it does in an other organ inhibiting pathways etc. etc.)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Oops a bit long comment. My point with this is that biochemistry will tell you how things &quot;work&quot; in a very limited way. I love it, and I love understanding the pathways involved with different things. But even for very targeted drugs we have unexpected reactions... For something with relatively vague binding profiles like nutritional compounds it&#39;s even more difficult to predict or understand the &quot;facts&quot; as such. That&#39;s why we need (good) epidemiological studies. We can&#39;t do large scale perfect placebo-controlled trials for everything, and need to know what to look at! Biochemistry may provide a mechanism, but they do not provide the context.  </p>

<p>Just so you know where I&#39;m coming from: I&#39;ve done quite some cellular science stuff and only have a vague understanding of epidemiology (more drug research stuff, but some nutrition too).</p>

<p>the trial of Dr Noakes(?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting. More about this in wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In February 2014 a registered dietician complained to the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) that Noakes tweeted to a mother that she should wean her baby onto low-carbohydrate, high-fat foods, which he described as real foods. The HPCSA held a hearing about the allegation against Noakes over the next few years. Controversially, on 28 October 2016, the HPSCA incorrectly released a statement announcing that Noakes had been found guilty of misconduct. In a second press release issued over three hours later, the HPSCA apologised for the mistake.[14] Noakes was cleared of misconduct in April 2017.[15][16] The HPSCA lost its appeal in June 2018.<br/>
[..]<br/>
Noakes co-wrote the 2017 book Lore of Nutrition with journalist Marika Sboros.[19] In it Noakes describes his Damascene conversion to low-carbohydrate dieting, explores how the lipid hypothesis is the &quot;biggest mistake in modern medicine&quot; and details his struggles with the medical establishment.<br/>

<div class="md"><p>It also lists Denise Minger, Gary Taubes, and Weston A Price. I would love it if all the nonscientific sources including Forks Over Knives were removed.</p>

<div class="md"><p>As the other poster said, we have quite a few low-carb and low-plant sources as well.  We attempted to include materials from all sides.  From a perusal of your link, Food Lies has not yet been released so I am not surprised it hasn&#39;t been added yet.  I wouldn&#39;t personally add a source that hasn&#39;t been examined by at least a few mods.</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Perhaps we could consider adding some disclaimers to the descriptions of certain books and documentaries?  There is literally no author, book, doctor, or documentary that someone somewhere won&#39;t claim is biased in one way or another so our &#39;Recommended Reading&#39; and &#39;Recommended Documentaries&#39; sections would be entirely empty if we excluded every source that different people felt was biased.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>that would be amazing, at least this sub should be a last bastion on reddit versus the pop nutritional scientists of the various plant-based, keto and carnivore religions.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Bias isn&#39;t the problem so much as poor and misleading science. There are researchers who could write an evidence based book about low-carb diets and their usefulness for weight loss and diabetes management. But Gary Taubes is a journalist whose ideas have been shown time and time again by the scientific community to <a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/gary-taubes-and-the-cause-of-obesity/">be</a> <a href="https://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2011/08/carbohydrate-hypothesis-of-obesity.html">completely</a> <a href="https://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2011/08/carbohydrate-hypothesis-of-obesity.html">wrong</a>. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if any documentaries should be on the recommendation list of a place called &quot;scientific nutrition&quot;. Not only are they always biased, but they are created by people who have even less scientific knowledge than most authors, and they don&#39;t even have references.</p>

<p>Is there a free university intro to nutrition course available online? That would be a good recommendation. Maybe <a href="http://ocw.jhsph.edu/index.cfm/go/viewCourse/course/HumanNutrition/coursePage/index/">this?</a></p>

<p>While <em>I</em> agree with that statement, the Wiki is editable by any mod and therefore each mod has made different contributions as time has gone by.  I have asked the other mods for further input so I would expect to see some other mod comments here in the next day or two.</p>

<p>MOOC-list has <a href="https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/food-nutrition">a good list</a> of free online nutrition-related courses.  I can talk with the other mods and see about adding that to the Wiki!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I’m totally open to changing the wiki. We want to make it a starting point for people who are new to learning about nutrition science. We will consider any suggestions to improve it, including this one.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The book list will mature over time. Those types of lists are the default things added to wikis, and it&#39;s natural the mods added books they&#39;ve personally read. The list is perhaps a bit stale now since most of us are now skipping the books and reading original research. But anyone is free to send the mods a message with their recommendations.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Ketone bodies are the most energy-efficient fuel and yield more ATP per mole of substrate than pyruvate and increase the free energy released from ATP hydrolysis. Elevation of circulating ketones via high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets has been used for the treatment of drug-refractory epilepsy and for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson&#39;s disease. Ketones may also be beneficial for muscle and brain in times of stress, such as endurance exercise. The challenge has been to raise circulating ketone levels by using a palatable diet without altering lipid levels. We found that blood ketone levels can be increased and cholesterol and triglycerides decreased by feeding rats a novel ketone ester diet: chow that is supplemented with (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate as 30% of calories. For 5 d, rats on the ketone diet ran 32% further on a treadmill than did control rats that ate an isocaloric diet that was supplemented with either corn starch or palm oil (P &lt; 0.05). Ketone-fed rats completed an 8-arm radial maze test 38% faster than did those on the other diets, making more correct decisions before making a mistake (P &lt; 0.05). Isolated, perfused hearts from rats that were fed the ketone diet had greater free energy available from ATP hydrolysis during increased work than did hearts from rats on the other diets as shown by using [31P]-NMR spectroscopy. The novel ketone diet, therefore, improved physical performance and cognitive function in rats, and its energy-sparing properties suggest that it may help to treat a range of human conditions with metabolic abnormalities.</p>

<p>No reason they cant. Probably chose rat model because its cheaper and easier to control confounding variables.</p>

<p>anecdotally many report better mental function, there are plausible mechanistic reasons to believe this. There was a recent study showing no change in mental function on &quot;Healthy&quot; Humans so this may be dependent on some prior dysfunction that keto resolves or to short study time not allowing for proper fat adaption which could take as long as 3-6 months. </p>

<p>On the performance side  there are some long distance runners who are dominating using a ketogenic diet. </p>

<p>On the more explosive side i would say that currently the evidence points to unchanged performance or negative.  </p>

<p>My own theory is that keto will probably improve recovery which could help with many performance related things. Keto for explosive performance probably require higher protein intake than what is typically recommended one example of this is Shawn Baker who is Doing extremely well in a highly glycolytic activity (short distance rowing).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Edit: Someone pointed out that there&#39;s always glucose in your blood and I agree. We&#39;re talking about DIETARY glucose here. Gluconeogenesis is a thing that your body does because you NEED some levels of glucose. I&#39;m talking about having LOW levels of glucose such that your insulin is lowered and therefore ketosis can occur. I don&#39;t say you will finish every last drop in your blood. I mean that your insulin to glucagon ratio drops to a level that allows ketosis to occur.</p>

<p>It is my unpopular belief that once you have enough glucose in your bloodstream to cause <strong>an insulin response</strong>, it&#39;s the same as having alcohol in your system. Hear me out...</p>

<p>Ketosis is the natural state for humans (according to Amber Hearn) which we evolved to adapt to the most recent ice age. We still have the ability to process other fuel sources but fats are the best (as evidenced by your study showing how ketones are more efficient).</p>

<p>When you eat carbs/sugar, your body stops trying to burn fats and preferentially chooses glucose instead. But what if we change the wording and say, &quot;Your body stops burning fats in order to get rid of sugars first&quot; ? When you&#39;re not burning sugar, your body increases autophagy and studies are showing that we increase stem cell production. In my mind, that is equivalent to &quot;<strong>sugars suppress autophagy and stem cell production.</strong>&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>You always have glucose in your bloodstream</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>That’s very unscientific for a subreddit called scientific nutrition. You’re certainly entitled to your belief, but what evidence do you present to suggest it has merit?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The pathway to ketosis is regulated by the ratio of insulin to glucagon. For this one, I&#39;m going to reference a video by researcher Dr. Benjamin Bikman PhD - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3fO5aTD6JU">&#39;Insulin vs. Glucagon: The relevance of dietary protein&#39;</a>. I&#39;m going to trust that the actual studies that he references in there are legit.</p>

<p>He explains in the video that when eating a diet with carbohydrates that protein has an effect on insulin. There is a slide where insulin goes up by as much as 40x. But when you cut out carbs, protein does not have the same effect on insulin - insulin remains pretty much the same (in healthy, non-obese individuals*). The ultimate takeaway  is that when insulin goes down, ketosis goes up. </p>

<p>For fun, he poses a challenge. He says that the only cells that don&#39;t have mitochondria are red blood cells. Your brain cells all have mitochondria and therefore don&#39;t actually NEED glucose. He said that he&#39;s never seen a study proving it.</p>

<p>It is not needed, but glucose is the preferred fuel for the brain. This is why it only transitions to ketones when glucose availability is low</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>There are cellular functions that require glucose. That doesn’t mean you need dietary glucose. That’s why gluconeogenesis is a thing</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I want to declare upfront that I did not have the time thus far to read this verbatim.</p>

<p>Your second article is specific to fasting which is not a ketogenic diet. Though there may be some overlap, the article specifically addresses periods of not eating - not what happens when we eat. </p>

<p>I’m not sure I buy the idea that we evolved to be ketogenic as a primary energy process. We are <em>very</em>  good at using carbohydrates as a primary energy source. I haven’t seen any credible evidence to support that.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>But that was my original hypothesis. The alternative perspective is that glucose is not preferred by actually less desirable. Hence my comparison to alcohol.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying that alcohol is the preferred fuel for the liver which is why your liver prioritizes alcohol first. See what I mean?</p>

<p>Your brain (and all cells) prioritize glucose. It is maybe an evolutionary adaptation to try finish using exogenous energy sources and only switch to fat burning once that fuel is complete. But just because it uses it up first doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s the ideal fuel.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Ethanol is preferred fuel over glucose so therefore we should mainly fuel our self with alcohol...</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Work looking at Alzheimer&#39;s and exogenous ketones shows the brain will take up ketones even in the presence of glucose - and use it for fuel.</p>

<p>Also &quot;In contrast, several studies show that brain ketone uptake increases in direct proportion to the rise in blood ketone concentrations, irrespective of brain activity(Blomqvistet al.,1995,2002; Cunnaneet al.,2011; Nugentet al.,2014b). &quot;  <a href="https://www.ocl-journal.org/articles/ocl/pdf/2016/01/ocl150017.pdf">https://www.ocl-journal.org/articles/ocl/pdf/2016/01/ocl150017.pdf</a></p>

<div class="md"><p>Hold on - you&#39;re arguing about that? My original comment was about dietary glucose. Read the wording again please - I specifically used the following words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>When you eat carbs/sugar</strong>, your body stops trying to burn fats and preferentially chooses glucose instead.</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>So why do we experience things like post lunch drowsiness with carbs (even protein from carnivore diets) and not keto?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Interesting thoughts! </p>

<p>I want to add some quotes from how this topic is described in research. Overall, we see the term &quot;alternative fuel source&quot; being used a lot. And ketone bodies are described as &quot;sparing&quot; carbohydrates. If the argument is that ketones are superior, why are they described as a carb-sparing, alternative fuel source for times of starvation/fasting/low carb? Basically, a backup solution (albeit the diet can have many advantages)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The evolutionary effect of ketone bodies is therefore to spare carbohydrate reserves, and muscle protein, whilst themselves being an alternative energy source.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike most other tissues, the brain cannot utilize fatty acids for energy when blood glucose levels become compromised.

<div class="md"><p>I looked up your claim and there seem to be some nuances:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Brain metabolism may partially include acetate as a by-product of ethanol</p></li>
<li><p>The brain does not <em>prefer</em> ethanol from what I could find</p></li>
<li><p>We should not fuel the brain with alcohol daily as it will lead to serious health degradation, something which cannot be said for glucose</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>These findings corroborate our hypothesis that heavy alcohol consumption facilitates use of alternative energy substrates (i.e., acetate) for resting activity during intoxication, which might persist through early sobriety, but indicate that <strong>glucose is still favored as energy substrate during brain stimulation</strong>. Our findings are consistent with reduced reliance on glucose as the main energy substrate for resting brain metabolism during intoxication (<strong>presumably shifting to acetate or other ketones</strong>) and a priming of this shift in HDs, which might make them vulnerable to energy deficits during withdrawal.</p>

<p>There are two scenarios where I can vividly recall feeling like shit post meal - 1) eating a couple of slices of a cake - tons of highly refined carbs. 2) eating a meal that was probably 75% fat (30+ grams). </p>

<p>I am only one anecdotal piece of data, but I find that eating lots of whole grains, fruits and vegetables makes me feel absolutely amazing. For that, I am of the opinion that large volumes of fiber are the difference.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Disclaimer:  I debated posting this since it&#39;s a hot-button issue but then I recalled that the one of the primary reasons for this sub is to post interesting and useful analyses of nutrition research.  Since these types of discussions usually lead to some heated comments, I am adding this disclaimer in the hopes that we all keep our chill here.  It&#39;s entirely fair to agree or disagree with the conclusions of the article and analysis is always encouraged!</p>

<p>EDIT: As <a href="/u/flowersandmtns">/u/flowersandmtns</a> helpfully pointed out, these studies have also been discussed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bmgktg/glucose_and_lipid_homeostasis_and_inflammation_in/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bwq6z1/effects_of_red_meat_white_meat_and_nonmeat/">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>There are few interesting tidbits from the article but the section discussing the increased CRP on the keto diet has a reasonable conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is reasonable therefore to regard the effect of the ketogenic diet on CRP as potentially real. This is important, because although professional cardiovascular disease researchers believe both lipids and inflammation are important for cardiovascular disease (and other factors) inflammation is frequently proposed as the sole cause of cardiovascular disease by many non-scientist advocates of low-carbohydrate diets. Yet, if both harmful lipids and major inflammatory markers like CRP are increased on a low-carbohydrate diet, then this poses a problem for the claim that low-carbohydrate dieting is innocuous for cardiovascular disease risk.</p>

<p><strong>To be clear, for many people, most markers of cardiovascular disease risk (including LDL cholesterol and CRP) will decrease on a low-carbohydrate diet if weight loss is robust enough (see, e.g., here and here). However, what the studies above suggest is that if weight is maintainable at these lower levels after switching to a higher-carbohydrate diet, on average these lipid and inflammatory markers will improve still further. A key unresolved question is whether the ability to maintain such weight loss on a low-carbohydrate diet sufficiently compensates for the increases in these cardiovascular disease markers, if long-term weight maintenance on a low-carbohydrate diet is preferred. I suspect that it is–and thus, for those who can only maintain their weight loss on a low-carbohydrate diet, the tradeoff may on balance be worthwhile. But this remains to be seen. (Also, this may depend on the extent of the weight loss. More long-term weight loss would more likely justify the tradeoff.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Both studies have been discussed here and neither is accurately reflected in the breathless title of that &quot;Nutritional Evolution&quot; blog.</p>

<p>First study was looking at a 4 week keto diet and then a challenge meal.  Yes, we know LDL is often raised on a keto diet.  Let&#39;s focus on that instead of the higher HDL, lower trigs, lower BG, lower insulin and weight loss.  Also the rise in inflammation markers was in response to a refined carb meal. </p>

<p>Second study is the red vs white meat study.</p>

<p>Their summary is &quot;According to these studies, because low-carbohydrate diets high in meat  and saturated fat are likely to, on average, raise both inflammatory and  lipid biomarkers in healthy people&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s not quite entirely accurate though.  And I&#39;m irritated they keep harping on &quot;high in meat&quot; rather than &quot;high in fat&quot; because it makes them seem like they have a vegan agenda and don&#39;t actually understand nutritional ketosis.</p>

<p>Without the challenge meal, a keto diet lowers inflammation markers.  Without the challenge meal, a keto diet lowers trigs and does raise BOTH LDL and HDL.  </p>

<p>They go on, &quot;–if avoiding atherosclerosis is the  goal, then minimizing animal-sourced protein while maximizing other  high-nutrient foods is likely to be best practice according to the  totality of current evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah so this isn&#39;t about a high-fat diet at all, really, it&#39;s about animal products.  Got it.</p>

<p>&quot;There may be plausible arguments in favor  of low-carbohydrate diets if they help to maintain a sufficient degree  of weight loss to mitigate the inflammatory or lipid effects of these  diets.&quot;</p>

<p>Ok great!  Or, you know, if overall inflammation is lowered, which is is.  And if low trigs and high HDL are good, which they are.  </p>

<p>&quot; Likewise, among persons with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, the  euglycemic effects of low-carbohydrate diets may outweigh any negatives. &quot;</p>

<p>Exactly.  There are a LOT of people with T2D and pre-diabetes out there.</p>

<p>&quot;However, all else equal, it may be appropriate to exercise caution  about committing to low-carbohydrate diets if weight and glucose can be  optimally maintained with other dietary strategies.&quot;</p>

<p>I disagree, and their arguments aren&#39;t well made to support their view.</p>

<p>Oh!  This is the guy who posted about &quot;<a href="https://nutritionalrevolution.org/2019/05/18/macronutrients-part-3/">The  data do not support the idea that the low-fat dietary guidelines caused  the obesity epidemic. (A reply to Dr. Ludwig’s response–Part 3 in the  macronutrient trend series.)</a>&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The increased CRP in the study cited was in response to a high-CHO meal (one meal, probably reasonably decent).  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3845365/">Consuming a hypocaloric high fat low carbohydrate diet for 12 weeks lowers C-reactive protein, and raises serum adiponectin and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol in obese subjects</a></p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&quot;Additionally, in our Virta/IUH study of patients with type 2 diabetes,  both WBC count and CRP were dramatically reduced in the ketogenic diet  group compared to the usual care group at 1 and 2-year follow-up (27,  28). In particular, the reduction in CRP in the ketogenic diet group at 1  year was comparable in magnitude (35-40%) to what is seen with the most  potent statin drug.&quot;  <a href="https://blog.virtahealth.com/inflammation-ketosis-diabetes/">https://blog.virtahealth.com/inflammation-ketosis-diabetes/</a></p>

<p>Furthermore looking at that study focused on the KD diet lower C-reactive protein in response to that one meal, the KD diet group had an expected higher BG after the one meal because of the known effect of physiological glucose sparing.  More interesting to me is that BOTH groups had MINIMAL BG responses to the KD meal and LOWER insulin response! (Figure 1).  </p>

<p>For T2D, which is characterized by hyperinsulinemia, the paper shows a KD meal is far better in terms of glucose excursions and insulin requirements by the body.</p>

<p>High meat is specified because low-carb/keto is possible with varying amounts of meat. Even meatless ketogenic diets are possible. Low-carb diets with less meat do not have the same effects on lipid profiles.</p>

<p>No arguments are necessary. I&#39;m reporting the data. A ketogenic diet (the Hall study) raised CRP and LDL. High-meat and high-SFA (the Krauss study) both independently raised LDL vs. their lower-meat, lower-SFA counterparts. You can cite weight loss studies or harp on whatever, but from a weight-maintaining point of view, the data are clear. As far as I can tell, the only question is whether weight maintenance (at an optimal bodyweight, that is) is achievable for a given person on a higher-carbohydrate intake. If it is, then all else equal and on average, these biomarker results would point to a lower-meat, lower-SFA, higher-carb diet as being optimal. I&#39;m also not a vegan, as I try to stay away from extremes. I&#39;ve done keto several times and plan to do it again. I was also low-carb for 10 years. All of this is irrelevant though, or should be. Let us make this about the science, not our egos or dietary preferences.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thank you for your summary. I don’t understand how these studies make it to this subreddit, they are so blatantly confirming a bias. I just want to add the following:</p>

<p>However, all else equal, it may be appropriate to exercise caution about committing to low-carbohydrate diets if weight and glucose can be optimally maintained with other dietary strategies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what’s wrong with, and touches on the core cognitive dissonance in nutritional advice given to diabetics. When you have a disease related to an inability to tolerate a substance, you do everything you can to omit that substance. </p>

<p>Therefore it would seem logical to do away with or limit carbs if your are diabetic. Every diabetic knows (or should know) how to count carbs. In some cases you can manage a high carbohydrate diet with medication; at least one would assume so by the discrete intervals the are measured. But these are the exceptions that place everyone who can’t into danger. Insulin efficiency has a serious margin of error, and the law of large numbers applies. However, there is still a delay before any medication has an effect. In that brief window, you’re wreaking havoc on your micro vascular system. </p>

<p>It is generally accepted that every diabetic will face complications in their lifetimes. I argue that it’s due to the quoted advice above and the common misconception of “just bolus for it” that complications are still rampant. Obviously they don’t mention which methods, but I haven’t encountered any other effective ones other than the very one they deter from.</p>

<p>That was a weight-loss study and the Bass analysis is discussing effects during weight maintenance.

<p>You were looking at weight maintenance then?  Hall&#39;s study was isocaloric so that makes sense and generally studies about keto are looking at weight loss.  Even when trying to be isocaloric people tend to lose weight on a KD.  I&#39;ll see if there are other studies about KD that are isocaloric and look at inflammation (though they tend to be in elite level athletes and not so applicable to mere mortals who like to exercise).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4038351/">What causes the insulin resistance underlying obesity?
</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Work to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the relationship between obesity and insulin resistance in humans continues to support the concept that visceral obesity, but not subcutaneous, results in insulin resistance and increased risk of T2DM. <strong>The mechanisms by which visceral obesity results in insulin resistance appear to be related to excess lipid accumulation in liver. This may be due to excess fatty acids from visceral adipose tissue draining into the portal vein. Excess lipid accumulation may result in impaired insulin signaling through cell autonomous mechanisms, or through the induction of inflammation and the subsequent production of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, which impair insulin action.</strong> Storage of excess fat in subcutaneous depots mitigates the risk of insulin resistance and T2DM, possibly by preventing accumulation of fat in visceral adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle. Thus, the mechanisms that determine the size and expandability of subcutaneous adipose tissue depots, such as the control of extracellular matrix and capillary expansion, may be important targets for future therapy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4587882/">The role of fatty acids in insulin resistance</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It appears that insulin resistance starts in the hypothalamus causing a disruption in the balance of satiety and hunger signals. This leads to overconsumption of calories. <strong>Although excess calories can be theoretically stored safely in the adipose tissue, as the inflammation increases in this organ and insulin resistance develops in the fat cells, the ability to safely store excess fat is compromised. One of the consequences of insulin resistance in the adipose tissue is that excess fat is released into the blood stream and is sequestered by other organs (liver and skeletal muscles) that are not equipped to safely store this excess fat. This is the start of lipotoxicity. With increased lipotoxicity, the metabolism and energy generation becomes compromised, and the development of chronic diseases (diabetes, heart disease, and polycystic ovary syndrome) associated with insulin resistance becomes accelerated. The levels of fat in the diet and the composition of those fatty acids in the fat component can have a significant role in the modulation of insulin resistance.</strong></p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>Weight was lost on both BD and KD. It wasn&#39;t a characteristic unique to the KD phase. The researchers made a mistake and underestimated energy expenditure at baseline. People do not lose weight on isocaloric KD when protein is the same. Weight loss on KD is comparable to weight loss on other high-quality diets, so studies that show CRP improvement with large amount of weight loss are confounded by the weight loss. The idea is to identify the best diet for weight loss or weight loss maintenance, from a biomarker point of view.</p>

<p>Both of those are &quot;may&quot;, meaning they are guessing/hypothesizing.</p>

<p>There&#39;s work showing REMOVING fat from the liver is causal with sugar/fructose consumption, which to me says it&#39;s not fat consumption related.

This study was designed to be weight-maintaining (though it underestimated energy expenditure at baseline and weight was lost on both BD and KD). Can you show me a study that was weight-maintaining that showed a reduction in CRP, or didn&#39;t show an increase? To repeat, it is critically important to evaluate nutrition studies on the basis of whether weight is lost; even modest weight loss profoundly improves most health markers, independently of how that weight was lost. This includes CRP; it is flawed to conclude that KD improves CRP in a study with massive weight loss. KD does not produce superior weight loss compared to other high-quality diets when good meta-analysis methods are used, therefore weight loss should not be considered a characteristic of KD in contrast with other high-quality diets, therefore weight loss is a CONFOUNDER.</p>

<p>My only issue with that study is that it doesn&#39;t tell us anything we don&#39;t already know, mainly that refined liquid sugar is worse for you than complex carbohydrates.  I mean, it&#39;s always good to have &#39;proof&#39; but there is literally no one anywhere that is recommending a diet comprised of 25% liquid fructose.  It would have been (to me) more interesting if they had tested a 25% fructose diet comprised of real food (which could only be done with large amounts of fruit I imagine).  At least then we could see what happens when someone is consuming large amounts of a food group that is traditionally considered very healthy (fruits).</p>

<p>My point is rather than worrying about fat, especially since you aren’t differentiating between any types of fat (yes, there are good fats that do not contribute to the metabolic syndrome), diabetics should be focusing on reducing carbs. </p>

<p>Insulin is <em>also</em> a growing hormone <em>and</em> a fat storing hormone. It is still triggered by carbs. Insulin resistance has a number of causes, and while you should stay away from bad fats, the main dietary cause will still be too many carbs.</p>

<p>In the absence of doing something so unneeded and irrelevent, one can look at insulin levels and BG levels in people following a LCHF diet and the result is lowered insulin and stable BG levels.</p>

<p>The primary concern with &quot;insulin resistance&quot; is high blood glucose in response to consuming carbohydrates and the significant damage to the body (heart, eyes, brain, nerves, etc).  High insulin as a response to insulin resistance with carbohydrate in the diet has it&#39;s own set of damage.</p>

<p>If BG is low and stable, there is no concern regarding the sensitivity to insulin in the body.  Insulin is not being used to manage intake of glucose that has to then be cleared from the blood.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that the KD used in this study, as well as in other studies in mice (2–4, 25), may differ from KD used in humans.

Also, in humans, low-carbohydrate diets usually result in decreased caloric intake (16, 30), which was not observed here and, thus, demonstrates the differences between humans and mice in the metabolic adaptations to such diets. However, these data clearly offer perspectives for research in dietary manipulations aimed at treating obesity.</p>

<p>IF someone sees raised LDL -- and you ignore that many people on LCHF see lowered LDL of course -- then adjusting the fat type can be helpful.  With the massive benefits demonstrated from a LCHF/keto diet, overall losing weight and having normalized BG (results are far better than found with very low fat/high whole carb diets, which I am able to accept are also useful I&#39;ll add), and since LDL is only associative with CVD relative risk factors, people with T2D should be informed of ALL choices.</p>

Because the LCKD can be very effective at lowering blood  glucose, patients on diabetes medication who use this diet should be  under close medical supervision or capable of adjusting their  medication.&quot;  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1325029/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1325029/</a></p>

<p>But if you gave these people who lost bodyfat, lowered their trigs and BG, a giant freaking drink of pure glucose they will show as &quot;insulin resistant&quot;.  Who freaking cares.</p>

<p>What the real goal here?  Is it health?  Sure doesn&#39;t seem like it.</p>

<p>Oh and the people who GOT OFF T2D MEDS?  This was their diet &quot;Initially, participants were allowed unlimited amounts of meats,  poultry, fish, shellfish, and eggs; 2 cups of salad vegetables per day; 1  cup of low-carbohydrate vegetables per day; 4 ounces of hard cheese;  and limited amounts of cream, avocado, olives, and lemon juice. Fats and  oils were not restricted except that intake of <em>trans</em> fats was to be minimized.&quot;</p>

<div class="md"><p>No, you moved them by claiming the best thing to do is stop eating fat. Stop eating carbs if you are diabetic, it will eventually improve your insulin sensitivity. Yes, it might increase insulin resistance in the shorter term, but since you aren’t eating a significant amount you don’t have to worry about that. In the long term, when the body adapts, you will be able to tolerate carbs better. I know I can a high carb meal without issues now, but don’t take it from my n=1:</p>

<p>This study shows lower insulin resistance after 4 weeks

<p>They didn’t measure insulin sensitivity directly, they used a proxy measure which would be fine except for the fact that it’s never been validated in the context of a low carb study. The low fat study also had an increase in cholesterol levels suggesting they didn&#39;t increase fiber or decrease saturated fat </p>

<p>High carb, very very low fat diets do not, in the studies done so far, have the reductions in FBG and HbA1c found with studies on keto.  They work, of course, but when HbA1c is still elevated the person is still at risk for all the deadly complications of T2D.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not at all false that LDL is only one factor of many in CVD.  T2D is a major factor and with LCHF the diebetic state is in remission -- NORMAL BG, why do you avoid acknowledging how significant this is?  What do you think caused that raised FMD in the study you cited?  It was high BG!  So any diet that keeps BG in the normal range, with of course also low trigs and high HDL, the LDL levels being normal is going to result in an overall lowered risk of CVD.   Meanwhile the kidneys, the eyes, the peripheral nerves are benefitting in a way that is not found with other dietary programs suggested for T2D.  That&#39;s why the ADA now endorses low-carb.</p>

<p>Why are you specifying “very very low fat”? I’ve only advocated for reducing saturated fat to very low levels, total fat up to 35% is fine. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is the one prerequisite when reduced makes other factors irrelevant in regards to atherosclerosis. There are many things that cause endothelial dysfunction, including hyperglycemia, but with low levels of LDL you will not have atherosclerosis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NORMAL BG, why do you avoid acknowledging how significant this is?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you can achieve normal BG in other ways that won’t cause heart disease </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you think caused that raised FMD in the study you cited? It was high BG!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the high BG was because they were insulin resistant. You shouldn’t be hyperglycemic every time you eat carbs if you are healthy. Healthy humans don’t have to avoid an entire macronutrient </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Do you have causal evidence that this will reverse atherosclerosis? </p>

<p>Kempner reversed diabetic retinopathy using a diet of 90% carbs that included white rice, sugar, and juice. It’s overkill and unnecessary but it proves that limiting carbs is not necessary to reverse the underlying causes of diabetes. Trading diabetes for heart disease is foolish</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The best results with HbA1c and BG were keto.  It won&#39;t CAUSE heart disease either.  It&#39;s not a trade, its remission of T2D and insignificant relative risks for CVD (if that).  You know what is a high risk for CVD?  DIABETES.</p>

<p>Whats with you and Kempner?  The guy did some work in the 1950s, with poor methodology.  No one supports that diet 70 years later.  No one followed up with it in future research. I guess they didn&#39;t want to have to beat subjects like Kempner did.
There&#39;s no current research on it. He had a lot of anecdotes and scandals.  You take anecdotes and make these sweeping statements like it was statistically significant as a way of addressing retinopathy when it wasn&#39;t.  [Edit: I see, it was a diet of rice and limited fruit, so totally boring. People essentially fasted, from his own figures the caloric intake is hypocaloric.  It&#39;s not about rice and it&#39;s not about carbs, it&#39;s about fasting which we all know has significant benefits. Oh, and it had almost no salt.]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the high BG was because they were insulin resistant. You shouldn’t be hyperglycemic every time you eat carbs if you are healthy. Healthy humans don’t have to avoid an entire macronutrient</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have T2D you SHOULD NOT be eating the macro that results in retinopathy, and not having carbs means normal BG.  T2D are by definition NOT NORMAL, so obviously addressing their inability to manage carbohydrates is of high concern.</p>

<p>Your view of normal is also narrow and restricted.  Ketosis is normal, too.  It&#39;s normal for the body to make ketones. It&#39;s normal for the body to be in glucose sparing when it ketosis.  This is all normal.</p>

<p>If someone (without T2D) is in ketosis for a  month and then spends a week having whole food carbs, they&#39;ll pass that useless OGTT.  It&#39;s meaningless to someone in ketosis though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This meta-analysis showed that <strong>moderate consumption of red/
white wine could effectively reduce the DBP and TC in T2DM
patients, but the SBP, glucose parameters and other lipid-associated measurements did not present significant differences</strong> in
these individuals. Although Koppes et al reported that alcohol
consumption is associated with a lower risk of mortality and coronary heart disease in type 2 diabetic population in their meta-analysis concerning observational studies,[18] we found different
results. To our best knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to
estimate the relationship between wine consumption with glucose
parameters and cardiovascular risk factors, by combining all
available randomized interventional trials up to date. Further
ROB evaluation, sensitivity, and publication bias tests provided
additional support for the robustness of our results. Although
heterogeneity is prevalent in the analysis, results from sensitivity
indicate that the overall effect size evaluations did not vary
substantially during exclusion of each study.</p>

<p>Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature
morbidity and mortality and its prevalence increased in DM.
People with hypertension and established cardiovascular diseases
are at particular high risk in general population.[19,20] Therefore,
the management of elevated BP is a critical component of the
comprehensive clinical management of diabetes. Previous study
had revealed that in well-controlled type 2 diabetic individuals
moderate red wine drinking could raise awake BP and lower
asleep BP.[15] <strong>Among our findings, the association between wine
intake and DBP reduction was significant, while the SBP showed
no significant differences in wine group and controls. Although
the present finding did not show significant decrease in SBP,
which is consistent with the general trend from various wine
consumption trials.[12,17] This inconsistency might be attributed
to the fact that we just pooled the average BP in our analysis, but the wine drinking affects BP differently between individual hours
across the 24-hours trajectory.[10] Owing to insufficient data we
could not do pooled analysis on BP changes based specific hours.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We observed no impact of wine on glycemic control by
monitoring FG, FI, and HbAc1% level.</strong> Some prior studies
reported the same results with ours, such as Napoli et al and Mori
et al who also did not found differences between wine group and
controls in FG, FI, and HbAc1%.[9,13] However, other organizations drew different conclusion by reporting that the level of FI
decreased after 1-year red wine intervention, otherwise no
significant differences were observed in FG, HbAc1%.[12,16] The
discrepancy could come from the differences in study participants, study design, the beverage type (red or white wine) and
approaches to measurement of insulin sensitivity.[15,21,22]</p>

<p>Individuals with T2DM have coexistent dyslipidemia characterized by increased TGs and reduced HDLC.[23,24] In contrast to
the well-documented effects of alcohol in healthy individuals to
increase HDL cholesterol. W<strong>e observed no changes in serum
HDL cholesterol with red wine relative to water or no drinking in
diabetic patients.</strong> In a multicenter randomized clinical intervention trial, diabetic subjects consuming red wine that diabetic
subjects consuming 13 g alcohol containing 13 g alcohol daily for
3 months showed no increase in HDL cholesterol and decrease in
LDL cholesterol and TG.[17] Whereas <strong>the level of TC was reduced
in diabetic subjects drinking wine in our meta-analysis.</strong> The likely
explanation for inconsistency among studies is related to the wine
dose or duration or to unique characteristics of the study
population.</p>

<p>From a physiologic perspective I can see why wine would improve blood pressure due to reductions in stress/anxiety but the total cholesterol reduction is a bit surprising.  Perhaps it&#39;s related to the polyphenols?  Or a substitution effect of wine replacing other dietary components that would have increased TC?</p>

<p>Could be a little of both, but I&#39;ve been doing a bit of drinking lately (for the first time in years) and it does replace some of the calories in my diet rather than adding more calories. There could be some benefit from replacing snacks in the diet with wine, which is essentially low-sugar fruit juice.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I remember exogenous polyphenols (or was it anti-oxidants... or resveratol? I&#39;m senile) not having a significant effect due to low bioavailability/absorption compared to endogenous production.</p>

<p>apart from the possible benefits however, is regular consumption of alcohol (as contained in red wine) not neurotoxic at all or liver-damaging at all?</p>

<p>Abstract: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is <strong>to determine the effectiveness of probiotic supplementation on clinical symptoms, weight loss, glycemic control, lipid and hormonal profiles, and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).</strong> Eligible studies were systematically searched from Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, and Web of Science databases until January 2019. Cochran (Q) and I-square statistics were used to measure heterogeneity among included studies. Data were pooled by using random-effect model and expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Eleven articles were included in this meta-analysis. Probiotic supplementation significantly decreased weight (SMD - 0.30; 95% CI, - 0.53, - 0.07; P = 0.01), body mass index (BMI) (SMD - 0.29; 95% CI, - 0.54, - 0.03; P = 0.02), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (SMD - 0.26; 95% CI, - 0.45, - 0.07; P &lt; 0.001), insulin (SMD - 0.52; 95% CI, - 0.81, - 0.24; P &lt; 0.001), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (SMD - 0.53; 95% CI, - 0.79, - 0.26; P &lt; 0.001), triglycerides (SMD - 0.69; 95% CI, - 0.99, - 0.39; P &lt; 0.001), VLDL-cholesterol (SMD - 0.69; 95% CI, - 0.99, - 0.39; P &lt; 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (SMD - 1.26; 95% CI, - 2.14, - 0.37; P &lt; 0.001), malondialdehyde (MDA) (SMD - 0.90; 95% CI, - 1.16, - 0.63; P &lt; 0.001), hirsutism (SMD - 0.58; 95% CI, - 1.01, - 0.16; P &lt; 0.001), and total testosterone levels (SMD - 0.58; 95% CI, - 0.82, - 0.34; P &lt; 0.001), and also increased the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (SMD 0.41; 95% CI, 0.11, 0.70; P &lt; 0.01), nitric oxide (NO) (SMD 0.33; 95% CI 0.08, 0.59; P = 0.01), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (SMD 0.64; 95% CI, 0.38, 0.90; P &lt; 0.001), glutathione (GSH) (SMD 0.26; 95% CI, 0.01, 0.52; P = 0.04), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels (SMD 0.46; 95% CI, 0.08, 0.85; P = 0.01). <strong>Probiotic supplementation may result in an improvement in weight, BMI, FPG, insulin, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, VLDL-cholesterol, CRP, MDA, hirsutism, total testosterone, QUICKI, NO, TAC, GSH, and SHBG but did not affect dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels, and total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol levels in patients with PCOS.</strong></p>

<p>I suppose I was more surprised that benefits were found across such a wide range of probiotics when it was my (limited) understanding that most probiotics are junk.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m not good with numbers, so how big a difference each intervention made, as seen in table 2, isn&#39;t clear to me. </p>

<p>If each intervention had significant benefits you could draw a variety of different hypotheses, such as these interventions are disrupting pathogens that are the cause of the PCOS. Diet isn&#39;t mentioned either, so maybe the patients&#39; diets were poor, resulting in dysbiosis, which these interventions partially disrupted or suppressed problematic microbes that were being fed by the poor diet. Not too sure. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not necessarily that &quot;most probiotics are junk&quot;, but rather, they&#39;re not ideal (compared to the microbes in breast milk or FMT) and seem to have similar mechanisms which aren&#39;t universally helpful, but in this case seemed to be more beneficial than not.

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing a lot of study on insulin resistance recently, and I thought it would be interesting to have a discussion about various aspects of insulin resistance. The aspects I&#39;ve thought of are:</p>

<ul>
<li>How is insulin resistance determined?</li>
<li>What is mechanistically going on in insulin resistance?</li>
<li>What is the cause of that behavior?</li>
<li>How is it best treated?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are likely other interesting parts to discuss...</p>

<p>My plan is to do a short post that summarizes *my* understanding of an area, and then others can comment on whether that agrees with their understanding.</p>

<p>****</p>

<p><strong>How is insulin resistance determined?</strong></p>

<p>Elevated <strong>Fasting Blood Glucose</strong> was one common way of diagnosing insulin resistance; a normal fasting blood glucose is considered to be less than 100 mg/dl. If after fasting overnight you have an elevated fasting blood glucose, you very likely have insulin resistance and type II diabetes.</p>

<p>Because fasting blood glucose is after an overnight fast, it is not necessarily definitive enough; somebody could have elevated blood glucose for much of the day but normal blood glucose after the overnight fast. There are two other measurements that are considered to be better.</p>

<p>The first is a blood measurement known as <strong>HbA1c</strong>. In simple terms, the hemoglobin in red blood cells is modified by glucose molecules (&quot;glycated&quot;), and the amount that this happens depends on the concentration of glucose in the blood. HbA1c is therefore a rough measure of the average glucose levels in the blood over the life of red blood cells, approximately 8-12 weeks. HbA1c is a pretty good measure overall but in some cases it can give a false negative - it may return a normal result for a patient who is actually insulin resistant. </p>

<p>The second measurement is the <strong>Oral Glucose Tolerance Test</strong> (<strong>OGT</strong> or <strong>OGTT</strong>). In this test, the patient is given 75 grams of glucose after an overnight fast and their blood glucose levels are measured every 20 or 30 minutes for a period of a few hours. Generally speaking, normal patients see a small glucose spike that rapidly returns to normal while very insulin resistant patients see high blood glucose levels for hours. There&#39;s a decent overall guide <a href="https://laboratoryinfo.com/glucose-tolerance-test-gtt-principle-procedure-indications-interpretation/">here</a> that shows the different responses that are seen and explains more about the test.</p>

<p>OGTT is considered to be the gold standard for insulin resistance, but like blood glucose, it is looking at the response after a fast when a person is best equipped to deal with a big chunk of dietary glucose. There have been some recent studies using continuous glucose monitoring on &quot;normal&quot; patients which found large blood glucose spikes - into the diabetic range - after meals.</p>

<p>It is fair to say that there is a wide spectrum of insulin resistance; there are people who are very diabetic and very insulin resistant, and those who are only slightly insulin resistant.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Like most metabolic processes in our bodies, there isn&#39;t a binary switch that signals insulin resistant versus not. People gradually lose their insulin sensitivity over decades until they start being symptomatic.</p>

<p>Relevant - the whole Virta not really &quot;reversing&quot; diabetes controversy boils down to whether or not their low-cab diet is useful in improving insulin sensitivity, or if it simply controls blood glucose levels. Those who oppose Virta&#39;s use of the term &quot;reversal&quot; argue that true reversal means an actual reversal of insulin resistance, not simply a reduction/stabilization of blood glucose levels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hyperinsulinemic syndrome: the metabolic syndrome is broader than you think.</strong></p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by hyperinsulinemia. In 2011 we showed that gastric bypass (RYGB) corrects these high levels even though insulin resistance remains high, ie, the operation &quot;dissociates&quot; hyperinsulinemia from insulin resistance. RYGB produces reversal of T2DM along with other diseases associated with the metabolic syndrome. This observation led us to examine whether these illnesses also were characterized by hyperinsulinemia.</p>

<p>METHODS:</p>

<p>A systematic review was performed to determine whether hyperinsulinemia was present in disorders associated with the metabolic syndrome. We reviewed 423 publications. 58 were selected because of appropriate documentation of insulin measurements. Comparisons were based on whether the studies reported patients as having increased versus normal insulin levels for each metabolic disorder.</p>

<p>RESULTS:</p>

<p>The presence (+) or absence (-) of hyperinsulinemia was documented in these articles as follows: central obesity (4+ vs 0-), diabetes (5+ vs 0-), hypertension (9+ vs 1-), dyslipidemia (2+ vs 0-), renal failure (4+ vs 0-), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (5+ vs 0-), polycystic ovary syndrome (7+ vs 1-), sleep apnea (7+ vs 0-), certain cancers (4+ vs 1-), atherosclerosis (4+ vs 0-), and cardiovascular disease (8+ vs 0-). Four articles examined insulin levels in the metabolic syndrome as a whole (4+ vs 0-).</p>

<p>CONCLUSION:</p>

<p>These data document that disorders linked to the metabolic syndrome are associated with high levels of insulin, suggesting that these diseases share a common etiology that is expressed by high levels of insulin. This leads us to propose the concept of a &quot;hyperinsulinemic syndrome&quot; and question the safety of insulin as a chronic therapy for patients with T2DM.</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>I was hoping this was going to be a discussion on insulin sensitivity.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>For testing, I think most people who get their fasting glucose measured (standard with a CMP) should also get a fasting insulin assay done (its a $30 test, but it&#39;s rarely given) as it will reveal developing insulin resistance much earlier than FBG or A1c alone will. You also can&#39;t calculate HOMA-IR(2) or QUICKI insulin resistance estimates without it!</p>

<p>One of the reasons A1c isn&#39;t always accurate btw is because it&#39;s dependent on RBC turnover. Fructosamine is a good test to use in the cases where you&#39;re getting discordant A1c&#39;s.</p>

<p>LP-IR (generated via lipid subfractionation, like with an NMR) is also a good estimator, although the single best/easiest marker for metabolic health is probably waist circumference ratio.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is it best treated? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as i know it&#39;s basically done by lowering body&#39;s exposure to insulin. Changing the diet so you eat foods that don&#39;t spike insulin, exercising and fasting.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting point; I&#39;m planning on touching on it in the post 4 about treatment.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>T2D is a disease of hyperinsulinemia as much as insulin resistance.</p>

<p>Low-carb/ketosis and fasting (exercise to some degree) will reverse hyperinsulinemia and as such are valid treatments.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m a little put off by your comment of &quot;simply controls blood glucose levels&quot; since BG levels are responsible for the damage of T2D.  Feels a little dismissive of limb loss, kidney damage, vision loss, etc.  Controlling BG is a huge benefit of ketogenic diets.  Fasting (which is ketogenic and restricts carbs during the fast) also helps restore BG levels by reducing insulin.</p>

<p>The issue with defining remission of T2D as lack of insulin resistance is that in ketosis, one is physiologically glucose sparing. Using FBG and insulin levels seems more useful in that context. </p>

<p>I guess it depends on the goal here in terms of the patient&#39;s health.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Insulin sensitivity is the inverse of insulin resistance; if you are are not insulin resistant, you are insulin sensitive.</p>

<p>Is there something you specifically want to know or discuss?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks - good info.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>This makes sense at a glance, but hasn&#39;t proven out in practice. Low-carb diets, for example, work wonderfully to control glucose and reduce insulin exposure but don&#39;t do much to improve actual insulin sensitivity.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What I learned from reading this article that I found interesting is that glucagon doesn&#39;t stimulate lipolysis in humans. That&#39;s a common misnomer in the keto community.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Hyperinsulinemia driven by insulin resistance. Meaning if the latter improves, so will the former. The inverse can&#39;t be said though, which is the gist of the controversy. Symptoms vs causes.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t mean to dismiss control of blood glucose. I believe it&#39;s always prudent to target that as an initial step in treating T2D.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious how different mechanisms work to improve it, in athletes, how it aids in glycogen restoration, or other situations. It&#39;s a concept I only just learned exists, so I&#39;ve been reading and bookmarking over the last few days.  </p>

<p>Nothing specific I suppose, it&#39;s just a very interesting concept.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Two major large scale studies looking at simple control of BG with more insulin/T2D drugs increases all cause mortality.  High BG response to glucose and high FBS are the symptom not the cause.</p>

<p>You can resolve hyperinsulinemia with ketosis or fasting.  This resolves BG issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Hmm. I wrote this a while back as part of a series for my cycling friends; it has some background on glucose storage and blood glucose regulation that&#39;s important...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.riderx.info/the-endurance-athletes-guide-to-fueling-and-weight-loss-part-1-fat-and-carbohydrate-intake-and-storage/">http://www.riderx.info/the-endurance-athletes-guide-to-fueling-and-weight-loss-part-1-fat-and-carbohydrate-intake-and-storage/</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>No disagreements there. The controversy is more around hyperinsulinemia/hyperglycemia vs insulin resistance (root cause) and whether or not one can claim they reversed diabetes if the root cause hasn&#39;t been addressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I see.  Even metabolically healthy people go into physiological glucose sparing when in ketosis and then return to normal insulin sensitivity when returning to consuming carbs.</p>

<p>So then, how can you tell if a T2D would return to normal insulin sensitivity (that they had before being T2D), after ketosis normalizes their T2D symptoms but they are in the same physiological glucose sparing as a healthy person would be?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s been shown if you break your metabolism, it can recover.  Remission (vs progressive/degenerative/there go your feet) might be the best we can do.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>There was a metabolic ward study posted here recently where subjects with diabetes were able to reduce (some even discontinue) their insulin dosage and improve glycemic control all while eating a diet very high in fiber, carbs, and low in fat. That implies an improvement in insulin sensitivity, since they were eating a large amount of carbohydrates while improving.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yes, a whole foods diet high in whole carbohydrate had some positive effect for T2D (You might have recalled this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bu8lz0/highcarbohydrate_highfiber_diets_for/">old study posted recently</a>.    They were lean, which is notable, and also &quot;The average </p>

<p>insulin dose was reduced from 26 ± 3 units/day (mean ± SEM) on the control diets to 11 ± 3 (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.001) on the HCF diets.</p>

<p>[Noted elsewhere &quot;On the HCF diets, insulin therapy could be discontinued in nine patients  receiving 15 to 20 units/day and in two patients receiving 32  units/day.&quot;]</p>

<p>Fasting and 3-hr postprandial plasma glucose values were lower in <strong>most</strong>  patients on the HCF diets than on the control diets despite lower  insulin doses.  [Fasting glucose never got below 100 -- this includes subjects where insulin was discontinued.]</p>

<p>Serum cholesterol values dropped from 206 ± 10 mg/dl on  the control diets to 147 ± 5 (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.001) on the HCF diet; </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>There have been recent papers looking at a whole foods high carb diet (&quot;WFPB&quot;) for T2D (where people were obese, as just about everyone with T2D is). I think there was one more recent than this but the results were similar.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16873779">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16873779</a></p>

<p>&quot;Forty-three percent (21 of 49) of the vegan group and 26% (13 of 50) of  the ADA group participants reduced diabetes medications. </p>

<p>Including all  participants, HbA(1c) (A1C) decreased 0.96 percentage points in the  vegan group and 0.56 points in the ADA group (P = 0.089). </p>

<p>[From elsewhere -- In a 12-week pilot trial of a low-fat vegan diet in individuals with  type 2 diabetes, conducted without increased exercise, fasting serum  glucose concentration dropped 28%] &quot;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Weight loss is a confounder in both of the more current studies, since in the one from 1975 all subjects were lean.</p>

<p>Ketosis has showed the best reduction so far in HbA1c and fasting blood glucose.</p>

<p>tl;dr yes, whole food high carb/low fat diets do show improvements in markers associated with insulin sensitivity.  The patients would have improved far more, on average, in ketosis, regardless of any physiological glucose sparing as part of being in ketosis.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The thing about reducing insulin on ketogenic diets is that it&#39;s expected, since they&#39;re eating a very low carb diet. Specially after one year on a VLCD. If you&#39;re barely eating carbs, it&#39;s no surprise you won&#39;t be spiking your glucose all the time. This still isn&#39;t saying much about insulin resistance (the root cause of T2D, hyperinsulinemia/glycemia, etc), hence the controversy surrounding Virta and their claim of diabetes reversal, rather than &quot;control&quot; or &quot;management.&quot; Not to mention the weight loss confounder.</p>

<p>The study I talk about isn&#39;t even WFPB if I recall correctly. Just high carb, high fiber, low fat. Notable differences are the stable weight and the improvement in glycemic control <em>while eating lots of carbs</em>. That&#39;s the interesting bit that might hint at actual insulin resistance reversal. Moreover it was only 16 days. More data is definitely needed to make any conclusions, but existing data seems to show that diets high in carbs and very low in fats show promise at actually reversing insulin resistance.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Ok but again that study the men were <em>lean</em> and had T2D so it wasn&#39;t related to visceral fat etc.  I don&#39;t think it is applicable to the current T2D situation.  Some did reduce insulin but their FBG was still all 100+ and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s ideal.</p>

<p>As the results with a high whole foods carb, low fat diet has only moderate effects, and a very small reduction in HbA1c, I don&#39;t see it as helpful for reversing insulin resistance or helping the patient avoid complications of their still high BG and still high HbA1c.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>They are very careful to use remission, which is accurate.  The patients have the best results in terms of eliminating insulin use, <em>lowering insulin levels in the body</em> and HbA1c.  In terms of clinical outcomes, it&#39;s better.</p>

<p>I see your point they are tolerating whole food carbohydrates on a LFH(W)C diet.  Before though they weren&#39;t eating whole food carbohydrates though, they were eating bread and pasta and soda and chips and crap.  So just eating better definitely helps, but it doesn&#39;t help as much as going into ketosis.</p>

<p>What we need to see is if after 2 years of ketosis, no T2D medication, all normal biomarkers, if those people can then consume a whole foods diet (that includes fat and animal products) and see no return of insulin resistance.  Until that study is done, the best clinical outcomes once someone eats themselves into T2D is going to be LCHF, regardless of if the patient has the same base insulin resistance they had while T2D.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Well the study was only 16 days, so I don&#39;t think we can conclude whether or not that diet is effective just yet. The way I see it, an improvement in glucose control (yes, still high, but c&#39;mon just 16 days <em>and</em>  still eating carbs) while eating a diet composed of 70% carbs is quite promising and hints at the possibility of insulin resistance reversal.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Current studies looking at a similar diet with obese T2D don&#39;t see that result.  70% carbs is largely whole foods, tons of fiber.  I think that&#39;s why insulin does lower and you see a minimal improvement in BG (which again remained over 100 as FBG, I don&#39;t know what the ranges accepted were in the 70s but that seemed high to me).</p>

<p>I find it neat that a low-fat diet like that results in the body scavenging fat from the liver and other visceral fat but a high fat diet also results in the body catabolizing that fat!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>For such a short study, rather than critique the FBG after 16 days, it makes more sense to see the direction the subjects were going in, improvement in glucose control + insulin reduction + all while eating lots of carbs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware LCHF diets are excellent at controlling hyperglycemia from the get-go, that&#39;s definitely a strength they have. What hasn&#39;t been shown is whether or not they&#39;re effective at improving insulin resistance.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Again those men were lean with T2D which is unusual and almost everyone with T2D nowadays is overweight or obese.  There have been far more current studies looking at a low-fat/high-carb diet, some for as long as a year.
There are some improvements in BG and in HbA1c but they are very small changes.  They didn&#39;t look at that metric back in the 70s so we don&#39;t know if there was improvement.</p>

<p>There needs to be a test for insulin resistance that can take into account physiological glucose sparing, and I think those sorts of studies won&#39;t happen until we have a large enough group of people who had T2D and put it into remission, where we can look at their response to switching to a low-fat/whole food high carb diet for 6 weeks or something.</p>

<p>Basically I expect anyone metabolically normal to handle a HWCLF diet just fine, in terms of FBG, etc.  Also anyone metabolically normal who goes into ketosis, can transition out of it to a HWHLF diet.</p>

<p>I stick that W in because a high refined carb diet is how people get T2D!</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Edit: Should be &quot;part 2&quot;...</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bz2puc/discussion_insulin_resistance_part_1_how_is/">Part 1: How is insulin resistance determined?</a></p>

<p>To understand what is going wrong mechanistically with insulin resistance, we need to understand how blood glucose regulation works. The following is a very brief overview and is of course simplified because biochemistry is very complex.</p>

<p><strong>Blood glucose regulation</strong></p>

<p>The pancreas is in charge of tracking blood glucose levels and keeping them regulated, and it does this through two messenger hormones; insulin and glucagon. In simple terms, insulin is the signal that there is too much glucose and glucagon is the signal that there is not enough glucose.</p>

<p>If blood glucose is <strong>low</strong>, the glucagon has two effects.</p>

<ul>
<li>It moves the body towards burning more fat and fewer carbs (because carbs are rare).</li>
<li>It messages the liver to release glucose to bring the blood glucose back to normal. The liver has two ways of doing this; it can convert stored glycogen back to glucose (glycogenolysis) or it can create glucose from compounds such as lactate, glycerol, or most animo acids (gluconeogenesis). It starts mostly using stored glycogen and transitions to mostly creating glucose as time goes on. Here&#39;s a <a href="http://fblt.cz/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Kapitola-09-07-ENG-03.jpg">nice chart</a> that shows timing.</li>
</ul>

<p>The liver is solely in charge of increasing glucose. That will be important later.</p>

<p>If blood glucose is <strong>high</strong>, the insulin has wider-ranging effects:</p>

<ul>
<li>It moves the body toward burning carbs and not fat.</li>
<li>It messages the muscles to take up extra glucose and store it as glycogen (this is limited by the glycogen storage capacity of the muscles)</li>
<li>It messages the liver to take up extra glucose and store it as glycogen (also limited by the glycogen storage capacity of the liver).</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are what I call the first-level effects; they happen with small amounts of insulin and the conversion of glucose to glycogen (glycogenesis) is quick, so it can absorb glucose quickly.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s not enough room for the glucose to be stored as glycogen, more insulin is secreted and we see what I call the second-level effects:</p>

<ul>
<li>The liver takes in glucose and converts it to fat.</li>
<li>The fat tissues takes in glucose and converts it to fat.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is known as &quot;de novo lipogenesis&quot; (&quot;new fat creation&quot;). It&#39;s fairly slow, so blood glucose will be elevated for a longer period of time in this scenario.</p>

<p><strong>Insulin Resistance mechanisms</strong></p>

<p>To recap from post 1, in insulin resistance we see elevated blood glucose after fasting and very high blood glucose after drinking 75 grams of glucose. I&#39;d like to talk about those separately.</p>

<p>The mechanism for elevated blood glucose is especially interesting and - I think - not understood by many people. These people have significantly elevated blood glucose after a 12 hour fast. That&#39;s long after they are getting glucose from their last meal, so something is going on with their glucose regulation machinery; they were able to go from a very high level after eating to a level that is only moderately elevated, so their body has the ability to either store or burn off a fair bit of glucose.</p>

<p>But they now appear to be stuck. They can&#39;t get from 144 mg/dl of glucose down to 80 mg/dl.</p>

<p>It&#39;s useful to look at that in terms of absolute quantities. People have around 50 dl of blood in their bodies, so at 144 mg/dl that would be 144 * 50 = 7200 mg = 7 grams of glucose. 80 mg/dl is 80 * 50 = 4000 mg = 4 grams of glucose. So the excess is a measly three grams of glucose. It would seem that they should easily be able to store or burn off that much glucose...</p>

<p>And they could. Which means that the problem is not related to glucose removal, it&#39;s related to glucose supply.</p>

<p>Remembering back to who is responsible for increasing blood glucose when it&#39;s low, the finger points directly at the liver. The reason that insulin resistant people have elevated fasting glucose is because their liver is not correctly responding to the insulin in the blood that would normally keep the liver from releasing glucose; the liver is releasing glucose <strong>all the time</strong>. And that constant stream of glucose means a constant stream of insulin, or hyperinsulinemia.</p>

<p>This excess glucose could either come from stored glycogen or gluconeogenesis. I think the research points much more strongly at gluconeogenesis being the problem. That makes more sense mechanistically as gluconeogenesis is the only non-dietary way to bring new glucose into the bloodstream.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the first malfunction in insulin resistance, and is often overlooked. The second discussion is the response after a &quot;glucose challenge&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read a bunch of the research about the lack of response to elevated glucose, and from my perspective there is not a consensus around what is going on, but a few things seem likely:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is well established that the size of the blood glucose and insulin response you see in people depends on the state of their glycogen stores. Feed an insulin sensitive person 75 grams of glucose after an overnight fast, and most of that is going to go straight into their glycogen stores. Take that same person and give them another 75 grams of glucose a few hours later, and the blood glucose and insulin response will be very different as their glycogen stores will be full. Given that insulin resistant people have excess glucose all the time, it is likely that their glycogen stores are full even when fasted and that is one of the reason their response is so poor. I haven&#39;t found any research on this, and would love to see any that exists.</li>
<li>There is something that is slowing down the uptake of glucose from the blood into the adipose cells (and perhaps muscle cells as well), and that also contributes to how long the blood glucose is elevated.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next post will be about the cause of both of these mechanistic malfunctions.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a super interesting observation.</p>

<p>From your other comments, the persistence of dawn phenomena in both keto and fasting would agree with the view that liver disregulation of GNG is a factor.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Sanpaku this is a great post with lots of sources. Definitely opened my eyes..what is the optimal diet for reducing insulin resistance?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Your major studies rely on overweight individuals, eating a SAD, who are over fed a certain type of fat.</p>

<p>This is not keto, this is not carnivore, that is abuse and mixing two different fuel sources together that shouldn&#39;t be mixed in the first place.</p>

<p>Your information is pushing for poor results, if you had studies proving SFA was bad while in the FULL ABSENCE OF CARBS I would be very inclined to believe you but it isn&#39;t so I&#39;m not.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I would be very surprised if it had not improved.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>One more comment on this. </p>

<p>Her markers on IR will probably be much better. If you take somebody on a carnivore or other VLC diet and give them an OGTT test, they will fail. This isn&#39;t because they are still insulin resistant; it&#39;s because their pancreas is in hibernation and cannot produce the amount of insulin required to deal with a big chunk of carbs. </p>

<p>OGTT test instructions typically recommend that the person eat a &quot;normal&quot; amount of carbs (not sure what that really means, but it means enough to require a decent amount of insulin) for a few days before the test.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>How is the doctor planning to evaluate her insulin resistance?</p>

<p>Congrats to her on the weight loss!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Just be aware that carnivore diet is not necessarily ketogenic; so people can overeat on protein (in relation to fat) leading to excess protein being converted to glucose for energy. <a href="/r/PaleolithicKetogenic">r/PaleolithicKetogenic</a> is basically the ketogenic subset of the carnivore diet.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Feed an insulin sensitive person 75 grams of glucose after an  overnight fast, and most of that is going to go straight into their  glycogen stores.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if I have been doing a high-fat ketogenic diet in place of an overnight fast? Where would the ingested glucose go?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Probably a diet that in total calories is hypocaloric (weight loss always improves insulin resistance) with macronutrients very low in saturated fat, low or &quot;incomplete&quot; in protein (fibroblast growth factor-21 responds to protein inadequacies and improves insulin sensitivity). The bulk of calories should come from low glycemic index starches and/or unsaturated fats. Fermentable fiber would help on the microbiome/inflammation side. There&#39;s a 85 year history of insulin resistance and early stage T2 diabetes being successfully treated with this sort of diet.</p>

<p>There is an appeal to the other end of the macronutrient balance. We all like high-fat/high-protein foods, so it doesn&#39;t take much rationalization justify these. High protein is useful for reducing appetite, and the absence of carbs will reduce measures like  HbA1c. However, absent weight loss, insulin resistance remains high, and all the lipotoxic ER stress is still occurring in pancreatic beta cells. Seems a good way to turn oneself into an asymptomatic diabetic.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>This will be a very interesting part of the discussion that I&#39;m hoping will happen on the next post after</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>How about this one? Even just changing the type of fat changes a person’s insulin sensitivity:

</div>
<div class="md"><p>Likely straight into glycogen storage in the liver/muscle as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>If you&#39;ve been doing it consistently, it probably won&#39;t go anywhere as the pancreas will reduce its ability to generate insulin if it isn&#39;t needed for an extended period of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What your top ten articles or methods for reducing insulin resistance if I may ask?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Seems like your own the other guys boat too. </p>

<p>This is not a study with the absence of carbs, this looks to be a non ketogenic study.</p>

<p>I never argued SFA with carbs was bad, I argued these studies are worthless because they look into insulin resistance with a MODERATE CARB HIGH FAT DIET, 2 energy sources that don&#39;t mix well. We need low carb diet studies that show similar results.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thats with a 47% carbohydrate diet. </p>

<p>Shes doing close to 0% carbohydrates. My understanding is that the insulin effect of protein in strongly dependent of amount of carbohydrates consumed (without carbs its close to zero). See Professor Bikmans take on it:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3fO5aTD6JU">Dr. Benjamin Bikman - &#39;Insulin vs. Glucagon: The relevance of dietary protein&#39;</a></p>

<p>also its possible to do a carnivore diet with a range of different protein:fat ratios. Not everyone is doing a high protein.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Ok then what aout this one?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15070924">Differential metabolic effects of saturated versus polyunsaturated fats in ketogenic diets.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ketogenic diets (KDs) are used for treatment of refractory epilepsy and metabolic disorders. The classic saturated fatty acid-enriched (SAT) KD has a fat:carbohydrate plus protein ratio of 4:1, in which the predominant fats are saturated. We hypothesized that a polyunsaturated fat-enriched (POLY) KD would induce a similar degree of ketosis with less detrimental effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Twenty healthy adults were randomized to two different weight-maintaining KDs for 5 d. Diets were 70% fat, 15% carbohydrate, and 15% protein. The fat contents were 60 or 15% saturated, 15 or 60% polyunsaturated, and 25% monounsaturated for SAT and POLY, respectively. Changes in serum beta-hydroxybutyrate, insulin sensitivity (S(I)), and lipid profiles were measured. Mean circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate levels increased 8.4 mg/dl in the POLY group (P = 0.0004), compared with 3.1 mg/dl in the SAT group (P = 0.07). <strong>S(I) increased significantly in the POLY group (P = 0.02)</strong>, whereas total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly in the SAT group (both P = 0.002). <strong>These data demonstrate that a short-term POLY KD induces a greater level of ketosis and improves S(I)</strong>, without adversely affecting total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared with a traditional SAT KD. Thus, a POLY KD may be superior to a classical SAT KD for chronic administration.</p>

<div class="md"><p>70% fat, 15% carbohydrate, and 15% protein</p>

<p>This is STILL not a ketogenic diet, you seem to be misinformed of what a ketogenic diet truly is. </p>

<p>It needs to be less than 10% of your total carbs at 4:1, not 15. The whole &quot;keep it under 20 net carbs&quot; varies between people, but the rule of thumb is usually 10-5%, and the more restrictive the carb intake the greater the beneficial effects. </p>

<p>Not only that &quot;a <strong>short-term</strong> POLY KD induces a greater level of ketosis and improves S(I), without adversely affecting total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared with a traditional SAT KD.&quot;, short term means nothing for the majority of people who take this as a permanent life style change. It&#39;s also generally accepted that to become genuinely fat adapted, one needs about half a year.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Overall average consumption of sugar sweetened beverages has declined, but obesity and metabolic syndrome has not.  It seems that the simple average over a whole population isn&#39;t telling the most useful story. If 50% of the people drink 100% of the SSB and most of them get sick, the issue is still added refined sugars (mostly fructose fro HFCS).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213560/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213560/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Energy intake was significantly increased across SSB consumption in both men and women (<em>p</em> = 0.0038 and 0.0082, respectively). SSB consumption was positively associated with carbohydrate intake in men and women (<em>p</em> = 0.0021 and 0.0424, respectively) and with fat intake in men (<em>p</em>  = 0.0058). The percentage of energy from protein and fat significantly  increased across SSB consumption levels in men and women (all <em>p</em>  &lt; 0.0001), whereas the percentage of energy from carbohydrate was  negatively associated with SSB consumption in men and women (all <em>p</em> &lt; 0.0001)&quot;</p>

<p>Don&#39;t drink your calories, kids, you&#39;ll then consume more total.</p>

<p>&quot;The main findings of the present study indicate that SSB consumption is  closely linked to an increased risk of obesity in both men and women  after adjustment for potential confounders using data from  representative Korean adults. SSB consumption was positively associated  with the prevalence of MetS and its individual components including  abdominal obesity, reduced HDL-C, and elevated fasting glucose among the  Korean population.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a correlation, based on self-reported food questionaires, but then again so is the work showing an overall average decline.  It still seems like these drinks are driving diabesity and it&#39;s that the groups still drinking them, while fewer and thus driving down the overall average, are at higher risk of MetS.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The obesity and related health problems will only get worse until we educated people on the dangers of added sugar, and regulate it somehow. It will be a very long and difficult process, even harder than it was to finally convince people smoking is bad, which still hasn&#39;t stopped many people. The world&#39;s health is turning to crap and only getting worse, I&#39;m just so glad I took an interest in health and nutrition and now know better.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Dangers of overeating more so than added sugar. </p>

<p>But that will require people getting vitally interested in finding out what makes them overeat in the first place. Hint: it is not food composition.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I agree overeating is a huge aspect in our society but there’s added sugar in literally everything... I feel like this drives obesity and insulin resistance </p>

<p>At the end of the day calories are calories; overeating veggies vs overeating fast food everyday both lead to increase in weight gain, but if it’s veggies you’re getting a lot more nutrients and other things whereas fast food leads straight to excess weight gain with little to none nutritional benefits </p>

<p>Sugar itself is highly addictive, and there’s studies out there showing that cutting out sugar lowered many metabolic diseases and heart disease risks</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Iodine, an essential micronutrient, is required to produce thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) comprise a range of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, with the most significant irreversible effect resulting from neurodevelopmental deficits in fetal brain caused by deficient iodine status during early pregnancy. The objective of this scoping review was to summarize the studies that assessed iodine status of women of reproductive age in the USA. A systematic review of literature using the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) statement was conducted. PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, EBSCOHost, Cochrane, ERIC, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases were searched, 1652 records were identified. One thousand six hundred forty-one records that did not satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality review were excluded, and 11 peer-reviewed articles were determined to be eligible for this scoping review. Despite the USA being considered iodine sufficient for the general population, the US dietary iodine intakes have decreased drastically since the 1970s, with iodine deficiency reemerging in vulnerable groups such as women of reproductive age. Although data to conduct a scoping review of iodine status among women of reproductive age in the USA was scarce, majority of the articles reviewed demonstrate emergent iodine deficiency in this population of women of reproductive age, indicating alarm for a public health concern needing immediate attention.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Background: <strong>Arterial aging is well characterized in industrial populations, but scantly described in populations with little access to modern medicine. Here we characterize health and aging among the Tsimane, Amazonian forager-horticulturalists with short life expectancy, high infectious loads and inflammation, but low adiposity and robust physical fitness. Inflammation has been implicated in all stages of arterial aging, atherogenesis and hypertension, and so we test whether greater inflammation associates with atherosclerosis and CVD risk. In contrast, moderate to vigorous daily activity, minimal obesity, and low fat intake predict minimal CVD risk among older Tsimane.</strong></p>

<p>Methods and Findings: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), based on the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI), and hypertension were measured in Tsimane adults, and compared with rates from industrialized populations. <strong>No cases of PAD were found among Tsimane and hypertension was comparatively low (prevalence: 3.5%, 40+; 23%, 70+). Markers of infection and inflammation were much higher among Tsimane than among U.S. adults, whereas HDL was substantially lower.</strong> Regression models examine associations of ABI and BP with biomarkers of energy balance and metabolism and of inflammation and infection. Among Tsimane, obesity, blood lipids, and disease history were not significantly associated with ABI. Unlike the Tsimane case, higher cholesterol, C-reactive protein, leukocytes, cigarette smoking and systolic pressure among North Americans are all significantly associated with lower ABI.</p>

<p>Conclusions: <strong>Inflammation may not always be a risk factor for arterial degeneration and CVD, but instead may be offset by other factors: healthy metabolism, active lifestyle, favorable body mass, lean diet, low blood lipids and cardiorespiratory health. Other possibilities, including genetic susceptibility and the role of helminth infections, are discussed. The absence of PAD and CVD among Tsimane parallels anecdotal reports from other small-scale subsistence populations and suggests that chronic vascular disease had little impact on adult mortality throughout most of human evolutionary history.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No conflicts were declared.</p>

<p>The discussion is quite long, but all relevant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We propose several possible hypotheses to explain the low atherosclerosis and CVD prevalence among Tsimane, and other traditional foraging and horticultural populations living under similar conditions. The combination of low LDL and high physical exertion is a common feature in many of these populations. The Tsimane diet contains wild game and fish, is low in saturated fat, and high in potassium (K). Plantains provide ∼1,500 mg K/day. Low BMI and LDL, and sparse tobacco consumption may be protective factors trumping the risk factors of atherosclerosis and CVD. Oxidized LDL is implicated in inflammatory cascades leading to endothelial dysfunction, plaque maturation and rupture; therefore some argue that atherosclerosis and CVD are avoidable when LDL is maintained &lt;70 mg/dL [15]. The Tsimane LDL profile is favorable though only 34% of Tsimane adults age 40+ have LDL below 70. Mean BP and ABI, however, do not differ among those above this LDL cutoff. With low HDL and moderate triglyceride levels, Tsimane have a healthy but “normal” mean total cholesterol to HDL ratio of 4.0 and an LDL to HDL ratio of 2.3 (for adults age 40+).</p>

<p>The physically demanding Tsimane lifestyle may be central for maintaining healthy metabolism and favorable body mass, blood lipids and cardiorespiratory health. Subsistence hunting, fishing and slash and burn farming require extensive daily physical activity, consistent with high VO2max values found using a variation of the Harvard Step Test on a subsample....These results are consistent with evidence for the cardioprotective value of exercise. Exercise reduces oxidative load in muscle, levels of inflammatory cytokines, SBP, macrophage-rich fat and improves insulin sensitivity [10]. Exercise associates with a favorable CVD risk profile independently of leanness [35]. Individuals with high cardio-fitness based on resting and maximal heart rate and VO2max show the lowest heart disease risk [36], [37]. </p>

<p>Several alternative explanations may also be responsible for the low CVD risk profile of Tsimane, and merit future investigation. Tsimane and other Amerindians should be comprehensively investigated for distinct inflammation profiles due to genetic variability in loci affecting expression of CRP [39], apolipoprotein-E [40], mannose-binding lectin (MBL) [41], NR4A nuclear receptor family [42], interleukine-6 (IL-6) [43], IL-1 [44], and toll-like receptor 4 [45]. These reflect the extent to which Tsimane exhibit pro- or anti-inflammatory preconditions. Amerindians also show distinct human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression at various MHC loci compared with other populations that show evidence of overdominant selection [46]. Although HLA-DR expression in macrophages and T-cells has been linked to plaque eruption and erosion [47], it is an open question whether allelic variation is of clinical significance. Other genetic contributions involve the processes by which inflammation and arterial damage result in acute coronary events. Plaque stability, disruption, erosion and thrombogenicity may be impacted by genes affecting interferon-α, collagen content and smooth muscle density in the fibrous cap [48], inflammatory infiltration of the cap, lipid composition of the atheromatous core and extracellular matrix (e.g. soft cholesterol esters vs. hard crystalline cholesterol), and both mechanical and hemodynamic forces that shear apart plaques. Genetic differences affecting metalloproteinase expression (e.g. collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins and matrilysin) may also be important, as these have been described as degrading all components of the extracellular matrix and can therefore also impact plaque disruption [49]. Genetics and diet (e.g. flavonol-rich citrus fruits) may also influence platelet aggregation, coagulation and fibrinolysis, which affects blood flow and thrombus formation at the site of disrupted plaques [50]. Genes affecting monocyte recruitment [e.g. CD14 receptor polymorphisms] [51], lipid transport [e.g., cholesteryl ester transport protein (CETP)] [52], lipid oxidation, and modulation of the inflammatory response to oxidized lipids may also help explain differences in susceptibility of populations to developing atherosclerosis [53].</p>

<p>One preliminary attempt to assess the implications of genetic differences between Tsimane and other populations is to consider atherosclerosis and CVD risk among Amerindians in the U.S. A study among 13 North Amerindian groups revealed a low rate of PAD (5.3%) among adults aged 45–74, little difference in PAD prevalence among the groups, and significant predictive effects of LDL, BMI, cigarette pack-years and fibrinogen [54]. Thus, while PAD is on the low end among North Amerindians, PAD is associated with the same risk factors as those in other populations. Most importantly, CRP levels among North Amerindians are higher than in other U.S. populations (median 3.2 mg/L even after removing the 16% who had CRP&gt;10 mg/L), and predict incident CVD [55]. Despite similar PAD rates and lower LDL levels than national averages, a longitudinal cohort study of CVD among North American Indians has shown that North Amerindians have higher rates of CVD than other U.S. populations, and that standard risk factors (e.g. hypertension, LDL, HDL, BMI) are predictive of CVD [56]. Their high rates of CRP and CVD are likely due to the high prevalence of diabetes, renal disease and obesity; hyperglycemia impedes endothelial function and produces glycation end products that support myocardial dysfunction [57].</p>

<p>Another unexplored potential explanation highlights the hypothesized cardioprotective effects of chronic helminthic infection. Polarized Th-2 immune activation associated with helminthic infection modifies cytokine profiles, whereby anti-inflammatory IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 protect vessel walls from oxidized LDL-induced monocyte injury in the endothelium, and downregulate fibrinogen synthesis [58]. Th-2 activation may also modulate responses to heat shock proteins, Chlamydia pneumonia, and cytomegalovirus, each of which has been tentatively linked to atherosclerosis [59]. Finally, helminthes may modulate host lipid metabolism, and may be responsible for lower blood cholesterol levels in parasitized humans [60]. Indeed, total and HDL cholesterol varied inversely with several infectious markers such as sedimentation rate, IgE and eosinophil count among Tsimane adults [61].</p>

<p>Background—Conventional coronary artery disease risk factors might potentially explain at
least 90% of the attributable risk of coronary artery disease. To better understand the association
between the pre-industrial lifestyle and low prevalence of coronary artery disease risk factors, <strong>we
examined the Tsimane, a Bolivian population living a subsistence lifestyle of hunting, gathering,
fishing, and farming with few cardiovascular risk factors, but high infectious inflammatory burden.</strong></p>

<p>Methods—We did a cross-sectional cohort study including all individuals who self-identified as
Tsimane and who were aged 40 years or older. <strong>Coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by coronary
artery calcium (CAC) scoring done with non-contrast CT in Tsimane adults. We assessed the
difference between the Tsimane and 6814 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis (MESA). CAC scores higher than 100 were considered representative of
significant atherosclerotic disease.</strong> Tsimane blood lipid and inflammatory biomarkers were
obtained at the time of scanning, and in some patients, longitudinally.</p>

<p>Findings—Between July 2, 2014, and Sept 10, 2015, 705 individuals, who had data available for
analysis, were included in this study. <strong>596 (85%) of 705 Tsimane had no CAC, 89 (13%) had CAC
scores of 1–100, and 20 (3%) had CAC scores higher than 100. For individuals older than age 75
years, 31 (65%) Tsimane presented with a CAC score of 0, and only four (8%) had CAC scores of
100 or more, a five-fold lower prevalence than industrialised populations (p≤0-0001 for all age
categories of MESA). Mean LDL and HDL cholesterol concentrations were 2.35 mmol/L (91
mg/dL) and 1.0 mmol/L (39.5 mg/dL), respectively; obesity, hypertension, high blood sugar, and
regular cigarette smoking were rare. High- sensitivity C-reactive protein was elevated beyond the
clinical cutoff of 3.0 mg/dL in 360 (51%) Tsimane participants.</strong></p>

<p>Interpretation—<strong>Despite a high infectious inflammatory burden, the Tsimane, a forager-horticulturalist population of the Bolivian Amazon with few coronary artery disease risk factors,
have the lowest reported levels of coronary artery disease of any population recorded to date.
These findings suggest that coronary atherosclerosis can be avoided in most people by achieving a
lifetime with very low LDL, low blood pressure, low glucose, normal body-mass index, no
smoking, and plenty of physical activity. The relative contributions of each are still to be
determined.</strong></p>

<p>From the discussion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The pathophysiological mechanisms by which the Tsimane seem to be protected against
CAC development are unknown. <strong>Numerous potential explanations exist, and might relate to
coronary artery disease risk factors, subsistence lifestyle, genetics, and inflammation or
immune regulation. Tsimane have low total and LDL cholesterol.</strong> From 2004 to 2011, the
mean LDL cholesterol was 1.84 mmol/L (SD 0.57; appendix). Since 2011, average LDL
cholesterol has increased by 0.16 mmol/L per year and now averages 2.35 mmol/L. This
change is coincident with the availability of small gasoline motors that preclude the need for
manual canoeing or rafting for river travel to the market town, San Borja, where
non-subsistence food can be obtained. Whether the increasing LDL-cholesterol
concentrations coincide with increasing CAC will require assessment in future studies. <strong>This
low prevalence and extent of CAC exists in the presence of low HDL, a known coronary
artery disease risk factor. In the Tsimane, the average HDL was 1.0 mmol/L. This finding
might highlight a differential weight to LDL versus HDL cholesterol for CAC formation or,
alternatively, might be explained by ratios of total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol to HDL
cholesterol that place Tsimane individuals in a low-risk category when using US-based
classifications. Lower HDL cholesterol might also contribute to a higher likelihood of
infections and inflammation.</strong></p>

<p>The potentially atheroprotective effect of low LDL or LDL-to-HDL ratio might be partly
augmented by the Tsimane lifestyle. The Tsimane live a traditional forager-horticultural
lifestyle, in huts of thatched roofs, typically in villages of roughly 60-200 people (figure 5).
<strong>An estimated 14% of their average caloric diet is protein, 14% is fat, and 72% is
carbohydrate. Meat protein and fat are acquired by hunting with guns and bow and arrow,
or fresh water fishing with arrows, hook and line, or nets. Non-processed carbohydrates are
grown in the form of rice, plantain, manioc, and corn via slash-and-burn horticulture, and the
Tsimane also gather wild nuts and fruits. Importantly, carbohydrates are high in fibre and
very low in saturated fat and simple sugars, which might further explain our study findings.
The Tsimane diet lacks trans fats, and is a low fat diet, with an average estimated daily
consumption of 38 g fat, with 11 g saturated fat, 14 g monounsaturated fat, and 8 g
polyunsaturated fat. Most of a typical Tsimane day involves the physical activity of
farming, hunting, food preparation, household chores, and parenting. The average hunt lasts
more than 8 h and covers nearly 18 km, while horticultural labour includes using metal axes
to chop large areas of primary forest. Men and women spend a mean of 6–7 h and 4–6 h per
day engaging in physical activity, respectively. Less than 10% of Tsimane daylight hours
are spent engaged in sedentary activity, while more than 54% of waking hours are sedentary
in industrial populations. The Tsimane lack access to clean water, sewerage, or
electricity; over two- thirds of adults suffer from intestinal helminths at any given time.</strong>
The low prevalence of coronary artery disease in the Tsimane extends indirect evidence
found in other populations that an active subsistence lifestyle is atheroprotective.</p>

<p>Yes, did you read <strong><em>this</em></strong> paper? an estimation based on a 705 individuals compared to the totall 15.000/90+ villages </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Tsimane are a semi-sedentary population of ~15,000 forager-horticulturalists living in the Bolivian Amazon. They inhabit 90+ villages ranging in size from 50–500 individuals.</strong> They cultivate plantains, rice, corn, and sweet manioc in small swiddens, and regularly fish and hunt. Traditional foods comprise &gt;90% of the calories in the diet, with the remainder purchased from market stores, or obtained from trade with merchants (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5191915/#R70">Martin et al. 2012</a>). Tsimane live in extended family clusters, where the majority of food and labor sharing occurs. Mortality has been traditionally high, with approximately 20% of children dying before age 5 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5191915/#R46">Gurven et al. 2007</a>). The Tsimane rarely use modern contraceptives and total fertility rate is high (9.1 births per woman; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5191915/#R72">McAllister et al. 2012</a>). The population growth rate is also high at 3.6% per year. Mean (SD) age of first birth for men and women is 22.8 (4.2), and 18.6 (2.9) years, respectively (ibid). </p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>Please make sure to keep your comment respectful and avoid attacking the person.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>That is a study of the cognitive performance of 919 Tsimane and the authors provide no reference for their &#39;semi-sedentary&#39; claim, wheras the paper I linked takes its sourcing from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23383262/">this paper</a> which actually used accelerometers and heart-rate data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Accelerometry combined with heart rate monitoring was compared to the factorial method and used for nighttime sampling. Tsimane men and women display 24 hr physical activity level (PAL) of 2.02-2.15 and 1.73-1.85, respectively. Little time was spent &quot;sedentary&quot;, whereas most activity was light to moderate, rather than vigorous. Activity peaks by the late twenties in men, and declines thereafter, but remains constant among women after the early teens. Neither BMI, fat free mass or body fat percentage are associated with PAR. There was no negative effect of modernization on physical activity.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Again. their estimation is based only from that small sample of 705 individuals which is probably just <strong>one</strong> of those 90+ villages and is nowhere near the entire Tsimane population of 15.000-16.000 or even more people.</p>

2019-07-02 15:18:38,900 - __main__ - DEBUG - Submission Full Text: 
"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bz2puc/discussion_insulin_resistance_part_1_how_is/">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bzgm2z/discussion_insulin_resistance_part_1_what_is/">Part 2</a> first....</p>

<p>At the end of the last part, we had reached the point where we had talked about two things going on in insulin resistance:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A break in the glucose regulation system that causes the liver to continuously release glucose even when blood glucose is elevated and there is insulin in the blood.  </p></li>
<li><p>A decrease in the glucose-absorption ability of body cells, primarily of muscle and fat cells.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And what is causing that?</p>

<p>Well, the cause for the first seems to be excess fat accumulation in the liver, and that has been implicated in the second, though there is less research there. </p>

<p>This accumulation of excess fat in the liver is known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and has been known since the 1950s. NALFD may progress into more serious diseases in some cases. </p>

<p>There are different opinions on whether NAFLD is the cause of insulin resistance or vice versa. For our purposes, it&#39;s sufficient just to know that they are very highly correlated. </p>

<p>So, we have too much fat in the liver. How could it get there?</p>

<p>There are three sources of new fat in the human body:</p>

<ol>
<li>From fat that we eat</li>
<li>From fat created by the liver, either from glucose pulled from the bloodstream, or from the metabolism of other compounds, such as fructose, galactose, or ethanol.</li>
<li>From fat created by the fat cells from glucose.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is also likely that the amount of fat being burnt is important as accumulation not only requires new fat, it requires more fat coming in than going out.</p>

<p>Here is where we get to the contentious part; there are two main theories as to what is going on here. I&#39;ll attempt to explain them both, but I clearly have a dog in this race and welcome others to expand on the position that I don&#39;t hold.</p>

<p>The first theory is that it comes from dietary fat; that if you eat too much dietary fat, that fat is absorbed by the liver and the accumulation causes the insulin resistance and NAFLD.</p>

<p>The second theory is that it comes from fat that is created from carbohydrates. Fructose metabolism is a common villain in this theory. </p>

<p>How can we determine which of these theories is more likely to be correct?</p>

<p>I like to look and see what the mechanistic story is for each of the theories and see if it makes sense from that perspective, and also look at what studies can tell us.</p>

<p>AFAIK, the mechanistic story for the first theory is that more fat in the diet means more fat in circulation and therefore more fat absorbed by the liver. </p>

<p>Luckily, we already have a measure of fat in circulation; it&#39;s the triglycerides level. If a higher-fat diet results in higher triglyceride readings, that would be good support for this theory.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the evidence is exactly the opposite; there is robust evidence that lower-carb/higher-fat diets result in low triglyceride levels. If we look at Gardner&#39;s <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/205916">ATOZ study</a>, table 3 shows us that not only did the lower-carb (Atkins) diet lead to significantly lower fasted triglyceride levels, the biggest difference was early on when the carb levels were the lowest. This is a common feature in pretty much all of the truly low carb diets tested; they all reduce triglycerides more than the higher carb variants.</p>

<p>The other bit of evidence is the lack of clinical effectiveness of low-fat diets in treating type II diabetes. The majority of them produce increases in insulin sensitivity, but the improvements are small and the majority of the participants are still quite diabetic at the end of the study.</p>

<p>I leave it to others to advance more support for this theory. </p>

<p>WRT the second theory - that it&#39;s created fat that is the problem - I think the picture there is clearer.</p>

<p>We know that it&#39;s possible to accumulate a lot of fat in the liver purely through liver metabolism because that is what happens with alcoholic fatty liver disease. The metabolism of ethanol in the liver leads to excess energy in the liver, which leads to the creation of fatty acids and triglycerides, which accumulates. Both fructose and galactose are also metabolized only in the liver, and because they typically come with glucose, the liver will be in a high energy state when they are metabolized, which will push the liver to create fat from the extra energy (the only other destination for the extra energy would be as glucose, but extra glucose is not desirable when glucose is already common).</p>

<p>The liver fat could also come from the high blood triglycerides that are common for those with insulin resistance. Or if could be a combination effect; if the liver is creating a lot of new triglycerides when the blood triglycerides are high, perhaps that inhibits the release of triglycerides from the liver (I did not find any research on this but would  love to see some).</p>

<p>We would also expect that people in this state would have trouble losing weight because the hyperinsulinemia would inhibit fat burning, and that is also what we see. </p>

<p>If this theory were correct, what sort of diet would work well for insulin resistance and type II diabetes?</p>

<p>First, it would reduce both the amount of fat that is created by the liver and the amount of fat in circulation. </p>

<p>Second, it would somehow deal with the defect in gluconeogenesis so that blood glucose was normalized. </p>

<p>Third, it would deal with the hyperinsulinemia that is blocking fat burning so that the extra fat - both in the bloodstream and in the liver - could be burned.</p>

<p>I see one way to enable this mechanistically - through significant carbohydrate reduction.</p>

<p>It would certainly reduce the amount of fat created by the liver; not only would there be less fructose or galactose to metabolize, there would be less glucose to put the bloodstream into a high-glucose state where fructose and galactose would be metabolized to fat. </p>

<p>It would deal with the broken regulation of gluconeogenesis by putting the body into a state where gluconeogenesis was desirable, thereby making the broken regulation irrelevant. </p>

<p>It would deal with hyperinsulinemia by creating a metabolic condition where insulin was rarely necessary.</p>

<p>Is there clinical evidence for this?</p>

<p>I know of three approaches with studies that have credibly shown *reversal* of type II diabetes and insulin resistance. </p>

<ol>
<li>Gastric bypass</li>
<li>Very low calorie diets (600-800 calories per day)</li>
<li>Keto diets</li>
</ol>

<p>Gastric bypass is really a very low calorie diet, enforced by surgery. In the very low calorie cases, the body necessarily has much less carbohydrate than a normal calorie variant; the body is in a state of semi-starvation, and that&#39;s exactly when gluconeogenesis and fat burning both ramp up.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Any study of a ketogenic diet without calorie restriction that worked to improve insulin resistance? It&#39;s really bothersome that most ketogenic studies are confounded by weight loss.  A-to-Z study was also confounded by weight loss. It&#39;s true that ketogenic diet will tend to lower trig more than high-carb diet, but we still don&#39;t know how well an eucaloric ketogenic diet would do. Has it been tested? </p>

<p>As I said in that comment, without energy restriction, a ketogenic diet won&#39;t be able to address hepatic fat content. A eucaloric diet won&#39;t necessitate emptying of the liver as all the energy will be provided by the food, and an hypercaloric ketogenic diet will results in elevated trig which will have to be store somewhere, and that will in part be in the liver. </p>

<p>I’ve never heard of this first theory. Many people  do think that insulin resistance is caused by excess calories, from any source, leading to excess body fat- especially hormonally active visceral fat and intromyocellular lipids. In a literal sense, most body fat is sourced from dietary fat, not de novo lipogenesis, but massive overeating of carbohydrate could do it too.</p>

<p>This goes with what you wrote at the end about large calorie deficits being the only treatment known to reverse insulin resistance. Because they cause rapid body fat loss. </p>

<p>I think you would need to address the finding that gastric bypass essentially reverses diabetes immediately after surgery.

<p>“Several intervention studies in diabetics and nondiabetics show fructose to markedly lower HbA1c (22–27)...</p>

<p>No evidence was uncovered via PubMed that &lt;100 g/d fructose in exchange for other carbohydrate would impair insulin sensitivity in humans. Indeed, consistent with a lowering of HbA1c (Fig. 1A), insulin sensitivity was improved (24) (Fig. 1 B). By contrast, an excessive intake (250 g/d) is reported to cause insulin resistance (28) (Fig. 2), and intermediate but still very high or excessive doses (&gt;100 g/d) can be without important effect (29,30). This provides weak evidence of possible dose dependency (Fig. 2) and strong reason to caution against extrapolating from excessive to moderate or high fructose intakes seen in the general population...</p>

<p>Meta-analysis of &gt;40 human intervention studies show &lt;100 g/d fructose is either without effect or may lower FPTG (Fig. 1 C) (10).

<p>I honestly feel that this is a bit of sour grapes, in that keto diets get penalized for being more effective at losing weight than other ones.

<p>I agree that in general if you are going to be burning off the hepatic fat - or any fat in general - you need to be in a negative energy balance. But the majority of keto studies are ad libitum and many people lose significant weight in that scenario.</p>

<p>I do think that triglyceride export from the liver is a factor, but I&#39;m skeptical - as I think Attia was - about it being useful as treatment.</p>

<p>The average insulin resistant person has significantly elevated triglycerides and is not effectively burning fat because of hyperinsulinemia. If you can improve the export of fat from the liver, it&#39;s going to either make the triglycerides worse or shift that fat burden to the fat cells. If that latter happens, that would be a better state, but one of the reasons the triglycerides are high is because the fat cells don&#39;t want that extra fat, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s obvious that the right thing happens.</p>

<p>I did find it interesting, however, that choline seems to be abundant in most keto diets and is likely lacking in many standard diabetes diets.</p>

<p>It is now clear that adipocytes function as endocrine glands with  wide-reaching effects on other organs including the brain. The release  of a wide variety of molecules including hormones such as leptin,  cytokines such as TNF-α, and substrates such as FFAs allows the adipose  organ to play a major regulatory role in energy balance and glucose  homeostasis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing they have in common is a focus on insulin resistance at the skeletal muscle cell and at the adipocyte. Maybe the first place you started being confusing was with the focus on fatty liver. </p>

<p>You also said &quot;How can we determine which of these theories is more likely to be correct?&quot; which kind of implied that everyone knows these are the only two options, and that one of them simply has to be the correct, root cause of insulin resistance; when in reality it seems much, much more complicated than that coming from the actual scientists.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I wasn&#39;t including keto diets because unlike the other two they have not been shown to reverse insulin resistance. Although, if keto can reverse it, it&#39;s through weight loss, which still involves a calorie deficit when the diet is ad libitum.</p>

<p>Here is an interesting review, although it only has 50 citations, so I wouldn&#39;t put much stock in their novel proposed mechanism: <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11684-013-0262-6">Mechanisms of insulin resistance in obesity</a> (<a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1007/s11684-013-0262-6">full text</a>). It summarizes several other proposed mechanisms including inflammation, lipotoxicity, hyperinsulinemia, and mitochondrial dysfunction. It does seem likely that more than one of these are causal for insulin resistance, and I think there is also a place for the effects of dietary lipids and sugar (like <a href="/u/sanpaku">u/sanpaku</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bzgm2z/discussion_insulin_resistance_part_1_what_is/eqsx2ch/?context=3">mentioned</a> yesterday). So I would say there are multiple important mechanisms if you consider that different causes act on different links in the chain of the biochemical pathway of insulin resistance.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yet in humans:</p>

<p><em>Saturated Fat Is More Metabolically Harmful for the Human Liver Than Unsaturated Fat or Simple Sugars.</em></p>

<p>“RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We overfed 38 overweight subjects (age 48 ± 2 years, BMI 31 ± 1 kg/m2, liver fat 4.7 ± 0.9%) 1,000 extra kcal/day of saturated (SAT) or unsaturated (UNSAT) fat or simple sugars (CARB) for 3 weeks. We measured IHTG (1H-MRS), pathways contributing to IHTG (lipolysis ([2H5]glycerol) and DNL (2H2O) basally and during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia), insulin resistance, endotoxemia, plasma ceramides, and adipose tissue gene expression at 0 and 3 weeks.</p>

<p>RESULTS: Overfeeding SAT increased IHTG more (+55%) than UNSAT (+15%, P &lt; 0.05). CARB increased IHTG (+33%) by stimulating DNL (+98%). SAT significantly increased while UNSAT decreased lipolysis. SAT induced insulin resistance and endotoxemia and significantly increased multiple plasma ceramides. The diets had distinct effects on adipose tissue gene expression.</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS: Macronutrient composition of excess energy influences pathways of IHTG: CARB increases DNL, while SAT increases and UNSAT decreases lipolysis. SAT induced the greatest increase in IHTG, insulin resistance, and harmful ceramides. Decreased intakes of SAT could be beneficial in reducing IHTG and the associated risk of diabetes.”</p>

<div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot we don&#39;t know yet but in the scenario I described, it looks like the incretin response plays a major role. There are all sorts of hypothesis and a variety of scenarios as to why the bypass works so quickly in reversing T2DM and they revolve around the glucoregulatory role of the gut. The fact that we see improved glucose responses prior to weight loss in patients after surgery indicates that it is not just a response to a low calorie diet.</p>

<p><a href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/39/6/893">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/39/6/893</a></p>

<p>I find the incretin based hypothesis interesting and plausible. By removing the upper portion of the small intestine you are introducing more nutrient rich food into lower parts of the GI tract. There are a greater density of nutrient sensing, incretin releasing cells further down the small intestine. Usually food would&#39;ve been absorbed further up the tract and not illicit as great of an incretin response. In certain surgeries that involve cutting out a portion of the upper small intestine, you now introduce a more nutritious slurry further down the GI tract. This interacts with the greater density of the incretin response cells and as a result, a greater incretin response. Some also propose that there is a dysfunction in incretin response that leads to insulin resistance and weight gain.</p>

<p>For a given diabetic at a given activity level, the muscles are going to burn a given amount of glucose. That is what defines how much glucose the muscles can absorb. They may in fact absorb it more slowly, but if they aren&#39;t absorbing enough to replenish glycogen stores, they would go into muscle glycogen depletion over time. </p>

<p>I do think it could affect blood glucose levels in an OGTT, but those same muscles have been in an elevated glucose and insulin environment overnight and it may be that their glycogen stores are essentially full. </p>

<p>(I went looking for muscle glycogen storage information in diabetics but didn&#39;t find anything).</p>

<p>As for adipocytes, I think the mechanism there is more interesting, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very fruitful from a treatment perspective. We have an effective way of improving the uptake of glucose by adipocytes - injectable insulin does that well. </p>

<p>But when we give that to type II diabetics, they get fatter and not really any healthier. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t just true for diabetics. This is true for all of us. We can store glycogen until our stores are full. If they are full, do we become insulin resistant? </p>

<p>Anyone who eats slightly more carbs in a meal than they can immediately burn off plus use to top off glycogen now has &quot;extra&quot; glucose. So what do healthy people do with it? If I eat a high carb diet, with three meals a day, in at least one meal I&#39;m taking in enough energy for 8+ hours of functioning. Yet high carb diets don&#39;t cause insulin resistance - in fact isocalorically, highest carbs cause the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16620266/">greatest</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/52/3/524/4650824">muscle</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/19079907/">insulin</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/67/5/951/2651863">sensitivity</a>.</p>

<p>So where does the glucose go? Insulin stimulates Fatty Acid Synthase - don&#39;t people call it the &quot;fat storage hormone&quot;? Muscle cells take in glucose and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15039461/">synthesize</a> it into triglycerides, and store it for later. This isn&#39;t a problem if you are of normal weight and healthy. In fact athletes <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4762133/">have a lot</a> of IMC lipids which they use during exercise. &quot;Slow twitch&quot; muscle fibers burn them preferentially. When you do low-intensity exercise that burns fat, this is the fat you are burning.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re healthy, your muscle cells can remain insulin sensitive even when glycogen is full because they can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/0802861">convert</a> glucose to fat. They can also uptake triglycerides and store them directly. If your calorie intake is weight maintaining, your fat stores (adipose tissue and IMC lipids) don&#39;t grow, but within a day you are constantly oxidizing fat molecules and making new ones. When you&#39;re diabetic, you&#39;ve maxed out your IMC lipids (and not only that, they&#39;ve started producing <a href="https://journals.lww.com/co-clinicalnutrition/Abstract/2010/07000/Muscle_insulin_resistance__assault_by_lipids,.7.aspx">damaging byproducts</a>) and your adipocytes, so they must become insulin resistant and glucose and FFAs build up in the blood.</p>

<p>Also, insulin resistance might be the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3478531/">cause</a> of fatty liver for the same reason. Muscle DNL has a purpose, but liver DNL can only go into liver fat or triglycerides. </p>

<p>Getting fatter is the healthy response here. If you can stuff more glucose and fatty acids into cells they aren&#39;t floating around poisoning you. Genetically lucky people can gain more fat before insulin resistance and diabetes set in. But if there isn&#39;t a reduction in total energy availability, you are just setting a new <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/105705">ceiling</a> for when cells become <a href="https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fj.09-133058">full</a>.</p>

<p>Obese people burn a ton of fat. If you are not losing or gaining weight, you are burning what you eat. If a person eats 40% fat, 45% carbs, 15% protein, they are burning both carbs and fat every day. What they need is to burn fat <em>on net</em> which is only possible via a calorie deficit.</p>

<p>WRT muscle energy storage, my point is that extent to which muscles can pull energy out of the system is directly correlated to how much energy they are expending. Whether the muscle tissues is insulin resistant or not does not change this. </p>

<p>&gt;&gt; But when we give that to type II diabetics, they get fatter and not really any healthier.</p>

<p>&gt; Getting fatter is the healthy response here. If you can stuff more glucose and fatty acids into cells they aren&#39;t floating around poisoning you. Genetically lucky people can gain more fat before insulin resistance and diabetes set in. But if there isn&#39;t a reduction in total energy availability, you are just setting a new <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/105705">ceiling</a> for when cells become <a href="https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fj.09-133058">full</a>.</p>

<p>I agree that people who put on fat instead of getting insulin resistant are healthier than those with insulin resistance. But the studies who have attempted to tightly control blood glucose for people with insulin resistance have been disappointing from a health standpoint.</p>

<p>&gt; If a person eats 40% fat, 45% carbs, 15% protein, they are burning both carbs and fat every day. What they need is to burn fat <em>on net</em> which is only possible via a calorie deficit.</p>

<p>If that were the answer, then the myriad low-fat diets that have been tried for type II diabetes would generally be successful, but  that just isn&#39;t true. As I noted, the performance of the traditional diets is why type II diabetes is considered to be a chronic disease.</p>

<p>I agree that if you are burning more fat than you are adding, you are very likely in a calorie deficit. But I think the lack of success on most of those diets is an indication that diets that generate deficits aren&#39;t sufficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I had one more thought here...</p>

<p>Would you be willing to write up a post the explains what you think the cause of insulin resistance is? I think that would give me (and others) a clearer picture than the discussion chain that we have...</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What relevance is there to 100% of the obese population <em>not eating 1000 EXTRA calories per day</em>? None whatsoever.</p>

<p>I have evidence that NAFLD can be reduced in an isocaloric diet in which refined sugars, particularly fructose is minimized [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5663253/">1</a>]. I have evidence that on an isocaloric HFLC or LFH(W)C diet NAFLD is reduced.</p>

<p>&quot;A small clinical trial of 18 patients used MRS to measure change in IHTG  following two weeks of either a calorie-restricted diet, or a  carbohydrate-restricted diet that was not calorie-restricted, and found  that patients in the carbohydrate-restricted arm exhibited a more  profound IHTG reduction, without any difference in overall weight loss,  compared to the calorie restricted arm [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679496/#R38">38**</a>].  A recent two-year multi-center trial that included over 300 patients  enrolled in a comprehensive lifestyle modification regimen observed  similar weight loss achieved by adherence to low-fat, versus  low-carbohydrate diets. The low-carbohydrate diet group exhibited  superior HDL cholesterol profiles [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679496/#R39">39**</a>].&quot;  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679496/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679496/</a></p>

<p>Your claim was that there were “two main theories”. The theory you were setting up as a main theory is clearly not. Yes, other mechanisms have more advocates, making them more “main”. </p>

<p>It’s not though. The total energy they pull and utilize over an entire day is dependent on expenditure. But muscles can store energy, so they can pull more postprandially if they are insulin sensitive. If you aren’t going to read my links I’ll stop citing papers. </p>

<p>Why does “treatment that cures diabetes” also have to be “magical treatment that makes it easy to lose weight”? Losing weight is seriously difficult. At the same time that excess energy is making you sick, other mechanisms in the body and brain are fighting back against any weight loss. It’s awful and deranged. </p>

<p>Low calorie diets work to reverse diabetes when the patients can stick to them (like in research studies). They are also incredibly difficult to stick to (in the real world). These things are not related. A diet that a patient can’t maintain is a failure, but not because it doesn’t “work”. Gastric bypass, like the other commenter mentioned, has an advantage because it actually <a href="http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2011/07/how-does-gastric-bypass-surgery-cause.html?m=1">lowers the set point</a>. So it seems to work the best of everything we know. </p>

<p>The idea that there must be one simple magical unified theory of everything for diabetes is a fallacy. There are thousands of biochemical pathways involved, some of them are doing what they’re supposed to but it’s become damaging, others have been disrupted by environmental factors.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to be clearer...</p>

<p>Generally speaking, muscles try to keep their glycogen stores full. If glucose is quite available - if you carb load - then you can stuff more glucose in. But once you reach that state, you can only pull in what you expend.</p>

<p>Or, to put it another way, muscles need to be in glucose balance.</p>

<p>Are you suggesting that muscles temporarily convert excess glucose to fat that is stored in muscles and then burned later? I didn&#39;t find any support for that in human studies...</p>

There’s a lot more evidence that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pubmed/26006245-soy-and-breast-cancer-focus-on-angiogenesis/">soy</a> intake during puberty is responsible. </p>

<p>I. Introduction</p>

<p>For the sake of clarity, the element iodine in all its forms will be identified in this manuscript with the letter I, whereas the name iodine will be reserved for the oxidized state I2. According to a recent editorial of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (1), one third of the world’s population lives in areas of I deficiency, which is the world’ leading cause of intellectual deficiency (2). I is an essential element and its essentiality is believed to be due to its requirement for the synthesis of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triodothyronine (T3). <strong>The recommended daily intake of I for adults of both sexes in North America and Western Europe varies from 150 to 300 ug (1).</strong> I deficiency results in goiter (enlarged thyroid gland) and hypothyroidism. The recommended levels for daily I intake were chosen with the goal of preventing and correcting endemic goiter and hypothyroidism, <strong>assuming</strong> that the only role of I in health maintenance is in its essentiality for the synthesis of T4 and T3.</p>

<p>Considering the importance of this element for overall wellbeing, it is most amazing that no study so far has attempted to answer the very important question: <strong>What is the optimal amount of daily I intake that will result in the greatest mental and physical levels of wellbeing in the majority of a population with a minimal degree of negative effects?</strong> In the studies designed to answer this question, consideration should be given to the possibility that I, at levels higher than those required to achieve normal thyroid function tests and absence of simple goiter, may have some very important thyroidal and extrathyroidal non T3-T4 related roles in overall wellbeing.</p>

<p>Some eighty years ago, D. Marine reported the results of his landmark study on the effect of I supplementation in the prevention and treatment of iodine-deficiency goiter. Based on extensive studies of goiter in farm animals, he estimated the amount of I that would be required for human subjects. He chose a population of adolescent school girls from the 5th to 12th grade between the ages of 10 and 18 years residing in Akron, Ohio, a city with a 56% incidence of goiter (3). His choice was based on the observation that the incidence of goiter was highest at puberty, and 6 times more common in girls than in boys (4). He studied two groups of pupils devoid of goiter (thyroid enlargement by palpation) at the beginning of the project. The control group consisted of 2305 pupils who did not receive I supplementation; and 2190 pupils received a total of 4 gm of sodium iodide per year for a period of 2 &amp;½ years. The amount of I was spread out in 2 doses of 2 gm each during the spring and during the fall. This 2 gm dose was administered in daily amounts of 0.2 gm of sodium iodide over 10 days. At 4000 mg of sodium iodide per 365 days, the daily amount is 12 mg, equivalent to 9 mg I. After 2 &amp;½ years of observation, 495 pupils in the control group developed thyroid enlargement (22%). Only 5 cases of goiter occurred in the I-supplementation group (0.2%). Iodism was observed in 0.5% of the pupils receiving I supplementation. In an area of Switzerland with an extremely high incidence of goiter (82 to 95%), Klinger, as reported by Marine (3), administered 10-15 mg of iodine weekly to 760 pupils of the same age group. The daily I intake in this group was 1.4-2 mg. The initial examination revealed 90% of them had enlarged thyroid. After 15 months of this program, only 28.3% of them still had an enlarged gland. <strong>None experienced iodism. In response to these studies, the Swiss Goiter Commission advised the use of I supplementation in all cantons. Iodized fat in tablet form containing 3 to 5 mg I per tablet was used for I supplementation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Due to the large consumption of seaweeds in the Japanese diet, this population ingests several milligrams of I daily without ill effects and in fact with some very good results evidenced by the very low incidence of fibrocystic disease of breast (5) and of the low mortality rates for cancers of the female reproductive organs (6).</strong> According to the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, the average daily intake of seaweed is 4.6 gm. At an average of 0.3% I content (range = 0.08-0.45%), <strong>that is an estimated daily I intake of 13.8 mg</strong> (7). Japanese living in the coastal areas consume more than 13.8 mg (7). Studies performed in some of the subjects living in the coastal areas, revealed that the thyroid glands exposed to those levels of I, organify more I than they secrete as T3 and T4 and the levels of T3 and T4 are maintained within a narrow range. The excess I is secreted as non hormonal I of unknown chemical composition, mostly as inorganic I (7). The intake of I in the non-coastal areas of Japan is less. A recent study of 2956 men and 1182 women residing in the non-coastal city of Sapporo, Japan (8), revealed a urine concentration of I in spot urine samples, with a mean value of 3.4 mg/L, corresponding to an estimated daily intake averaging 5.3 mg (5). This relatively low I intake by Japanese standard, is more than 30 times the recommended daily amount of I in North America and Europe (1).</p>

<p>B.V. Stadel, from the National Institute of Health, proposed in 1976 to test the hypothesis that the lower incidence and prevalence of breast dysfunctions and breast Ca; and the lower mortality rate from breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers observed in Japanese women living in Japan versus those women living in Hawaii and the continental US, was due their I intake (6). He suggested a prospective study with 2 groups of subjects recruited from the same population with a high incidence of the above pathologies: one control group on intakes of I from a Western diet at RDA levels, and the other intervention group, receiving I in amounts equivalent to that consumed by Japanese women living in Japan. So far, data from this type of prospective epidemiological research are not available in the published literature, regarding the incidence of cancer of the female reproductive organs in women receiving several mg of I daily as the only know variable, compared to women whose diet supplies RDA levels of I.</p>

<p>Data are available, however, regarding the effects of I, ingested in daily amounts of several mg on subjective and objective improvements of fibrocystic disease of the breast (FDB). In 1966, two Russian scientists (9) published their results regarding the effect of oral administration of potassium iodide in daily amounts equivalent to 10-20 mg I, on 200 patients with &quot;dyshormonal hyperphasia of mammary glands&quot;. They postulated that this form of mastopathy was due to excess estrogens from ovarian follicular cysts which were caused by insufficient consumption of I. The duration of I supplementation of their patients varied from 6 months to 3 years. Within 3 months, there was significant reduction of swelling, pain, diffuse induration and nodularity of the breast. Out of 167 patients who completed the program, a positive therapeutic effect was observed in 72% of them. In five patients with ovarian follicular cysts, there was a regression of the cystic ovaries following 5 months to one year of I supplementation. No side effects of I supplementation was reported in those patients.</p>

<p>Ghent et al (10) extended the Russian study further, using different amounts of different forms of I in women with FDB. Beginning in 1975, these Canadian investigators tested various amounts of various forms of I in three open trials. Lugol 5% solution was used in 233 patients for 2 years in daily amounts ranging from 31 to 62 mg I. They achieved clinical improvement in 70% of the patients. Thyroid function tests were affected in 4% of the patients and iodism was present in 3% of them. In 588 patients, using iodine caseinate at 10 mg/day for 5 years, only 40% success rate was achieved. In 1365 patients, using an aqueous saturated solution of iodine in daily amount based on body weight, estimated at 3-6 mg I/day, 74% of the patients had clinical improvements both subjectively from breast pain and objectively, form breast induration and nodularity. Iodism was present in only 0.1% in this last group. In a double blind study of 23 patients ingesting aqueous solution of iodine in amounts of 3 to 6 mg/day for a mean of 191 days, 65% showed objective and subjective improvement whereas in 33 patients on a placebo, 3% experienced worsening of objective signs and 35% experienced improvement in subjective breast pain. These data are summarized in Table I. Although the percent of subjects reporting side effects in Ghent’s studies appear high ranging from 7% to 10.9%, the authors stated that the incidence of iodism was relatively low and most complaints were minor such as increased breast pain at the onset of I supplementation, and complaint about the unpleasant taste of iodine.</p>

<p><strong>When the data from Marine’s, Klinger’s and Ghent’s studies (3,10) were evaluated regarding the incidence of iodism in relation to the daily amount of I ingested, a positive correlation was found between those 2 parameters: zero percent iodism at a daily amount of 1.4-2 mg; 0.1% iodism with 3-6 mg daily; 0.5% with 9 mg and 3% with 31-62 mg (Table II).</strong></p>

<div class="md"><p>We also has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/ay9p56/iodine_the_next_vitamin_d_part_i/">this previous discussion</a>.  I will repost my comment from there since it applies to the studies listed in this review:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would take any estimate of Japanese iodine intakes with a grain of salt (heh) unless they were measured with 24-hour urinary excretion.  24-hour food recalls and FFQs are way too unreliable due to the large variation in potential seaweed iodine levels (except <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27722921">this study</a> which actually measured seaweed levels and came to the same values as urine sample studies).  When you add it to other urine collection studies (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4696276/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5121429/">here</a>), we can see that the average excretion in Japan is 279-416 mcg/day.  Note there also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3976240/">risks</a> associated with excess iodine but the daily upper limit (in the US) is up at 1100 mcg (RDA 150 mcg for reasons described <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/10#273">here</a>), so there is a lot of room to play with intakes before reaching any concerning level (and even 1100 mcg appears safe for many people).</p>

<p>Personally, I shoot for 250 mcg per day but often get more than that.  I reach this value through food, iodized Lite Salt, and a kelp tablet every-so-often.  I haven&#39;t seen a single study linking increased risks with a daily intake of 250 mcg/day but would be interested in reading about that if anyone has any links.  From the literature, the 150 mcg RDA seems perhaps too low and I haven&#39;t seen any RCT support for going beyond 300 mcg.</p>

<p>Also note that if you are using seaweed for your major iodine source, ensure that the label actually lists an estimated iodine content so that you know exactly how much you are getting.  Seaweed levels can vary wildly and I wouldn&#39;t trust seaweeds as a reliable source without that information being listed.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So we should take more Iodine but taking it can also cause iodine poisoning?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a bit late to the party, but which form of Iodine would you recommend? Kelp, Potassium Iodid, Lugol, pure Iodine?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Continued</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 19th Edition of Remington’s Science and Practice of Pharmacy, published in 1995 (11), the recommended daily oral intake of Lugol 5% solution for I supplementation was between 0.1 and 0.3 ml. <strong>This time-tested Lugol solution has been available since 1829, when it was introduced by French physician Jean Lugol. The 5% Lugol solution contains 50 mg iodine and 100 mg potassium iodide per ml, with a total of 125 mg I/ml. The suggested daily amount of 0.1 ml is equivalent to 12.5 mg of I, with 5 mg iodine and 7.5 mg of iodide as the potassium salt. This amount of I is very close to 13.8 mg, the estimated daily intake of I in Japanese subjects living in Japan, based on seaweed consumption (7).</strong> Obviously, this quantity of I present in 4.6 gm of seaweed would have to be consumed daily to maintain the I intake at this level. As quoted by Ghent et al (10), in 1928 an autopsy series reported a 3% incidence of FDB, whereas in a 1973 autopsy report, the incidence of FDB increased markedly to 89% (10,12,13). Is it possible that the very low 3% incidence of FDB reported in the pre-RDA early 1900’s (12) was due to the widespread use of the Lugol solution available then from local apothecaries; and the recently reported 89% incidence of FDB (13) is due to a trend of decreasing I consumption (2) with such decreased levels still within RDA limits for I, therefore giving a false sense of I sufficiency?</p>

<p>This lengthy introduction could be justified in the present context by stating that this background information was necessary to set the stage for the present study.** If indeed, as suggested by Ghent et al, the amount of I required for breast normality is much higher than the RDA for I which is based on thyroid function tests and thyroid volume** (10), then the next question is: <strong>What is the optimal amount of I that will restore and maintain normal breast function and histology, without any significant side effects and negative impact on thyroid functions?</strong> From the studies referred to (9,10) and Table I, the range of daily I intake in the management of FDB was between 3 and 62 mg. From Table II, we observe that the incidence of iodism increased progressively from zero % at 2 mg to 3% at 31-62 mg.</p>

<p>Our goal was to assess the effect of a standardized fixed amount of I within the range of daily amount of I previously used in FDB, on blood chemistry, hematology, thyroid volume and function tests in clinically euthyroid women with normal thyroid volume by ultrasonometry; and subsequently trying the same in women with FDB if there was no evidence of toxicity and adverse effects on the thyroid gland. <strong>The equivalent of 0.1 ml of a 5% Lugol solution, that is 12.5 mg I was chosen, a value close to the average intake of 13.8 mg consumed in Japan</strong> (7), a country with a very low incidence of FDB (5); slightly higher than the 9 mg amount used in Marine’s original study (3) of adolescents, with a very low 0.5% incidence of iodism following this level of I supplementation; also within the range of the 10 to 20 mg amount used in the Russian study of FDB, without any side effects reported (8); and five times less than the largest amount of 62 mg used in Ghent’s studies with a 3% iodism reported (10).</p>

<p>Because administration of I in liquid solution is not very accurate, may stain clothing, has an unpleasant taste and causes gastric irritation, we decided to use a precisely quantified tablet form containing 5 mg iodine and 7.5 mg iodide as the potassium salt. To prevent gastric irritation, the iodine/iodide preparation was absorbed unto a colloidal silica excipient; and to eliminate the unpleasant taste of iodine, the tablets were coated with a thin film of pharmaceutical glaze. <strong>Ten clinically euthyroid caucasian women were evaluated before and 3 months after ingesting a tablet daily.</strong> The evaluation included thyroid function tests and assessments of thyroid volume by ultrasonometry. <strong>The results suggest that this form and amount of I administered daily for 3 months to euthyroid women had no detrimental effect on thyroid volume and functions</strong>. Some statistically significant changes were observed in the mean values of certain tests of urine analysis, thyroid function, hematology and blood chemistry following I supplementation. These mean values were within the reference range, except for mean platelet volume (MPV) with a mean value below the reference range prior to supplementation, but the mean MPV value increased to reach a level within the normal range following I supplementation. In 2 subjects, baseline TSH levels were above 5.6 mIU/L, the upper limit for the reference range of the clinical laboratory used in this study.
 In both subjects, I supplementation markedly suppressed TSH levels.</p>

<p>The article argues that the RDA was set to correct endemic goiter but that there are other non goiter related benefits of iodine at higher levels. This is quite reminiscent of vitamin-d  where the RDA hav been (and sometimes still is) to low due to only looking at preventing rickets while we now know that there are other none rickets functions of vitamin-d that warrants a higher RDA. <a href="https://vitamindwiki.com/Vitamin+D+and+Iodine+are+similar%2C+and+both+are+deficient+and+important+to+health">article on vitamin-d iodine similarities</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>...</p>

<p>Iodine deficiency is associated with (2,3,4):</p>

<ul>
<li>fibrocystic breast disease leading to breast cancer, stomach cancer,</li>
<li>goiter (enlarged thyroid)</li>
<li>mental issues from reduced alertness, lowered IQ, autism to cretinism, lack of iodine for the fetus leads to cretinism, and in milder cases to autism and ADHD</li>
<li>slow metabolism, leading to tiredness, sluggishness, fatigue, apathy, depression and insomnia,</li>
<li>inability to produce saliva, dry skin and lack of sweating,</li>
<li>lack of optimal detoxification, especially of bromides, fluorides and heavy metals</li>
<li>sensitivity to temperature changes, cold hands and feet,</li>
<li>muscle pain, fibrosis, fibromyalgia,</li>
<li>erectile dysfunction, infertility and miscarriages, low sex drive,</li>
<li>overweight,</li>
<li>high blood pressure, increased incidence of heart attacks and strokes</li>
</ul>

<p>The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has published probable safe upper limits for dietary intake of iodine (5). They range from 150 micrograms (mcg) per kilogram (kg) per day in newborn infants to 30mcg/kg/day in adults. That is 2 milligrams (2,000 micrograms) daily for a 146-pound adult. The safe upper limit is higher during pregnancy and lactation (40 mcg/kg/day).</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The iodine-cancer connection</p>

<p>The body requires iodine to metabolize both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. A substance called delta-iodolactone, a derivative of arachidonic acid, which is produced in the thyroid gland and breast tissue, prostate, colon, and the nervous system, is a regulator of a process called cellular apoptosis (&quot;cell death&quot;). Ascorbic acid is required to stimulate intracellular hydrogen peroxide synthesis that, in turn, provides the energy to make iodine free radicals necessary for this reaction. When the level of delta-iodolactone is high enough, the process of apoptosis can then kill cancer cells.(15)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for iodine - about 150 mcg per day - will not allow delta-iodolactone to be efficiently formed in the thyroid gland. The thyroid requires higher iodine concentrations to efficiently produce it. Researchers have found that 100 times the RDA amount of iodine is optimal to produce delta-iodolactone. That equates to taking about 15 mg of iodine per day (15,16). These findings are important because they imply that there are some biochemical reactions that require much larger amounts of iodine than the current RDA. The mechanism by which delta-iodolactone induces cell death may be an important pathway for curing some types of cancer.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>The established RDA allowance for iodine (150 mcg/day) is inadequate for many individuals. In order to maintain optimum health, adults need 2-5 mg of iodide daily. Actually, this is in line with the upper safe limit of dietary intake of iodine established by FAO (30 mcg/kg/day). In case of a dysfunctional thyroid or other illnesses, such as fibrocystic breast disease or cancer, 15-50 mg daily may be needed. Ask your doctor about the alternatives to hormone therapy or taking iodine-containing organic drugs, because inexpensive orthoiodosupplementation would usually not be his/her first choice.</p>

<p>The best and safest form of iodine supplementation for a healthy adult is iodide. Iodides are naturally produced in larger quantities by various seaweeds.</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>There is some evidence that suggests that. </p>

<p>its not uncommon for nutrients to have a potential for adverse effects if consumed in excess.  optimal amount is not necessarily the same for different people. </p>

<p>The risk with with iodine according to this data seems to start around 3-9 mg (0.1-0.5% risk). current RDA is 0.15-0.3mg. </p>

<p>It seems like there is therapeutic potential in the thyroid risk zone so higher might be warranted for some individuals but they should probably monitor their thyroid if they consume that much. Some claim that consuming extra selenium completely removes the risk for thyroid problems, i have not seen what data they have to justify this claim so cant comment on that.</p>

<p>This sections suggest that the risks might be lower than this data suggests. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>...</p>

<p>The potentially adverse effects of I supplementation at the levels used in the present study are threefold: iodism, I-induced hyperthyroidism (IIH) and I-induced goiter (IIG). Iodism is dose-related, and the symptoms are unpleasant brassy taste, increased salivation, coryza, sneezing, and headache originating in the frontal sinuses. Skin lesions are mildly acneiform and distributed in the seborrheic areas.11,43 Those symptoms disappear spontaneously within a few days after stopping the administration of I. As of this writing, no iodism, and for that matter, no side effect has been reported in more than 150 subjects who underwent I supplementation at 12.5 mg/day. It was suggested 100 years ago that iodism may be due to small amounts of bromine contaminant in the iodine preparations and trace amount of iodate and iodic acid in the iodide solutions.43 With greater purity of USP grade materials now available, iodism may no longer be a problem at the level of I used in the present study.</p>

<p>If they are randomized trials, could you point me directly towards a few of them?  The ones in the chart you posted are all related to fibrocystic breasts which are apparently common and not dangerous.  And did any of those studies measure TSH levels?  That&#39;s the first-line indicator for excessive iodine consumption.  &#39;Iodism&#39; shouldn&#39;t be our clinical endpoint, rather we should be shooting for an intake much lower than what will lead to any potential toxic symptoms, especially if the benefits are uncertain.</p>

<p>Here is the relevant section:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Data Selection. The appropriate data for derivation of a UL for adults are those relating intake to thyroid dysfunction shown by elevated TSH concentrations. Studies conducted in countries with a history of inadequate iodine intake were not included in this review because of the altered response of TSH to iodine intake.</p>

<p>Identification of No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) and Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (LOAEL). Gardner and coworkers (1988) evaluated TSH concentrations in 30 adult men aged 22 to 40 years who received 500, 1,500, or 4,500 μg/day of supplemental iodide for 2 weeks. Baseline urinary iodine excretion was 287 μg/day; therefore baseline iodine intake from food is estimated to be approximately 300 μg/day. The mean basal serum TSH concentration increased significantly in those receiving the two higher doses, although it remained within the normal range. This study shows a LOAEL of 1,500 plus 300 μg/day, for a total of 1,800 μg/day.</p>

<p>In a similar study (Paul et al., 1988), nine men aged 26 to 56 years and 23 women aged 23 to 44 years received iodine supplements of 250, 500, or 1,500 μg/day for 14 days. Baseline urinary iodine excretion was 191 μg/day. Because greater than 90 percent of dietary iodine is excreted in urine (Nath et al., 1992), it was estimated that the baseline iodine intake was approximately 200 μg. Those receiving 1,500 μg/day of iodide showed a significant increase in baseline and TRH-stimulated serum TSH, effects not seen in the two lower doses. No subjects in this study had detectable antithyroid antibodies. The conclusion would be that an iodine intake of about 1,700 μg/ day increased TSH secretion. Both of the above studies support a LOAEL between 1,700 and 1,800 μg/day. Thus, the lowest LOAEL of 1,700 μg/day was selected.</p>

<p>Uncertainty Assessment. There is little uncertainty regarding the range of iodine intakes that are likely to induce elevated TSH concentration over baseline. A LOAEL of 1,700 μg/day and a NOAEL of 1,000 to 1,200 μg/day are estimated for adult humans. This results in an uncertainty factor (UF) of 1.5 to derive a NOAEL from a LOAEL. A higher uncertainty factor was not considered because of the mild, reversible nature of elevated TSH over baseline.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The symptoms of iodine poisoning range from fairly mild to severe, depending on how much iodine is in your system.</p>

<p>More mild symptoms of iodine poisoning include:</p>

<ul>
<li>diarrhea</li>
<li>burning sensation in your mouth</li>
<li>nausea</li>
<li>vomiting</li>
</ul>

<p>Severe symptoms of iodine poisoning include:</p>

<ul>
<li>swelling of your airways</li>
<li>turning blue (cyanosis)</li>
<li>weak pulse</li>
<li>coma</li>
</ul>

<p>Consuming too much iodine can also lead to a condition called iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. This usually happens when people take iodine supplements to improve their thyroid function.</p>

<p>Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include:</p>

<ul>
<li>fast heart rate</li>
<li>muscle weakness</li>
<li>warm skin</li>
<li>unexplained weight loss</li>
</ul>

<p>Hyperthyroidism is particularly dangerous if you have an underlying heart condition, since it affects your heart rate.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>...</p>

<p>The potentially adverse effects of I supplementation at the levels used in the present study are threefold: iodism, I-induced hyperthyroidism (IIH) and I-induced goiter (IIG). <strong>Iodism is dose-related, and the symptoms are unpleasant brassy taste, increased salivation, coryza, sneezing, and headache originating in the frontal sinuses. Skin lesions are mildly acneiform and distributed in the seborrheic areas.11,43 Those symptoms disappear spontaneously within a few days after stopping the administration of</strong> I. As of this writing, no iodism, and for that matter, no side effect has been reported in more than 150 subjects who underwent I supplementation at 12.5 mg/day. <strong>It was suggested 100 years ago that iodism may be due to small amounts of bromine contaminant in the iodine preparations and trace amount of iodate and iodic acid in the iodide solutions.43 With greater purity of USP grade materials now available, iodism may no longer be a problem at the level of I used in the present study.</strong> </p>

<p>Results</p>

<p>Clinically, there were significant improvements of mastodynia (p=0.004), tremor (p=0.048), and restless leg
(p=0.009) (Table 3). There was no statistically significant effect of I supplementation on blood pressure,
body temperature and body composition (Table 4).
Percent body fat reached a near significant drop
(p=0.075).
Regarding laboratory evaluation of the subjects, results
of urine analysis were normal in all subjects pre- and
post-I supplementation. The only statistically significant effect of I was on urine pH (p=0.012) with preand post-I values (mean ± SD) respectively of
6.05±0.69 and 7.00±0.85. (Reference Range: 5.0-8.5).
Out of 17 different measurements performed on blood
chemistry, nine were affected significantly by I supplementation: a drop in creatinine (p&lt;0.01), calcium
(p=0.04), albumin (p&lt;0.01), A/G ratio (p&lt;0.01), alkaline phosphatase (p&lt;0.01); and a rise in sodium </p>

<p>(p=0.01), carbon dioxide (p=0.02), globulin (p=0.01),
and SGPT levels (p&lt;0.01). However, all those values
remained well within the reference ranges for these
parameters (Table 5). Three hematological measurements out of the 13 assessed were significantly altered
by the intervention: a drop in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (p&lt;0.01) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) (p&lt;0.01); and a rise in mean platelet volume (MPV) (p=0.04). Although the above differences
were statistically significant, they represented a small
percentage of the mean values compared (Table 6).
The values for MCH and MCV were within the reference ranges both pre- and post-I supplementation.
However, the mean value for MPV (± SD) was below
the normal range of 8.2-10.3 ƒl prior to intervention
(7.5±1.3 ƒl) and increased to reach the normal range
following I supplementation (8.2±1.3 ƒl). Although
MPV below 4 ƒl is an indication of a compromised immune system, this slightly low mean value prior to I</p>

<p>supplementation may not be of clinical significance.
Nevertheless, the effect of I supplementation was beneficial on this parameter.
The data on thyroid function tests and thyroid volume
are displayed in Table 7. Thyroid volume in all the
subjects were below 18 ml, the upper limit of normal
values reported,14,15 suggesting that their intake of I
prior to this study was adequate to prevent enlargement
of the thyroid gland, and to maintain normal thyroid
hormones, since all these values were within normal
limits. Serum T4 levels dropped significantly (p&lt;0.01)
from a mean of 8.8 (SD=1.3) to 7.2 ug/dL (SD=1.1).
However, all individual values remained within the
reference range (Table 7). Mean serum TSH levels
decreased following I intake from 4.4 mIU/L to 3.2
mIU/L. This non-significant decrease was due to the
marked fall in subjects #1 and #10, with 16 mIU/L decrease between these two subjects. Using the classification of subclinical hypothyrodism as clinical euthyroidism with normal levels of thyroid hormones but
elevated TSH above 6 mIU/L,20-22 subjects #1 and #10
would be classified as subclinical hypothyroid before I
supplementation.</p>

<p>I mean, it was an n=10 study with no control group and the authors of the paper promoting these results are selling an iodine supplement.

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Seafood has good nutritional benefits, some say more so than eating something like chicken or steak, due to it&#39;s fat and oils increasing omega 3 content.</p>

<p>However, seafood has issues with microplastic and other things like mercury.</p>

<p>Does the health benefits from eating seafood worth getting these bad substances into our system?</p>

<p>As another question, what about for the case of a vegetarian, who doesn&#39;t eat meat but is fine with eating oysters. Would eating oysters as a vegetarian, so a means of consuming both an animal product/meat, and fatty 3 omega oils, be worth to consume despite microplastic and mercury being in the oyster?</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>Generally, the evidence suggests yes (and I say this as a 10 year plant based eater).</p>

<p>It&#39;s not environmentally sustainable, and fish appear to be conscious beings. But pescetarians do as well or better than vegans in prospective epidemiology.</p>

<p>Orlich et al, 2013. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/articlepdf/1710093/ioi130047.pdf">Vegetarian dietary patterns and mortality in Adventist Health Study 2</a>. <em>JAMA internal medicine</em>, <em>173</em>(13), pp.1230-1238.</p>

<p>For health concerns, I would avoid fish at higher trophic levels, and with higher methylmercury and persistent organic pollutant content, like Chilean bass, bluefish, grouper, lingcod, mackerel, marlin, orange roughy, pike, shark, swordfish, tilefish, most trout, tuna, and weakfish. The preferred lower methylmercury seafood would be clams, cod, herring, mullet, mussels, oyster, salmon, sardine, scallops, shad, shrimp, sole, squid, tilapia, and farmed trout.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Bottled water has microplastics, as far as I can tell we have polluted the entire earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does the health benefits from eating seafood worth getting these bad substances into our system?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think so, you need to decide for yourself.  Oysters have zinc, B12, selenium, etc.  Canned fish like sardines (bone in especially) and salmon have O3, calcium and protein.</p>

<p>You can find these elsewhere from non-animal sources, sure.  I am curious if anyone has looked at microplastic content in tofu.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The main benefit of seafood is the high levels of omega 3 (specifically EPA &amp; DHA).  There is good evidence that it&#39;s the ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 that is most important, not the absolute intake of omega 3.  A person can get a very good ratio of O3 to O6 without eating seafood.  It requires one to avoid foods high in Omega 6 like vegetable oils and chicken.  A diet of beef and broccoli for instance has an excellent ratio of O3 to O6.</p>

<p>If supplementation is required to achieve a good ratio (due to O6 consumption or lack of EPA/DHA in a vegan diet), fish oil supplements are cheap and should be devoid of mercury.  Old or low quality supplements can be overly oxidized however.  I&#39;m not sure about microplastics, but I doubt they would be a significant source.  Algae-based supplements also exist but I cannot say whether they are healthier.</p>

<p>The other nutrient that is unusually abundant in some seafood is Vitamin D.  It&#39;s very easy to supplement with however.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>“Fatty 3 omega oils” what the fuck is that</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Bottled water has microplastics, as far as I can tell we have polluted the entire earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So true. I grit my teeth anytime someone brings up fish contamination because it seems to me that our entire food supply is contaminated by one thing or another. I generally see the fish contamination argument as plant-based propaganda. It&#39;s the only way to demonize the one animal source (seafood) which isn&#39;t high in saturated fat or cholesterol.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>here we go again... please check the bioavailability of o3 in ALA which is the prevalent kind even in grass-fed beef and exclusively in all the plant-based bullshit marketed as high in omega 3 fats, it&#39;s  3-10% at best, never an adequate option.</p>

<p>Your only option for highly bioavailable o3 (DHA/EPA) really is fish, ideally with o3 in phospholipid form (salmon roe for example).</p>

<p>fish oil supplements are highly suspect in quality. get canned cod liver, a can of 100g has ~14g of omega 3&#39;s and costs like 1-2 dollars.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Fish and seaweed are really the only foods with serious mercury, arsenic, PCB, PCDB, dioxin, and DDT contamination issues, I don’t think that’s propaganda. Still, all the epidemiology links fish consumption with less disease and mortality, so it seems the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>“Objective To evaluate the association of changes in red meat consumption with total and cause specific mortality in women and men.</p>

<p>Design Two prospective cohort studies with repeated measures of diet and lifestyle factors.</p>

<p>Setting Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, United States.</p>

<p>Participants 53 553 women and 27 916 men without cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline.</p>

<p>Main outcome measure Death confirmed by state vital statistics records, the national death index, or reported by families and the postal system.</p>

<p>Results 14 019 deaths occurred during 1.2 million person years of follow-up. Increases in red meat consumption over eight years were associated with a higher mortality risk in the subsequent eight years among women and men (both P for trend&lt;0.05, P for heterogeneity=0.97). An increase in total red meat consumption of at least half a serving per day was associated with a 10% higher mortality risk (pooled hazard ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.17). For processed and unprocessed red meat consumption, an increase of at least half a serving per day was associated with a 13% higher mortality risk (1.13, 1.04 to 1.23) and a 9% higher mortality risk (1.09, 1.02 to 1.17), respectively. A decrease in consumption of processed or unprocessed red meat of at least half a serving per day was not associated with mortality risk. The association between increased red meat consumption and mortality risk was consistent across subgroups defined by age, physical activity, dietary quality, smoking status, or alcohol consumption.</p>

<p>Conclusion Increases in red meat consumption, especially processed meat, were associated with higher overall mortality rates.”</p>

</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>Another interesting tidbit from the analysis.</p>

<p>&quot;A decrease in processed meat and a simultaneous increase in whole  grains, vegetables, or other protein sources was even more strongly  associated with lower total mortality, with the largest reductions in  risk seen with increases in nuts (0.74, 0.70 to 0.79) and fish (0.75,  0.68 to 0.84). <em>We found that a decrease in unprocessed red meat and a  simultaneous increase in other protein sources except for legumes, whole  grains, vegetables, or dairy was also associated with a substantially  lower risk of death.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>This seems to show a healthy diet bias, though NOT increasing whole grains or vegetables was still associated with a lower (relative, all of these are relative) risk of death if red meat is replaced with fish or other protein sources, probably chicken since legumes were excluded.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>If red meat (and they conflated fresh meat with processed meat, as usual, &quot;A decrease in consumption of <strong>processed or unprocessed red meat</strong> of at  least half a serving per day was not associated with mortality risk.&quot;) was causal then we would see a decrease in these diseases with the stated decrease in red meat consumption.  As we have not, it&#39;s a waste of resources to keep beating this drum with weak epidemiology, instead of looking for the actual cause.</p>

<p>From the journal rapid response is this first <del>published</del> [edit: posted] comment that makes that argument.  <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/365/bmj.l2110/rapid-responses">https://www.bmj.com/content/365/bmj.l2110/rapid-responses</a></p>

<p>&quot; The Introduction of the paper states:</p>

<ol>
<li>&quot;A large body of evidence has shown that higher red meat consumption,  especially processed red meat, is associated with an increased risk of  type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer,  including colorectal cancer,  and mortality.</li>
<li>&quot;The average consumption of red meat in the United States has decreased in recent decades...&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>The Conclusion states: &quot;Increases in red meat consumption, especially  processed meat, were associated with higher overall mortality rates.&quot;</p>

<p>Therefore, decreases in red meat consumption should cause a decrease  in the prevalence of these diseases. But we have had a decline in the  quantity of red meat consumption, while concurrently witnessing a huge  increase in the prevalence of these diseases.  [See my references below]</p>

<p>The hazard ratios in this epidemiological study are too low to be of  significance, and the author&#39;s conclusions are clearly countered by what  they state in the introduction. It is my opinion that this paper is of  no value.</p>

<li>The American Cancer Society lowered our colorectal cancer screening  recommended starting age to 45 for people of average risk. The guideline  was changed, based in part, on new data showing rates of colorectal  cancer are increasing in younger populations. <a href="https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/study-finds-sharp-rise-in-colon-cancer-and-rectal-cancer-rates-among-young-adults.html"><em>https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/study-finds-sharp-rise-in-colon-cancer-and-rectal-cancer-rates-among-young-adults.html</em></a></li>
<li>“Consistent with previous trends, our research shows that diabetes cases  are still increasing, although not as quickly as in previous years,”  said Ann Albright, Ph.D., R.D., director of CDC’s Division of Diabetes  Translation.  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p0718-diabetes-report.html">https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p0718-diabetes-report.html</a></li>
<li>&quot;Heart disease and cancer are the first and second leading causes of  death in the United States.

<p>I&#39;m a little confused what you mean by this statement, would you explain?  It doesn&#39;t sound like you&#39;re using &quot;significance&quot; in a statistical sense.</p>

<p>You constantly bash epidemiology but then follow up by using the absolute worst form of epidemiology. You are pointing to a single correlation with zero adjustment for confounding factors. Do you think *the decrease in red meat consumption is the only thing to change?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I see you&#39;ve edited your comment with a reference and this is appreciated, but what we mean by engaging the evidences is engaging with the paper presented from the original post. Your comment would be more helpful if instead of critizing the author of the study, you were explaining why you think this specific study results are wrong. Are they contradicted by higher, more rigorous studies? Is there a problem with the methodology, the design, the statistics, the population? Etc etc. Maybe what you say about Walter Willet is true (or not) but this does not invalidate this study per se. Feel free to post a new comment that engage the study, and not its author, posted in the original post.</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean about &quot;each food group&quot; and had trouble finding that in the paper, can you quote what they did?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Two of my three sources were the CDC referring to American data.    Did you not follow the links?</p>

<p>The statement you quote is from the accepted letter submitted regarding the paper.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I consistently oppose epidemiology presented as causal, and anything but a very small increase in relative risk.  Responding to weak epidemiology with weak epidemiology, well, what else can one do?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Ok read the damn title.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It’s mentioned in a few places:</p>

<p>“total energy intake, and other main food groups, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and sugar-sweetened beverages (all in fifths)...We also examined the risk of death associated with a decrease in red meat by one serving per day and a simultaneous increase of one serving per day of poultry (no skin), fish, dairy products, eggs, legumes, nuts, whole grains, or vegetables (no legumes). We included concurrent changes in all these food sources, in addition to red meat, in the same multivariable model. The difference in the β coefficients for change in red meat and change in the alternative food was used to estimate the hazard ratio; the corresponding variances and covariance were used to estimate 95% confidence intervals.24...We also modeled associations of a decrease of one serving per day of red meat substituted with an alternative food over four years with total mortality in the subsequent four years, and the same substitution over 12 years with total mortality in the subsequent 12 years..Further adjustment of initial traditional risk factors, initial and concurrent changes in lifestyle, calorie intake, and other food consumption did not substantially change the results for increased consumption...The association of changes in red meat consumption with mortality was consistent across participants, irrespective of age, physical activity level, dietary quality,..initial and simultaneous changes in physical activity, alcohol intake, total energy intake, and other main food groups, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and sugar-sweetened beverages (all in fifths).”</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t just draw numbers from dissimilar studies, even if two out of the three came from the same organization.  What you&#39;re essentially wanting to do is a meta-analysis, except disregarding <em>literally every</em> bit of statistics that goes into that.  </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t understand that there are a vast amount of confounding variables that change over time with regards to peoples health, and also between two unrelated studies, then I don&#39;t know what to tell you.  Just know that what you&#39;re trying to do makes 0 sense in statistics.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The statement you quote is from the accepted letter submitted regarding the paper.</p>

<p>It is not an accepted letter. It is a &quot;Rapid Response&quot;. It is just a random comment from the public. In this case a pest controller from California (who at least has a BA in Bio from Berkeley).</p>

<div class="md"><p>There’s a difference between a prospective cohort that follows people for over 40 years, collects questionnaires every 2 years, adjusts for dozens of confounding variables, etc. and noting that Americans ate less red meat but are sicker. Americans are also buying more organic foods but are sicker. How can you not see the difference between a well designed study and your observation? What you did is not epidemiology, it’s not research, it wouldn’t get published in a predatory journal.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I appreciate that you want to contribute to this sub. </p>

<p>From our Posting Guidelines, first point of posting comment, it is said</p>

<p>Do you feel, as it is, that your comment is helpful for other reader of the sub? We want to encourage thoughtful discussion about the evidences presented. What idea or evidence did you present that other users can discuss with you? Correlation isn&#39;t causation is basic epidemiology science. Not even something worthy of mentionning on this sub if you ask me. I&#39;m quite sure we all know that observational studies can&#39;t establish a causal link. Beyond that, what else can we say about this specific study? </p>

<p>Look at <a href="/u/flowersandmtns">/u/flowersandmtns</a> comments in this thread. This user is arguing the same thing that you are (the shortcoming of observational studies) but with actual reflexion/reference about the issue that people can then debate.  </p>

<p>This is more in line with what we expect on this sub. </p>

<p>Hopefully this is coming across as constructive criticism, because this is what I am trying to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Where does it state causation? Both the conclusion and the title use  &quot;association&quot; That word is used to denote correlation, not causation.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Your comment here makes no sense.  I quoted a response to the paper, complete with a link to the letter the other person wrote and his name.  Did you miss that?</p>

<p>The  letter, which I quoted, made the argument that the paper argues both  that red meat consumption is lower and that diseases like cancer and T2D  are on the rise.</p>

<p>IF the causal factor  their epidemiological associations, showing weak associations of  relative risk, was red meat then these diseases CAUSED by red meat  consumption should decline as consumption declines.  Instead they have  increased.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t quote studies, I merely provided sources from the CDC to back up the arguments of that letter (which I agree with but didn&#39;t think I could just steal his argument and put it here!).</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yes, and I didn&#39;t want to make his argument for him without quoting him (also giving a link to the paper since i had to look it up).  I didn&#39;t realize they did not take editorial control over the letters and I&#39;ll update my first comment.</p>

<p>I think his argument is valid.  Aren&#39;t we all random people discussing papers here?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I linked data from the CDC, you are calling them what about predatory journals?   What I did was quote the CDC about American increases in cancer and T2D, despite the study you quoted pointing out Americans are eating less red meat overall.   </p>

<p>The weak epidemiological associations of the paper, showing small RELATIVE RISK changes based on food recall questionnaires with known issues about reliability, are interesting at some level, but not particularly informative.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>When you see a headline that states very clearly corralation equals causation there is just no reason to go any further. Why would there be? Oh, and as often as I see it here, you should all be ashamed of yourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Correlation: total and cause specific mortality among US women and men: two prospective cohort studies</p>

<p>Causation: :Association of changes in red meat consumption</p>

<p>Please learn how to read studies.</p>

<p>Also, I would bet my ass it was 100% self reported data.</p>

<p>Also, how do you account for Simpson&#39;s Paradox?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>You&#39;re assuming those diseases are solely caused by red meat consumption.  Literally no one has said that.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>You are clearly trolling or being disingenuous. Yes you cited the CDC regarding figures on increases in prevalence of certain disease. But you are then pointing out that red meat consumption has been decreasing inferring that if red meat is bad diseases shouldn’t be more prevalent. You aren’t adjusting for physical activity, sedentary behavior, air pollution, other dietary changes, or any of the other million things that can and do affect disease risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>You&#39;d benefit from learning what association, correlation, and causation mean and the differences between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yes, literally people say that all the time and they wave these weak epidemiological associations showing very small changes in relative risk (which is rarely clearly explained as NOT absolute risk) from the association they find with processed red meat.</p>

<p>They write their papers, plumbing the same food questionnaire based data, full of a focus on writing things like, &quot;A large body of evidence has shown that higher red meat consumption,  especially processed red meat, is associated with an increased risk of  type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer,  including colorectal cancer,  and mortality.&quot;</p>

<p>So why are we talking about these diseases and (processed!!) red meat anyway?  What significance is there to your &quot;solely&quot;?  </p>

<p>If red meat is only a factor in the presence of being consumed with processed and refined wheat and seed oils, then is the issue at all with processed red meat <em>or the other factors -- namely processed food in general unrelated to animal products</em>?  These sorts of papers tell us nothing new, they are rehashing the same data and drawing the same weak epidemiological associations.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I am neither.  You are confused.</p>

<p>I quoted a response to the paper, complete with a link to the letter.</p>

<p>The letter, which I quoted, made the argument that the paper argues both that red meat consumption is lower and that diseases like cancer and T2D are on the rise.</p>

<p>IF the causal factor their epidemiological associations, showing weak associations of relative risk, was red meat then these diseases CAUSED by red meat consumption should decline as consumption declines.  Instead they have increased.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Really? After I just pointed it all out to you? After I split it up, and showed you how it is. Really? So tired of the trolls on this site.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Can you go ahead and quote me all the relevant parts of this and other papers that say that &quot;red meat is the sole cause of&quot; various diseases?  According to you it happens &quot;literally&quot; all the time, but I&#39;ve yet to see a single person say that.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The rapid response you linked isn’t some peer reviewed paper it’s a comment via BMJs rapid response  system.</p>

<p>The CDC links you provided say nothing about meat.</p>

<p>My comment: “What you did is not epidemiology, it’s not research, it wouldn’t get published in a predatory journal.” was referring to the idea that if meat is bad and meat consumption is lower why isn’t disease lower. My answer is there are a million factors and you are looking only at one without adjusting for any other factor.</p>

<p>Why did you accuse me of calling the CDC a predatory journal when I was clearly commenting on the idiocy of saying “Therefore, decreases in red meat consumption should cause a decrease in the prevalence of these diseases. But we have had a decline in the quantity of red meat consumption, while concurrently witnessing a huge increase in the prevalence of these diseases.” which was a rapid response and thus non peer reviewed comment in BMJ?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What you pointed out isn&#39;t correct. I&#39;m not trolling.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t change the goalposts. You wrote &quot;Literally no one has said that.&quot;  Then you demand papers but finish with how you have yet to see a single PERSON say that.</p>

<p>Come on.  This is no longer a discussion of the paper, much less about the argument about the usefulness of the paper&#39;s weak relative risk associations with cancer, when red meat consumption is declining while cancer rates are increasing.</p>

<p>If the epidemiological results were at all useful or applicable outside the groups studied, then would align with the population level changes in cancer.  They do not.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Ok so you do now get that I quoted a letter in response to the paper. That&#39;s something, I guess.</p>

<p>And, yes, of course my CDC quotes say nothing about meat!  How can you still not understand that in the letter I quoted there was nothing backing up the point about cancer rates, so I included data about cancer rates?  I had assumed that was obvious.</p>

<p>I was quite baffled by your phrase predatory journal since it&#39;s as weird as the rest of your comments here.  Whatever.</p>

<p>You apparently consider the argument that cancer rates rising when red processed meat consumption has declined to be idiocy, but I think it has more merit than yet another tired rehash of food frequency questionnaire data showing weak relative risk associations for only processed red meat (but not chicken apparently).</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Prove it then. Stop yapping you gums and show me some evidence.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Fair enough, then quote a single person who said what you are representing as a mainstream argument.  I&#39;m waiting.</p>

<p>You really don&#39;t understand how statistics works do you.  Whether red meat hurts longevity or not has no correlation to either consumption, or the populations disease rate.  It just doesn&#39;t.  I haven&#39;t seen a single paper, or person claim that it does other than you.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Are you not familiar with predatory journals? Serious question </p>

<blockquote>

<p>How is a correlation without adjustments of more merit than a correlation with a multitude of confounding factors accounted for?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>All the information you need is in the replies I&#39;ve made. If you were less emotional about it you might see what I&#39;m saying.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What is the point of this paper? It tells us nothing new and is the same rehash of weak epidemiological results showing small relative risk changes for processed red meat.  But now they get to claim there is &#39;even more evidence&#39; about red meat and cancer.  </p>

<p>You are the one who introduced the work &quot;solely&quot; so I&#39;m not obligated to find your pet phrase. However,  <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/06/harvard-study-links-red-meat-consumption-with-early-death/">Increasing red meat consumption, especially of processed meats, is linked with a higher risk of premature death</a>.  Note their use of the word linked.  That&#39;s pretty strong for weak associations of small relative risks.</p>

<p>You claim I don&#39;t understand statistics -- do you understand epidemiology and public health?  I don&#39;t think you do.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t been emotional at all.</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t provided any evidence for your claim, we will feel free to disregard.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What is the point of this paper?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It explains that in the paper.</p>

<p>Yes I used the word &quot;solely&quot; to describe how you think that everyone is describing these studies and the results.  You very clearly were saying that at a minimum others thought that red meat was an overwhelming cause of disease, and at most saying that red meat was the only cause of disease.</p>

<p>Linked is a synonym for correlation.  It has nothing to do with causation, overwhelming causation, or sole causation.  So you can&#39;t find a single example, that&#39;s exactly what I thought.  I hope you realize no one believes what you are trying to straw man.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I found an example.  Just like you previously moving goal posts, I&#39;m not suprrised you don&#39;t accept it.</p>

<p>I think the mainstream press and places like Harvard use weak epidemiological associations like this to make <em>recommendations</em>.  They do have an article that focused on recommending people put down their cold cuts (since this is largely just about processed red meat) in which they explain these are RELATIVE RISKS, and small.  </p>

<p>I certainly did not use the word you did, OVERWHELMING.  I leave the breathless reporting like that to the press.  Have you truly not noticed?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>No, that was not even close to what you were claiming.  Not even in the same ballpark.  I honestly don&#39;t know if you are playing dumb or really don&#39;t understand the key issue here?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say you used that word, why do you keep getting upset at particular words I use to characterize what you said?  The only way a single factor could change the course of disease over all other variables (which is what you said), is if it&#39;s impact is overwhelming or the sole cause.  It&#39;s an asinine position to take, and I&#39;m just trying to help you understand why.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The asinine position is the one where major dietary changes were recommended because &quot;studies&quot; (aka Keyes, et al.) claimed that cholesterol was causal in heart disease.</p>

<p>&quot;In short, Keys was arguing that more Americans were dying of heart  disease, and that this was due to high cholesterol levels caused by  fatty diets.&quot;  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jhmas/article/70/2/218/776256">https://academic.oup.com/jhmas/article/70/2/218/776256</a></p>

<p>What I see being done with this paper and others is an attempt to make a larger and larger pile of weak epidemiological associations such that people can point to all of those studies, when none of them has more than very small RELATIVE risk adjustments.</p>

<p>Since the impact is so very small, and you seem to agree that it is a small effect, how is this paper even useful to informing public nutritional choices?  </p>

<p>Even if it was not the sole cause (and it isn&#39;t), if it had ANY effect you would expect to see SOME positive effect on public health metrics in response to changes that align with what this paper sees as a very small relative risk effect.</p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, this effect is so small that pouring all this money and research hours and data analysis would be better served looking at something useful.  It&#39;s a philosophical point.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>you would expect to see SOME positive effect on public health metrics in response to changes</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You would see benefits if all other variables were held constant</strong>.  What are you not understanding about this?  You rail at epidemiology and don&#39;t seem to even understand the very basics?</p>

<div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/14">Here</a> the chapter discussion how the US RDA for zinc was established.  Masterjohn also has an <a href="https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/podcast/2017/03/04/manage-zinc-status/">extensive podcast episode</a> on zinc.</p>

<p>The comment you linked to is highly suspicious since the poster made no mention of risks due to zinc supplementation at those levels (primarily copper deficiency).  It certainly wouldn&#39;t hurt to get an extra 5-10 mg of zinc during your recovery but there are no RCTs supporting levels anywhere near 50 mg/day.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind there are <em>many</em> dietary components that impact wound healing such as various B vitamins, the antioxidant vitamins (especially C and E), vitamin D, selenium, iron, magnesium, protein, omega-3&#39;s, etc.  Also, I&#39;m not sure what you will be trying to heal up but collagen/glycine is often recommended after an injury due to some recent positive results:</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>Not related to diet, but also look into wet/moist wound healing for reduction in scar tissue. </p>

<p>I personally supplement with zinc, E, C, D, iron when I get hurt, but not sure if it really helps in comparison to my overall healthy diet. But, I know a lot about wet healing after using some colloidal bandage to heal some gnarly road rash super quickly. A friendly biker lent me some bandages and of course, I had to look into the science of it (conventional wisdom tells you to let wounds breath, after all). Also re-attached part of my toe using the same methods. Minimal pain. No scars. Dunno what your surgeons plan on dressing you with, or what their recommendations were for aftercare but thought I&#39;d mention! </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3842869/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3842869/</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>So I have no clue if it’s good for wound healing, but I take AREDS 2 vitamins (helps prevents macular degeneration) and those suckers have 80mcg (mg?) of zinc in them.  Lots of people take it.  It also has 2mcg (mg?) of copper to offset copper deficiency since they both compete for uptake in the body.  Anyways, it won’t hurt you, it can only benefit you as long as you balance it with copper.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I used E on my surgical lacerations and kept them bandaged.  They’re nearly invisible.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>interesting, where did you learn of this trick?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Well I learned of the Vitamin E from a friend. The bandage part was just through trial and error over the years.   I have very pale skin, and have a few allergies that result in hives and contact dermatitis.  I started bandaging them to stop myself from scratching them. They tend to be most itchy once I’ve broken the skin and they scab over.  If I kept them open to the air, they would heal faster, but result in a scar or an ugly mark that would take forever to fade. When I bandaged them they would take longer to heal, but heal in a way that was much more cosmetically aesthetic.  So to answer your question, I learned from trial and error, and also the advice of a friend.</p>

<p>The first installment in this series will deal with the history of iodine from discovery to essentiality, covering a
period of 100 years. The discovery of the stable halides,
chloride, iodide, bromide and fluoride seems to have
been a French enterprise. All 4 halides were identified
by French scientists, (Table I) with H. Davy from Great
Britain, sharing the discovery of chloride with GayLussac in 1809-1810.4,14</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Only eight years after the discovery of iodine from seaweed, a Swiss physician, J.F. Coindet who previously
used burnt sponge and seaweed successfully for the
treatment of goiter, reasoned that iodine could be the
active ingredient in seaweed. In 1819, he tested tincture
of iodine at 250 mg/day, in 150 goiter patients with great
success. He could reduce significantly the size of goiter
within a week. He published his results in 1820. 15 </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>By the time Bauman identified large concentrations of
iodine in the thyroid gland in 1895, pharmaceutical and
apothecary preparations containing iodine, excluding
thyroid extracts, were widely used as a panacea for all
human ills. To quote Kelley 22:</p>

<p>“In the first flush of enthusiasm for the newcomer, physicians and surgeons tested it and tried it for every conceivable pathological condition. The variety of diseases
for which iodine was prescribed in the early years in astonishing – <strong>paralysis., chorea, scrofula, lacrimal fistula,
deafness, distortions of the spine, hip-joint disease,
syphilis, acute inflammation, gout, gangrene, dropsy,
carbuncles, whitlow, chilblains, burns, scalds, lupus,
croup, catarrh, asthma, ulcers, and bronchitis – to mention only a few.</strong> Indeed, tincture of iodine, iodoform, or
one of the iodides, was applied to almost every case that
resisted the ordinary routine of practice; and between
1820 and 1840 there appeared a remarkable series of
essays and monographs testifying to the extraordinary
benefits to be achieved by this new and potent remedy.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these monographs disappeared from U.S.
medical libraries. It is now very difficult to review the
true history of iodine in medicine in extenso without access to these publications. Some 50 years ago, Nobel
laureate Albert Szent Györgyi, the physician who discovered Vitamin C in 1928 and who was a medical student in the early 1900’s, wrote 23:</p>

<p><strong>“When I was a medical student, iodine in the form of KI was the universal medicine. Nobody knew what it did, but it did something and did something good. We students used to sum up the situation in this little rhyme: 
If ye don’t know where, what, and why Prescribe ye then K and I.</strong> </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The phenomenal growth of iodine containing products,
from 10 preparations listed in the pharmacopoeias in 
1851 to 1,700 approved pharmacopoeial names assigned
to iodine-containing products in 1956, is compelling evidence for the widespread applications of iodine in medicine 22: </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>By the early 1900s iodine was well-established in medical and surgical practices, as described in the Encyclopedia Britannica 11th Edition published in 1910-1911.24 In Volume XIV, under iodine, on pages 725-726, one reads: “In medicine iodine is frequently applied externally as a counterirritant, having powerful antiseptic properties. <strong>In the form of certain salts iodine is very widely used, for internal administration in medicine and in the treatment of many conditions usually classed as surgical, such as the bone manifestations of tertiary syphilis.</strong> The most commonly used salt is the iodide of potassium; the iodides of sodium and ammonium are almost as frequently employed, and those of calcium and strontium are in occasional use. The usual doses of these salts are from five to thirty grains or more. [Author’s note: For the reader’s information, one grain is approximately 60 mg. <strong>Therefore, the daily therapeutic dose was from 300-1,800 mg iodide]</strong>. Their pharmacological action is as obscure as their effects in certain diseased conditions are consistently brilliant and unexampled. Our ignorance of their mode of action is cloaked by the term deobstruent, which implies that they possess the power of driving out impurities from the blood and tissues. Most notably is this the case with the poisonous products of syphilis. In its tertiary stages — and also earlier — this disease yields in the most rapid and unmistakable fashion to iodides; so much so that the administration of these salts is at present [Author’s note: For the reader’s information, this was written in early 1900.] the best means of determining whether, for instance, a cranial tumour be syphilitic or not. <strong>No surgeon would think of operating on such a case until iodides had been freely administered and, by failing to cure, had proved the disease to be non-syphilitic.</strong> Another instance of the deobstruent power — ‘alterative,’ it was formerly termed — is seen in the case of chronic lead poisoning. The essential part of the medicinal treatment of this condition is the administration of iodides, which are able to decompose the insoluble albuminates of lead which have become locked up in the tissues, rapidly causing their degeneration, and to cause the excretion of the poisonous metal by means of the intestine and the kidneys. <strong>The following is a list of the principal conditions in which iodides are recognized to be of definite value: metallic poisonings, as by lead and mercury, asthma, aneurism, arteriosclerosis, angina pectoris, gout, goiter, syphilis, haemophilia, Bright’s disease (nephritis), and bronchitis.”</strong></p>

<p>In a monograph published in 1940 by Harvard University Press, reviewing the history of iodine in medicine with 588 references, the author, <strong>William Thomas Salter 25 expressed his amazement at the surprisingly good results obtained with iodide in tertiary luetic (i.e., syphilitic) lesions and arteriosclerosis using daily amounts of grams of iodide for long periods of time and without any evidence of complications.</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In the early 1900s, Professor Kocher came on the scene and had an adverse iodophobic effect on the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Professor Theodore Kocher carried a lot of weight, being the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1909 for his work on thyroid surgery, the only Nobel Prize assigned to research on the thyroid gland. The year after Kocher received the Nobel prize, he reported that he suffered from hyperthyroidism following ingestion of iodide. Kocher then became the most famous medicoiodophobe in medical history. He was against the use of iodine/iodide for all forms of hyperthyroidism.4</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Kocher’s influence divided the clinicians into two groups: the iodine group who favored the use of iodine preparations first in hyperthyroidism, referring the patient for x-ray or surgery only if non-responsive; and the surgical school, discouraging the use of iodine and recommending surgery exclusively for hyperthyroidism. Kocher’s influence crossed the Atlantic Ocean, as reported by Redisch and Perloff: “The conception that treatment of Graves’ disease … is primarily surgical, is widespread despite the fact that American, as well as European, literature contains numerous reports of satisfactory results with non-surgical treatment in selected cases.”26</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>Using iodine alone in patients with hyperthyroidism, Thompson, et al,27 reported in 1930, a success rate of 88% and Starr, et al,28 in 1924, reported a success rate of 92% with Lugol solution at daily doses of 6-90 mg.</strong></p>

<p>During the first 100 years following the discovery of iodine, its clinical applications were purely empirical, and the effective dose was arrived at by trial and error. The concept of essential trace elements was not yet established. In 1911, Gabriel Bertrand (1867-1962) proposed the concept of essential trace elements, necessary for normal growth and functions of plants, following a series of publications in the Comptes Rendus de L’Académie des Sciences published between 1894 and 1911.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Marine chose a population of adolescent school girls from 5th-12th grade between the ages of 10 and 18 years residing in Akron, Ohio, a city with a 56% incidence of goiter.29,30 His choice was based on the observation that the incidence of goiter was highest at puberty, and six times more common in girls than in boys.30 He studied two groups of pupils devoid of goiter (thyroid enlargement by palpation) at the beginning of the project. The control group consisted of 2,305 pupils who did not receive iodide supplementation; and 2,190 pupils received a total of 4 g of sodium iodide per year for a period of 2.5 years. The amount of iodide was spread out in two doses of 2 g each during the spring and the fall. <strong>This 2-gram dose was administered in daily amounts of 0.2 g of sodium iodide over 10 days. At 4,000 mg of sodium iodide per 365 days, the average daily amount of sodium iodide was 12 mg, equivalent to 9 mg iodide, 60 times the RDA.</strong></p>

<p>After 2.5 years of observation, 495 pupils in the control group developed thyroid enlargement (22%). Only five cases of goiter occurred in the iodine-supplementation group (0.2%). <strong>Iodism was observed in 0.5%</strong> of the pupils receiving iodide supplementation.</p>

<p>The implementation of iodization of table salt in the US was associated with the appearance of autoimmune thyroiditis. In several communities worldwide, an increased incidence of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis was reported following implementation of iodization of sodium chloride.32 In areas of the US where this relationship has been studied, mainly in the Great Lakes region, a similar trend was reported. In 1966 and 1968, Weaver, et al,33,34 from Ann Arbor Michigan reported: “The salient histopathological feature of the thyroid glands, removed at operation in a five-year period before iodine prophylaxis (1915-1920), was the paucity of lymphocytes in their parenchyma, and, more importantly, the absence of thyroiditis of any form ... It should be emphasized that the thyroid glands prior to the use of iodized salt were devoid of lymphocytes, and nodular colloid goiters with dense lymphocytic infiltrates were found after the introduction of iodized salt in 1924.”</p>

<p><strong>It is of interest to note that prior to iodization of salt, autoimmune thyroiditis was almost non-existent in the US, although Lugol solution and potassium iodide were used extensively in medical practice in amounts two orders of magnitude greater than the average daily amount ingested from iodized salt. This suggests that inadequate iodide intake aggravated by goitrogens, not excess iodide, was the cause of this condition.2 Of interest is the fact that autoimmune thyroiditis cannot be induced by inorganic iodide in laboratory animals unless combined with goitrogens, therefore inducing iodine deficiency.</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In 1912, pathologist H. Hashimoto36 published his histological findings in four thyroid glands removed at surgery: numerous lymphoid follicles; extensive connective tissue formation; diffuse round cell infiltration; and significant changes of the acinar epithelium. He called this pathology of the thyroid struma lymphomatosa. This condition became known as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. At the time of his publication in 1912, autoimmune thyroiditis was not observed in the US population until the iodization of salt. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is now classified as goitrous autoimmune thyroiditis because the gland is enlarged, in distinction to atrophic autoimmune thyroiditis where atrophy and fibrosis are predominant. Both conditions are chronic, progressing over time to hypothyroidism in a significant percentage of patients.4 Both conditions improved following a complete nutritional program emphasizing magnesium combined with iodine supplementation for whole body sufficiency.4</p>

<p><strong>Further evidence that iodine deficiency, not excess, is the cause of autoimmune thyroiditis follows.</strong> Experimentally induced autoimmune thyroiditis in laboratory animals by acutely administered iodide required the use of antithyroid drugs, essentially goitrogens, to produce these effects. These goitrogens induced thyroid hyperplasia and iodide deficiency. Antioxidants either reduced or prevented the acute iodide-induced thyroiditis in chicks and mice. <strong>Bagchi, et al, and Many, et al, proposed that the thyroid injury induced by the combined use of iodide and goitrogens occurs through the generation of reactive oxygen species.</strong> (See reference 4 for review.)</p>

<p>A proposed mechanism by the author for the oxidative damage caused by low levels of iodide combined with antithyroid drugs is that inadequate iodide supply to the thyroid gland, aggravated by goitrogens, activates the thyroid peroxydase (TPO) system through elevated TSH, low levels of iodinated lipids, and high cytosolic free calcium, resulting in excess production of H2O2. The excess H2O2 production is evidenced by the fact that antioxidants used in Bagchi’s experiments did not interfere with the oxidation and organification of iodide and therefore neutralized only the excess oxidant. This H2O2 production is above normal due to a deficient feedback system caused by high cytosolic calcium due to magnesium deficiency and low levels of iodinated lipids which require for their synthesis iodide levels two orders of magnitude greater than the RDA for iodine.4</p>

<p>Once the low iodide supply is depleted, TPO in the presence of H2O2 and organic substrate reverts to its peroxydase function which is the primary function of haloperoxydases, causing oxidative damage to molecules nearest to the site of action — TPO and the substrate thyroglobulin (Tg).

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>“Background
Previous findings on the association of dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) with mortality are conflicting.</p>

<p>Objectives
The aim of this study was to summarize earlier findings on the association between dietary GI and GL and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality.</p>

<p>Methods
A comprehensive literature search was performed of electronic databases, including MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, and Google scholar, up to September 2018. Prospective cohort studies that reported GI and GL as the exposure and all-cause or CVD mortality as the outcome were included in the analysis. The random-effects model was used to estimate pooled RR and 95% CIs of all-cause and CVD mortality.</p>

<p>Results
Eighteen cohort studies with a total of 251,497 participants, reporting 14,774 cases of all-cause mortality and 3658 cases of CVD mortality, were included in the present analysis. No significant association was found between dietary GI and all-cause mortality (RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.19) and CVD mortality (RR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.87, 1.20). In addition, dietary GL was not associated with all-cause mortality (RR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.27) or CVD mortality (RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.25). However, the highest dietary GI, in comparison to the lowest one, significantly increased the risk of all-cause mortality in women (RR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.35). No evidence for a nonlinear association between dietary GI or GL and all-cause and CVD mortality was found (P &gt; 0.05).</p>

<p>Conclusions
This meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies showed no significant association between either dietary GI or GL and all-cause and CVD mortality in men, but a positive association of GI with all-cause mortality in women.”</p>

<div class="md"><p>So... if carbs aren&#39;t bad and fats aren&#39;t bad... is it the proteins that are killing us?  </p>

<p>Is the air we breath truly toxic? Is the water really turning the frogs gay?   </p>

<p>Jokes aside, what in the hell is causing disease and issues then? We see people on carnivore healing themselves, while likewise seeing people on vegetarian diets healing themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So... if carbs aren&#39;t bad and fats aren&#39;t bad... is it the proteins that are killing us?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some carbs are worse than others and some fats are worse than others but the true disfunction almost always occurs in the context of <em>excess calories</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>No health organization has ever said all fats are bad and all health organizations recommend limiting saturated fat. I see no reason why we shouldn’t start with the number one cause of death, heart disease, especially considering it’s most often considered a preventable disease. </p>

<p>Some people like to say sugar causes heart disease and while hyperglycemia is certainly one of many causes of endothelial dysfunction it’s not an issue in people that are insulin sensitive. Things you can do to maintain insulin sensitivity include maintaining a healthy weight, limiting saturated fats, limiting total fat to &lt;35% of energy intake, getting adequate sleep, being physically active, reducing sedentary behavior, etc. There are many other causes of endothelial dysfunction, including the unavoidable process of aging.</p>

<p>The reason why endothelial dysfunction matters is it allows LDL to enter the sub intima where it can become oxidized and eventual become a plaque. While we can’t completely avoid endothelial dysfunction we can keep cholesterol levels low enough to not only prevent atherosclerosis but even reverse it. I think reversing atherosclerosis is important considering to 80% of people already have gross evidence of coronary atherosclerosis by their mid 20s. It’s a slow progressive disease that starts in childhood, or even infancy for those born to overweight mothers, but doesn’t manifest into overt symptoms until much later in life. Most wait until the symptoms are overt but an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you wait until your first cardiac event or until you suffer from erectile dysfunction you have already accumulated decades of damage and lost significant quality of life. </p>

<p>I think people make nutrition seem far more confusing than it has to be. Getting into the details is interesting for some of us but the average person doesn’t care about the minutia. We already know enough to prevent or even reverse most major diseases: maintain a healthy weight, keep cholesterol levels low, maintain your insulin sensitivity, and eat a varied nutrient dense diet along with the other healthy lifestyle practices (stay physically active, reduce sedentary behavior, keep stress low, sleep well, don’t smoke, etc). </p>

<p>You might be able to lose weight on a carnivore diet which will improve many aspects of health but you will not be able to maintain the cholesterol levels needed to prevent and reverse atherosclerosis / heart disease. And as I said before up to 80% of people by their mid 20s already have gross evidence of this disease making reversal a priority imo.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Part of it:  <a href="https://acestoohigh.com/aces-101/">https://acestoohigh.com/aces-101/</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yes, and it&#39;s an open question why suddenly and abruptly, people started eating far more calories.  Were they less satiated?  Was the food that they ate less filling?  Did the food they ate somehow impact how their body metabolized it, say storing vs using for energy, and so leaving the person hungry sooner?  Snacking suddenly became the thing adults did and needed, vs something for children.  </p>

<p>There was a recent study posted here were on isocaloric diets in a metabolic ward, people gained weight on the processed diet and lost it on the unprocessed diet.  The primary difference seemed to be fiber in the food or fiber as a drink.  But people in the 1950s had Wonder Bread, so it&#39;s not like they were chowing down on whole meal Ezekiel&#39;s. </p>

<p>This meta-analysis looked at papers studying GI and GL, which are associated with carbs high or low in fiber, and found no effect for the most part.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>can you give us some knowledge about atherosclerosis reversal? at which levels does this happen? it&#39;s the HDL:LDL ratio or something?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s becoming more and more likely that diet is a minor component to health. Outside of oxidized PUFAs and sugars, it seems like stress, sleep deprivation, alcohol consumption, cigarette use, and even loneliness is more responsible for negative health outcomes then diet. </p>

<p>I think if we are going to continue to use epidemiology as a basis for so many conclusions, we need to increase the strength of association from which to derive causality, we might end up with much less funding in the field of nutrition.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>why suddenly and abruptly, people started eating far more calories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well there are many reasons but I would say the two biggest are availability and price.  Calories used to be expensive and scarce and now they are sold in nearly every store at 100&#39;s of calories per dollar.  And since those calories are quite often low in fiber and protein and high in salt and sugar, it&#39;s pretty easy to chow down on a 1000 calorie &#39;snack&#39; and not even notice the consumption.  Add that to the fact that tasty food creates a hefty dopamine response and the addiction potential is also clear.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The metabolic ward study that I think you are referring to was not isocaloric. The people in both arms of the study were offered food with the same number of calories and macro breakdowns, however, they could eat as much food as they wanted. The people in the processed food arm of the study ate more of the offered food and consumed more calories in total. (They also consumed the food faster.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-study-finds-heavily-processed-foods-cause-overeating-weight-gain">https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-study-finds-heavily-processed-foods-cause-overeating-weight-gain</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>HDL:LDL has never been shown to reverse atherosclerosis to my knowledge. In order to reverse atherosclerosis you need to aggressively lower cholesterol levels, typically total cholesterol &lt;150 and LDL &lt;70mg/dL. This can be achieved with lipid lowering medication, diet (low saturated fat / dietary cholesterol and higher fiber) and lifestyle changes or a combination of the two.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Can you say more about that?  It sounds basically believable but I&#39;m wondering a couple things.  One is whether there are any papers directly outlining what you talk about with effect sizes from stress, sleep, alcohol etc. maybe being larger than diet - is that something that there&#39;s published work on or just that you have to put together from separate sources?  </p>

<p>The other is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think if we are going to continue to use epidemiology as a basis for so many conclusions, we need to increase the strength of association from which to derive causality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... meaning the evidence base needs to be stronger within nutrition, outside of it or both?  I&#39;m not in the field but it seems like the conclusion makes sense that from what I&#39;ve seen a lot of epidemiological data that&#39;s used as if it shows causality hasn&#39;t been very rigorously analyzed in that way.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I tend to think humanity is going through a nutrition phase right now. In the end though, nutrition probably won&#39;t solve 90% of the problems we hoped it would solve.</p>

<p>This is what makes it hard to give advice to my unhealthy friends. They want to know what foods to eat or not eat, but health is really a pattern of living. There&#39;s no quick fix for bad health. You have to change a lot of things.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right -- it&#39;s even in the paper title and I missed it.  The language is confusing.  What does &quot;The ultra-processed and unprocessed meals had the <em>same amounts</em> of  calories, sugars, fiber, fat, and carbohydrates, and participants could  eat as much or as little as they wanted.&quot; even mean?</p>

<p>Ah, found it.  &quot; The meals plus snacks were pro-vided at an amount equivalent to twice each subject’s estimated energy requirements for weight maintenance as calculated by1.63resting energy expenditure measured at screening. &quot;</p>

<p>So they offered <em>TWICE the energy requirement worth of food</em>.  Twice!  It makes the study even more interesting that when presented with more food than they could ever eat, if it wasn&#39;t highly processed, the whole &#39;intuitive eating&#39; thing apparently works (when confined to a metabolic ward and with the food choices made by someone else *cough*). </p>

<p>People ate what they needed, and even lost weight they had gained from the ultra processed diet.  <em>Spontaneously</em>, without measuring or weighing or making sure they used the standard 1 cup measurement tool.</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing that out, I had puzzled over the wording and now the study is even more interesting.  The food choice differences 1960 to 2010 are largely, IMO, less or more processed food.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>For your second question:
I was in a good discussion with someone else on this subreddit over here:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bsvlwn/research_gaps_in_evaluating_the_relationship_of_meat_and_health/eor2aly/?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bsvlwn/research_gaps_in_evaluating_the_relationship_of_meat_and_health/eor2aly/?context=3</a></p>

<p>Basically in nutrition, for whatever reason (probably so there are more publishable results and funding), you don&#39;t need to have your variables be as strongly associated with one another to establish causality, as you would in other fields of epidemiology. Normally the rate ratio has to be over 1.5 to at least be moderate, with lower RRs being barely worth a mention. Since it has become the norm to use &lt;1.5 RRs in nutrition and have their findings pushed in the media and academic circles alike, this opens the door to random results looking significant, masking flawed methodologies, and ignoring confounding factors.</p>

<p>If we required a stronger strength of association before making connections between diet and health outcome, we wouldn&#39;t have 80% of all foods causing/curing cancer (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23193004">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23193004</a>). We would probably end up with much less sensational nutrition headlines, but have in their place, solid proven nutrition advice. Real deficiencies that cause provable effects on a significant portion of the first world like iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc, and more, as well as avoidance of sugar and oxidized PUFAs, would be taken more seriously, rather than sexy and sensationalist headline about how X food might prevent/cause Y.</p>

<p>For your first question: Here is a good paper on how a sense of purpose and involvement within the community is common in Southern Italy:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29229012">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29229012</a></p>

<p>Sardinia:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5867483/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5867483/</a></p>

<p>And the Okinawans embrace the concept of &quot;Ikigai&quot; which also has their elderly actively involved in the life of their community.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Although they were offered food with the same macro content, they ate more fat, more sugar, less protein and less fiber on the ultra-processed diet. (Undoubtedly more salt, too). They ate faster because they picked out the soft, easily chewed, rapidly dissolving, energy-dense choices. Less processed food didn&#39;t allow access to concentrated fats or sugars and slowed intake to give them more time to respond to hunger cues.</p>

<p>Of course, this is another nail in the coffin of the insulin-carbohydrate theory of obesity. The ultra-processed food was overeaten well before insulin levels began to rise in response!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/Perrycardium/status/1136623054476533760">this thread</a> on twitter the other day.</p>

<p>It would seem all those statisticians don&#39;t necesseraly agree with the idea that RR &lt; 1.5 are meaningless. </p>

<p>Here are some responses </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The “zone of potential bias” is problematic. Biologically plausible and clinically meaningful relative risks are often in this range. In fact, RRs of 2,3,4 are implausible in many cases.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes! Especially for nutrition or public health interventions, where large populations are exposed, small RRs can translate into large population attributable risks.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>This rule-of-thumb stuff is silly. RR=4 can be biased, and RR=1.2 can have very significant public health consequences.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Surely they’ve got this the other way around. If I got an OR of ~5 I would check my code and would then think my study was underpowered</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not helpful as it suggests that the only bias is magnitude bias. Also, ORs/RRs that are 10+/0.1 can be biased (most of the time it is biologically/clinically implausible to have such a large effect)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no reason to believe a small point estimate indicates &quot;bias&quot;! A small effect may be indistinguishable from no effect, but that depends on precision, not just the point estimate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Someone in the comment linked to <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h1551">this meta-analysis</a> about smoking vs CHD risk </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Random effects meta-analysis of the association of smoking status with cardiovascular mortality yielded a summary hazard ratio of 2.07 (95% CI 1.82 to 2.36) for current smokers and 1.37 (1.25 to 1.49) for former smokers compared with never smokers. Corresponding summary estimates for risk advancement periods were 5.50 years (4.25 to 6.75) for current smokers and 2.16 years (1.38 to 2.39) for former smokers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So RR of 2.07 for current smoker and 1.37 for former smoker. </p>

<p><a href="/u/Triabolical_">/u/Triabolical_</a> , what are your sources for the idea that RR &lt; 1.5 are very likely to be confounded?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Not quite matched for macros.  There was almost no fiber in the food they ate on the processed diet, they got a &quot;fiber drink&quot; to make the numbers line up.  Meaning the numbers match if you only look at numbers, but a fiber drink vs veggies seems like a big deal.</p>

<p>It&#39;s too short term to be about the valid insulin-carbohydrate theory of obesity.  I mean, they ate more refined carbs right?  Which we know spikes BG and insulin more than the fiber-containing whole foods in the unprocessed diet.</p>

<p>&quot;After the unprocessed diet, fasting glucose and insulin levels tended to decrease compared to base-line,and the homeostasis model assessment of insulinresistance(HOMA-IR) (Matthews et al., 1985) was significantly decreased compared to baseline. There were no significant differences in HOMA-IR after the ultra-processed diet as compared to either baseline or the unprocessed diet.&quot;</p>

<p>Imagine the outcome 2 years into the ultraprocessed diet.  High insulin and obesity.</p>

<p>Regarding protein, they did not eat less protein!  &quot;The remarkable stability of absolute protein intake between the diets, along with the slight reduction in overall protein provided in the ultra-processed versus the unprocessed diet (14% versus15.6% of calories, respectively) (Table 1), suggests that the pro-tein leverage hypothesis could partially explain the increase in energy intake with the ultra-processed diet in an attempt to maintain a constant protein intake (Martı ́nez Steele et al., 2018;Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2005).&quot;</p>

<p>The ultraprocessed diet was slightly lower in protein, and one theory is that the subjects overate &quot;food&quot; in attempts to get enough protein.  Maybe for satiety, though he thinks the body drove it to secure protein as a macro, and I&#39;m unsure we have studies backing up that behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>RR of observational studies specifically.</p>

<p>The actual number is somewhat arbitrary, but here&#39;s why I think that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The results of many studies with low RR oscillate back and forth. Are eggs bad, or good? Is red meat bad, or good?</p></li>
<li><p>The size of the results coming from many studies are biologically unlikely. Read Ioannidis on this subject; here&#39;s a good starting point: <a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Ioannidis-2013-nutrition-bmj.pdf">http://www.dcscience.net/Ioannidis-2013-nutrition-bmj.pdf</a></p></li>
<li><p>The nutritional data that feeds into these studies is known to be seriously flawed. There is recall error and deliberate bias on the part of the subjects. One cannot get precise results from imprecise data. </p></li>
<li><p>The history of replication of observational studies is poor. I couldn&#39;t find the study with a quick search, but there was a study that looked at 39 different results from observational studies and compared them to RCTs that tested the same studies. None of them replicated and 3 gave a statistically significant opposite result.</p></li>
<li><p>Health user effect is a huge confounder and likely impossible to fully correct for. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s a simple matter of signal to noise ratio. Smoking and lung cancer was easy (risk ratios in the range of 9-30) because the effect was so strong the confounders didn&#39;t matter. Smoking and CVD was harder, but still had risk ratios of about 2.</p>

<p>Many of the observational studies are down below 1.3. Such low risk ratios could easily be swamped by confounders. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an overview article with some links:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.acsh.org/news/2018/08/24/john-ioannidis-aims-his-bazooka-nutrition-science-13357">https://www.acsh.org/news/2018/08/24/john-ioannidis-aims-his-bazooka-nutrition-science-13357</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yes this thread was about cohort and case-control study, so observational studies. </p>

<p>Your points are all valid concern about the validity of observational studies result, but I don&#39;t think they justify using RR &lt; 1.5 as a cutoff point to decide wether results are valid or not. As said in that thread, with a sample size large enough small RR can still be meaningful, and small effect does not = biased effect per default. Healthy user effect and tools such as FFQs can biased the precision of the result, but I think this is mixing up two different things. Small RR can still be meaningful if the precision of the measure is adequate, as said in the comment, so I think caution is warranted when creating random cutoff points like this.  </p>

<p>Honestly I&#39;ve only had an introductionary research stats course as part of my master degree and stats can get very complicated very fast, so I cannot judge the validity of this claim correctly, but I&#39;m under the impression that it is not accurate from a stats point of view to declare all RR &lt; 1.5 as pretty much useless. It seem that it can be perfectly fine as long as the study methodology and design is strong enough. </p>

<p>May I ask what is your statistic background?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

It seem that it can be perfectly fine as long as the study methodology and design is strong enough. </p>

<p>To be clear, I don&#39;t use 1.5 as a cutoff to where I think above that is valid (or causal). I use it as a region where I think that there is enough of an effect that the hypothesis gets interesting, but that also depends on the quality of the study.</p>

<p>For observational studies, you start with data that is seriously confounded. And then you try to adjust the results to eliminate confounders, based on the data that you have on the confounders that you think are important. </p>

<p>And you get a result. Is it meaningful? Well, it depends...</p>

<p>You may have made better or worse choices of confounders to correct for, because of the data you have available, your skill in understanding what confounders are likely to be important, and your wish to show a significant effect. This is a significant issue in study design.</p>

<p>The data on most confounding variables is inherently imprecise in most cases. You can correct for whether somebody had diabetes or not, but there are different severeties of diabetes and that might be significant. That can skew your result.</p>

<p>And finally, there are always hidden/residual confounders that you don&#39;t know about and therefore cannot correct for. </p>

<p>So, you&#39;ve gotten a result. It is absolutely assured that the result you get is biased by the lack of perfection in the confounding corrections and the confounders that we could not correct for.  That is inherently why the papers that describe all observational results talk about association rather than causality.</p>

<p>But then we have a practical question.</p>

<p>Is the result due to the thing we are actually studying or is it due to residual confounding that correlates with the thing we are studying?</p>

<p>The residual confounding would create a risk ratio all by itself even if there was no effect. We don&#39;t know how big that biased risk ratio is nor which direction it is pushing the risk ratio we measured. But we do know that it would take a much larger amount of bias to push our measured 0.9 RR to a 2.0 RR than it would take to push a 0.9 RR to a 1.1 RR. </p>

<p>You will find researchers talking about effects with RR of 1.2 as if they are causal, and it&#39;s worse when the media gets a hold of the results. There seems to be a lot of belief that advanced statistical manipulations can somehow fix issues that are inherent in observational studies and more than a little wishful thinking. </p>

<p>You inherently need to have some sort of bar where results are worth a closer look. For me, it&#39;s around 1.5 for a good-quality study.</p>

At the same time, nutrient-sensing pathways can respond to acute nutrient imbalance and modulate and orient metabolism so cells can adapt optimally to a declining or increasing availability of nutrients. Organismal circadian rhythms are coordinated by behavioral rhythms such as activity–rest and feeding–fasting cycles to temporally orchestrate a sequence of physiological processes to optimize metabolism. Basic research in circadian rhythms has largely focused on the functioning of the self-sustaining molecular circadian oscillator, while research in nutrition science has yielded insights into physiological responses to caloric deprivation or to specific macronutrients. Integration of these two fields into actionable new concepts in the timing of food intake has led to the emerging practice of time-restricted eating. In this paradigm, daily caloric intake is restricted to a consistent window of 8–12 h. This paradigm has pervasive benefits on multiple organ systems.”</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>  </p>

<p>The consumption of mineral waters is increasing in industrialised countries. High intakes of Ca and other alkalising cations as well as a low acid intake are beneficial to bone. We examined which components of mineral waters are conditioning their Ca content and their alkalinising power, in order to define the optimal profile. European mineral waters were randomly selected on the Internet: 100 waters with less than 200 mg Ca/l (9·98 mEq/l) and fifty with more than 200 mg/l, all with complete data for SO4, P, Cl, Na, K, Mg and Ca, and most also for HCO3. For comparison, forty North American mineral waters were randomly chosen. The potential renal acid load (PRAL) was calculated for each mineral water. North American waters did not reveal significant results because of their low mineralisation. We performed correlations between all eight components in order to explore the properties of the mineral waters. In the European waters, twenty-six out of twenty-eight correlations showed a <em>P</em> value of ≤ 0·01. In waters with PRAL &gt;0 (acidifying waters), PRAL was positively correlated with SO4, Ca, K and Mg (<em>P</em> &lt; 0·001). In those with PRAL &lt; 0 (alkalinising waters), PRAL was negatively correlated with HCO3, Na, Mg, Ca, K, Cl and SO4 (<em>P</em> &lt; 0·001). SO4 and HCO3were not found together in high quantities in the same water for geochemical reasons. A high Ca content is associated with either a high SO4 or a high HCO3 content. SO4 theoretically increases Ca excretion, while HCO3 and low PRAL values are associated with positive effects on bone. Therefore, the best waters for bone health are rich in both HCO3 and Ca, and by consequence low in SO4.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Is this a good thing for people that consume dairy?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the relation between habitual milk and dairy consumption and brain morphology as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigations in 119 young healthy university students. MRI measurements were performed on a Siemens Magnetom Trio Tim (3T) system while FreeSurfer software suite was used for volumetric segmentation. Dietary habits related to milk and dairy consumption were assessed by a structured questionnaire. Total cerebral cortex, total cerebral white matter, and total cerebral parenchyma were significantly related with cottage cheese and total protein intake from milk and dairy also when controlled for age and gender in the multivariate model. Our results indicate that dietary habits related with milk and dairy are proportionally associated with volumes of both cerebral cortex and cerebral white matter.</p>

<div class="md"><p>At work can’t read the study fully, can I get a TLDR?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I am utterly (or udderly confused hehe) confused about this outcome. Is more white matter a good thing when it comes to a healthy brain or does it leave it more prone to neurological disease? Would anyone break this down for the confused? I would greatly appreciate the explanation.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Makes a bit of sense when you consider that calves would benefit from milk causing their brains to grow in the period right after they are born. Just like the natural growth hormones present in milk.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>[removed]</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The researchers don&#39;t know if a larger brain is a good thing or not, they explain that it seems better except people with autism can have usually large brains.  It&#39;s a study showing an interesting correlation, and they recommend more research.</p>

<p>These were all uni students but it only controlled for age and gender (not BMI I don&#39;t think). </p>

<p>It would make sense that protein in milk results in more growth.  And the brain is mostly fat/cholesterol and protein with all the neural tissue.  It&#39;s like a quarter of all of your cholesterol in your body.</p>

<p>It might be that either too much or too little could be bad, but it&#39;s unclear from anything in this thread so far.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not entirely clear.  From the discussion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Generally,  larger  brain  is  regarded  as  a  positive  rather  than negative  feature  (e.g.  Witelson  et al.,  2006).  At  the  same  time, autistic  children  (Hazlett  et al.,  2011)  and  patients  with  schizophrenia  (Bassett  et al.,  1996)  have  been  reported  to  have  larger head  circumference  than  age-matched  controls  and  brain  over-growth has been implicated in the pathology of these conditions (Hazlett   et al.,   2011).   It   is   of   importance   too,   that   dietary interventions in autism rely on eliminating milk and dairy besides gluten containing foods (Elder, 2008).</p>

<p>In   our   previous   study,   intracranial   volume   was   inversely related with vitamin D (Plo ́zer et al., 2014), the low serum level of which is a correlate or predictor of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions (Balion et al., 2012; Evatt et al., 2008; Hollo ́et al.,  2014).  Vitamin  D  deficiency  has  been  shown  to promote  cellular  proliferation  in  the  nervous  system  (Ko  et al., 2004).  Vitamin  D  is  also  implicated  in  the  mTOR  signaling  by suppressing  its  activity  (Lisse  &amp;  Hewison,  2011).  It  seems  that higher milk consumption and low level of vitamin D, converge inactivating a common signaling pathway, and both are associated with tissue growth (Ko et al., 2004; Melnik et al., 2012) and larger brain volume as indicated by our previous (Plo ́zer et al., 2014) and present data.</p>

<p>Our  results  indicate  that  dietary habits related  with  milk and dairy are proportionally associated with volumes of both cerebral cortex and cerebral white matter. Functional consequence of milk-and  dairy-associated  growth  in  brain  parenchyma  remains  to  be elucidated.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>“Question  Does a model considering the features of individuals predict the glycemic responses to food better than models based on the calorie or carbohydrate content?</p>

<p>Findings  In this cohort study using a personalized predictive model among 327 participants without diabetes, glycemic responses to food varied significantly across the cohort. Observed postprandial glycemic responses showed higher correlation with values predicted by the model taking into consideration the features of individuals than with the calorie and carbohydrate content of the meals.</p>

<p>Meaning  A personalized predictive model that takes into consideration unique features of an individual in addition to food characteristics may allow individuals to better manage their glycemic responses to food consumed.</p>

<p>Abstract
Importance  Emerging evidence suggests that postprandial glycemic responses (PPGRs) to food may be influenced by and predicted according to characteristics unique to each individual, including anthropometric and microbiome variables. Interindividual diversity in PPGRs to food requires a personalized approach for the maintenance of healthy glycemic levels.</p>

<p>Objectives  To describe and predict the glycemic responses of individuals to a diverse array of foods using a model that considers the physiology and microbiome of the individual in addition to the characteristics of the foods consumed.</p>

<p>Design, Setting, and Participants  This cohort study using a personalized predictive model enrolled 327 individuals without diabetes from October 11, 2016, to December 13, 2017, in Minnesota and Florida to be part of a study lasting 6 days. The study measured anthropometric variables, described the gut microbial composition, and assessed blood glucose levels every 5 minutes using a continuous glucose monitor. Participants logged their food and activity information for the duration of the study. A predictive model of individualized PPGRs to a diverse array of foods was trained and applied.</p>

<p>Main Outcomes and Measures  Glycemic responses to food consumed over 6 days for each participant. The predictive model of personalized PPGRs considered individual features, including the microbiome, in addition to the features of the foods consumed.</p>

<p>Results  Postprandial response to the same foods varied across 327 individuals (mean [SD] age, 45 [12] years; 78.0% female). A model predicting each individual’s responses to food that considers several individual factors in addition to food features had better overall performance (R = 0.62) than current standard-of-care approaches using nutritional content alone (R = 0.34 for calories and R = 0.40 for carbohydrates) to control postprandial glycemic levels.</p>

<p>Conclusions and Relevance  Across the cohort of adults without diabetes who were examined, a personalized predictive model that considers unique features of the individual, such as clinical characteristics, physiological variables, and the microbiome, in addition to nutrient content was more predictive than current dietary approaches that focus only on the calorie or carbohydrate content of foods. Providing individuals with tools to manage their glycemic responses to food based on personalized predictions of their PPGRs may allow them to maintain their blood glucose levels within limits associated with good health.”</p>

<div class="md"><p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Observational studies support an association between a low blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, whether vitamin D supplementation lowers the risk of diabetes is unknown.</p>

<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>

<p>We randomly assigned adults who met at least two of three glycemic criteria for prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose level, 100 to 125 mg per deciliter; plasma glucose level 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, 140 to 199 mg per deciliter; and glycated hemoglobin level, 5.7 to 6.4%) and no diagnostic criteria for diabetes to receive 4000 IU per day of vitamin D3 or placebo, regardless of the baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. The primary outcome in this time-to-event analysis was new-onset diabetes, and the trial design was event-driven, with a target number of diabetes events of 508.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong></p>

<p>A total of 2423 participants underwent randomization (1211 to the vitamin D group and 1212 to the placebo group). By month 24, the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in the vitamin D group was 54.3 ng per milliliter (from 27.7 ng per milliliter at baseline), as compared with 28.8 ng per milliliter in the placebo group (from 28.2 ng per milliliter at baseline). After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the primary outcome of diabetes occurred in 293 participants in the vitamin D group and 323 in the placebo group (9.39 and 10.66 events per 100 person-years, respectively). The hazard ratio for vitamin D as compared with placebo was 0.88 (0.95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.04; P=0.12). The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p><em>Among persons at high risk for type 2 diabetes not selected for vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D3 supplementation at a dose of 4000 IU per day did not result in a significantly lower risk of diabetes than placebo.</em> (Funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and others; D2d ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01942694.)</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s good to see negative results.</p>

<div class="md"><p><strong>Most</strong> Vitamin D RCTs have had null results. Either there&#39;s reverse causation at hand in the association of low D status and poorer health outcomes (unhealthy people don&#39;t get into the sun much), or there are benefits to sun exposure that aren&#39;t captured by D alone.</p>

  Meta-analyses never consider trials with co-factors, so if a researcher wants his data to be used he does not use cofactors</p>

<p>4) Many trials use too small a dose to possibly make a difference 
  Have seen many trials just using 1,000 IU 
  One trial used just 200 IU - and did not find a difference!! 
  Imagine a trial using 1/20 a dose of Aspirin - it would be very unlikely to find any benefit</p>

<p>5) RCTs require a placebo group, but many researchers now find it unethical to not give vitamin D to all participants 
  so their trial is not an RCT - note that an increasing Percentage of the Vitamin D proofs are not RCT</p>

<p>6) Some RCTs are now terminated because 
   Researchers found too much pain/suffering in those getting the placebo 
   Too many participants getting the placebo dropped out as they noticed the other group feeling much better and having fewer health problems</p>

<p>7) Some countries (about 30%) consider a mere 20 nanograms to be sufficient 
   When they compare those with &lt; 20 nanograms to those with &gt; 20 nanograms they do not see any benefit 
   Occasionally they include charts of the data - in which the benefits of vitamin D can be seen at 30 or 40 nanograms</p>

<p>8) RCTs ignore gene differences 
   There is at least a 3 times increased risk for 12 diseases for people having just a Vitamin D Receptor problem 
   Note: There are 5 additional important Vitamin D genes</p>

<p>9) RCTs sometimes use long time between doses </p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 week dosing interval provides less benefit 
6 month dosing invervals can result in problems (negative benefits)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>10) RCT researchers are occasionally rewarded for NOT finding a benefit 
   Example; Professor who concluded that vitamin D (800 IU) does not help bones got 324,000 dollar prize- Nov 2015</p>

<p>11) RCTs rarely use loading doses to restore vitamin D levels in a week or so 
   Without loading doses many people will fail to show a benefit/get repleted within the typical short RCT length</p>

<p>12) Some RCTs mistakenly continue to use Vitamin D2 
   D2 is significantly less effective the D3 - especially for non-daily doses 
   Sometimes D2 actually reduces the level of D3 
   Over a decade ago Vets decided that Vitamin D2 should not be used on any mammal - guess we hsve to remind Doctors that humans are mammals</p>

<p>There is fairly good evidence that intestinal permeability leads to the development of type 1 diabetes (diabetes caused by the body attacking insulin-producing cells) in diabetes-prone rats.</p>

<ol>
<li> Alessio Fasano and his colleagues have discovered that the giladin in gluten binds to the CXCR3 receptor and causes the body to produce zonulin, which leads to an increase in intestinal permeability. See “<a href="https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/physrev.00003.2008">Zonulin and Intestinal Barrier Function</a>” for a review of the research on the subject.</li>
<li> In BioBreeding diabetic-prone (BBDP) rats, elevated levels of zonulin and increased intestinal permeability precede the development of type 1 diabetes. (See the discussion of T1D on page 14 of  <a href="https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/physrev.00003.2008">the paper mentioned earlier</a>  for more details.)</li>
<li> When these rats are given a zonulin inhibitor, Larazotide Acetate (also known as FZI/0 or AT-1001), the intestinal permeability is restored and the rats develop T1D at a much lower rate. The  <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/102/8/2916.full.pdf">relevant study</a>  found that:

<ol>
<li> Without the inhibitor, 11 out of 15 rats developed type 1 diabetes (<strong>73%</strong>).</li>
<li> With the inhibitor, 3 out of 15 rats developed type 1 diabetes (<strong>20%</strong>).</li>
</ol></li>
<li> Despite Fasano’s enthusiasm, these results could not be replicated in humans as that particular zonulin inhibitor doesn’t affect intestinal permeability in humans (see  <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/apt.12147">here</a>and  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ajg2012211">here</a> for the results of 2 different trials reported in 2012).</li>

<div class="md"><p>There are RCT:s showing that elimination diets can help autoimmune disease:</p>

<p><a href="https://obscurescience.com/2018/11/28/dietary-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/">https://obscurescience.com/2018/11/28/dietary-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/</a></p>

<h1>Dietary causes of rheumatoid arthritis</h1>

<p>Posted on  <a href="https://obscurescience.com/2018/11/28/dietary-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/" title="7:36 pm">November 28, 2018</a>  by  <a href="https://obscurescience.com/author/glennchan/" title="View all posts by Glenn Chan">Glenn Chan</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, many rheumatologists do not learn about dietary causes of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in school. Nonetheless, the scientific literature clearly describes remission of the disease when triggering foods are eliminated. <strong>For some RA patients, the condition can be reversed through diet (!)</strong>. Of course, triggering foods must be avoided for drug-free remission to continue.</p>

<h2>The science</h2>

<p>For a scientific overview of diet-based treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, a good starting point would be  <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1018.9611&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">L. Gail Darlington and N. W. Ramsey’s 1993 review</a>, particularly the section on Dietary Elimination Therapy (page 3 in the PDF / pg 509). To summarize what we know:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Elimination diets work for some people</strong>. According to Gail Darlington, her elimination diet protocol works in about  <strong>35-40%</strong>  of RA patients. (Source: the second page of  <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-59259-652-2_14">her chapter on RA in <em>Diet and Human Immune Function</em></a>.) Other diet studies show anywhere from similar remissions levels to no remission at all.</li>
<li>  <strong>The more eliminating diets tend to have higher remission rates</strong>. Various diets have been studied: elimination diets, vegan, raw vegan, starch-based vegan, vegetarian, elemental diets (engineered meal replacements), and the Mediterranean diet. Elimination diets have shown the highest remission rates. The science suggests that the strongest dietary factor is the elimination of problematic foods.</li>
<li>  <strong>Every patient is different</strong>. In the elimination diet approach, problematic foods differ from patient to patient.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the key randomized controlled trials demonstrating the effectiveness of elimination diets are:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <em>Placebo-controlled, blind study of dietary manipulation therapy in rheumatoid arthritis</em>. (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673686907749">Abstract</a>,  <a href="http://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(86">full paper</a>90774-9).)<br/>
This study by L. Gail Darlington (the same Gail Darlington discussed earlier), N. W. Ramsey, J. R. Mansfield was published in  <em>The Lancet</em>, one of the world’s most prestigious medical journals. It found a significantly greater benefit from the elimination diet versus placebo. Among the 48 test subjects, 85% identified foods that made their symptoms worse.</li>
<li>  Hicklin JA, McEwen LM, Morgan JE. <em>The effect of diet in rheumatoid arthritis</em>. Clin Allergy 1980;10:463.<br/>
This exclusion diet improved outcomes for 24 of 72 RA patients (<strong>33%</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Appendix A: Veg*n diets</strong></p>

<p>There have been multiple studies of vegetarian and vegan diets, with less success than the diet tested by Gail Darlington and her colleagues.</p>

<div class="md"><p><strong>Intestinal Permeability in Autoimmune Diseases and Cancer: Measurement, Results, and Implications</strong></p>

<p><em>Dr. Zsófia Clemens is a neurobiologist and clinical researcher specialising in nutrition, nutritional therapy and brain research. Currently she runs the ICMNI (the International Center for Medical Nutritional Intervention), where they have been treating chronic disease with the plant-free ketogenic diet called the PKD — the paleolithic ketogenic diet since 2013.</em></p>

<p>More on PKD here: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323151200_Therapeutic_protocol_of_Paleomedicina_Hungary">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323151200_Therapeutic_protocol_of_Paleomedicina_Hungary</a> and <a href="/r/PaleolithicKetogenic">r/PaleolithicKetogenic</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It is not just a claim, they have actually resolved several patients&#39; medical condition using PKD. Occasionally they publish a report of those, eg: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bxm22f/treatment_of_highgrade_brain_tumor_using_the/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bxm22f/treatment_of_highgrade_brain_tumor_using_the/</a></p>

<p>(You&#39;ll observe a bit of cynical skepticism in that thread too; I wonder if the ketogenic/carnivore aspect of their work is making people doubtful beyond reasonable limit inasmuch as we live in a plant-based-diet-biased world).</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>A case study of three patients, one of which that died at 11 months and the other two being alive at 25 and 14 months is nothing remotely substantial and is certainly not a &quot;definite cure.&quot;</p>

<p>I understand that many people are apprehensive about carnivore diets but the same skepticism would be brought up if it was a study regarding the effects of a plant-based diet on brain cancer.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Not a cure but I think a lot of doctors would pat themselves on the back if they extended a cancer patient&#39;s life by 14 to 25 months. Depending on the type of cancer of course, but an additional year of life is the best we can do in many cases.</p>

<p>Of course it&#39;s difficult to attribute the patient&#39;s longevity to the treatment, but 25 months isn&#39;t something to scoff at when it comes to cancer.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>A case study of three patients, one of which that died at 11 months and the other two being alive at 25 and 14 months is nothing remotely substantial and ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You left out the part where the third patient started taking additional therapies and then experienced progression before dying; furthermore the other two were not merely &quot;alive&quot; as they were also progression-free. Moreover, Zsófia has reported <a href="https://www.paleomedicina.com/en/paleolithic_ketogenic_diet_PKD_in_chronic_diseases_clinical_and_research_data">47 cancer patients</a> in total. Besides, this is all moot - as you are arguing your feeling of suspicion based on a cherry-picked example. Besides discrediting Zsófia or her organization, do you have anything to say about the video itself?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is certainly not a &quot;definite cure.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is, then, your definition of &quot;definite cure&quot; if not being progression-free for 14+ months on the diet?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Perhaps I misspoke, I didn&#39;t mean the additional 25 months itself wasn&#39;t substantial. Yes that can be a lot of extra time with a glioblastoma. My point was that a case study involving two patients that happened to extend their life by 1-2 years is not substantial evidence for a cure, which is what they claim to offer.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I left it out as I figured it didn&#39;t matter as the patient still remained on the diet. It&#39;s not like the radiotherapy would have made the tumor even more aggressive and then kill them 9 months after said therapy. Plus the authors make no inference that it was the reason why they died. It must be noted that the patient had a glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of brain cancer. Doesn&#39;t matter that they showed no symptoms for 2 months, that&#39;s how brain cancer often works, even aggressive tumors like glioblastomas. You can be perfectly fine then all of a sudden you can go into a nosedive.</p>

<p>I see that they are treating 47 patients but from my understanding, only 6 have so far outperformed their diagnosis (with 2 of them being cancers with a high survival rate in the first place). Too early to make any confirmations. And I don&#39;t call a patient being alive 14 months after diagnosis a definite cure because cancer can take years to return. </p>

<p>Having numerous patients that all live at least 10-15 years after diagnosis of an aggressive tumor like a glioblastoma would be grounds for saying you have the definite cure.</p>

<p>I apologize for not being on the topic of the video, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d get into a long conversation like this haha.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yeah, cure is too bold a claim. Interesting may be a more appropriate term.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Background: Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease. Previous studies have suggested the beneficial effects of moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages on reducing cardiovascular risk (CVR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of acute consumption of Andalusian aged wine (AAW) and gin by analyzing the expression of genes related to the appearance and progression of atherosclerosis in men with high CVR.</p>

<p>Methods: We performed an open, randomized, controlled, crossover trial including 41 men with high CVR between 55 and 80 years age, who received a single dose of AAW or gin (0.5 g ethanol/kg). The expression of 10 genes related to atherosclerosis was determined by RT-PCR at baseline and 4 h after the intervention.</p>

<p>Results: Gene expression analysis 4 h after consumption of each alcoholic beverage showed a significant decrease in Toll-like receptors 4 and 6 (TLR4, TLR6) and Caspase-1 (p &lt; 0.05 all). Additionally, TLR2, Interleukin-1 receptor, chemokine receptor 3 and inflammasome expression decreased after AAW intake (p &lt; 0.05, all) while only chemokine receptor 5 decreased after gin consumption (p 1⁄4 0.039). </p>

<p>Conclusion: The decrease in the expression of several genes related to the appearance and progression of atherosclerosis was greater after AAW than gin intake, suggesting that the phenolic content of AAW may play a protective role against atherosclerosis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Importance</strong>  Lowering serum cholesterol levels is a well-established treatment for dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, nerve lesions in patients with T2D increase with lower serum cholesterol levels, suggesting that lowering serum cholesterol levels is associated with diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in patients with T2D.  </p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>  To investigate whether there is an association between serum cholesterol levels and peripheral nerve lesions in patients with T2D with and without DPN.  </p>

<p><strong>Design, Setting, and Participants</strong>  This single-center, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study was performed from June 1, 2015, to March 31, 2018. Observers were blinded to clinical data. A total of 256 participants were approached, of whom 156 were excluded. A total of 100 participants consented to undergo magnetic resonance neurography of the right leg at the Department of Neuroradiology and clinical, serologic, and electrophysiologic assessment at the Department of Endocrinology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.  </p>

<p><strong>Exposures</strong>  Quantification of the nerve’s diameter and lipid equivalent lesion (LEL) load with a subsequent analysis of all acquired clinical and serologic data with use of 3.0-T magnetic resonance neurography of the right leg with 3-dimensional reconstruction of the sciatic nerve.  </p>

<p><strong>Main Outcomes and Measures</strong>  The primary outcome was lesion load and extension. Secondary outcomes were clinical, serologic, and electrophysiologic findings.  </p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>  A total of 100 participants with T2D (mean [SD] age, 64.6 [0.9] years; 68 [68.0%] male) participated in the study. The LEL load correlated positively with the nerve’s mean cross-sectional area (<em>r</em> = 0.44; <em>P</em> &lt; .001) and the maximum length of a lesion (<em>r</em> = 0.71; <em>P</em> &lt; .001). The LEL load was negatively associated with total serum cholesterol level (<em>r</em> = −0.41; <em>P</em> &lt; .001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (<em>r</em> = −0.30; <em>P</em> = .006), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (<em>r</em> = −0.33; <em>P</em> = .003), nerve conduction velocities of the tibial (<em>r</em> = −0.33; <em>P</em> = .01) and peroneal (<em>r</em> = −0.51; <em>P</em> &lt; .001) nerves, and nerve conduction amplitudes of the tibial (<em>r</em> = −0.31; <em>P</em> = .02) and peroneal (<em>r</em> = −0.28; <em>P</em> = .03) nerves.  </p>

<p><strong>Conclusions and Relevance</strong>  The findings suggest that lowering serum cholesterol levels in patients with T2D and DPN is associated with a higher amount of nerve lesions and declining nerve conduction velocities and amplitudes. These findings may be relevant to emerging therapies that promote an aggressive lowering of serum cholesterol levels in patients with T2D.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.sfb1158.de/">is the org</a> that seems to have provided the most grants. Seems legit.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>This seems like a correlation that should generate research and followup but isn&#39;t showing cause since it&#39;s a snapshot/observation at a point in time.  Very concerning though since some statins can provoke T2D as a side effect.</p>

<p>&quot;Thus, our results suggest that a low serum cholesterol level is  associated with the formation of LELs in T2D DPN. The findings of this  study are not completely in line with previous results on the formation  of LELs in DPN that have only found a correlation of LEL load with  decreasing HDL-C levels but not LDL-C or total serum cholesterol levels  in DPN.<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2734805#zoi190203r10">1</a>&quot;</p>

<p>There is other research that low-HDL [correlates with] increases in LEL load.  I think we need a followup observing T2D, or even better people pre-diabetic, to see impact of blood lipids over time.</p>

<p>If high blood glucose is damaging nerves, it make sense that you want fat in the blood around for repair.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>

<p>Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a major health problem worldwide and its prevalence in Saudi Arabia has reached 31.6%. Patients with diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of thyroid disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the urinary excretion of iodine in type 2 DM (T2DM) patients, and to assess the clinical implication of iodine status on T2DM.</p>

<p>METHODS:</p>

<p>A total of 266 adult Saudis aged 18-55 years (109 T2DM patients and 157 healthy controls) were randomly selected from the Riyadh Cohort Study. Subjects were assessed for anthropometry, morning blood chemistries including fasting glucose, and lipid profile; serum concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, resistin, insulin, aPAI, hsCRP, Ang II, TNF-α, TSH, T3, T4, urine creatinine, urine iodine were measured using specific assays.</p>

<p>RESULTS:</p>

<p>The concentration of urine iodine was significantly lower in T2DM than in healthy control subjects (84.6±2.3 vs. 119.4±3.4, p&lt;0.001), which remained significant after creatinine correction and controlling for age (p=0.01). Furthermore, urinary iodine is negatively correlated with waist, hips, SAD, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR triglyceride, resistin, angiotensin II (Ang II), and CRP, while it was positively associated with TSH.</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS:</p>

<p>The decreased levels of iodine concentration in T2DM patients and its likely deleterious effects on metabolic functions calls for a systematic approach to thyroid disease screening in diabetic patients. Routine annual urinary iodine determination is recommended and should target T2DM patients at risk of thyroid dysfunction.</p>

<p>The new joint American Diabetes Association (ADA) / European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) position paper [1] published online ahead of print on October 4th now classifies a low carbohydrate diet as Medical Nutrition Therapy. in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes in adults. What this means is these two organizations which are responsible for educating over 30 million Americans and 60 million Europeans diagnosed with Diabetes consider a low carbohydrate not only safe, but effective therapeutic treatment. This recognition comes on the heels of Diabetes Australia having just released in late August their own updated position paper designed to provide practical advice and information for people diagnosed with Diabetes who are considering adopting a low carbohydrate eating plan [2].</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3fO5aTD6JU">Dr. Benjamin Bikman - &#39;Insulin vs. Glucagon: The relevance of dietary protein&#39;</a></p>

<p>Seems like proteins effect on insulin is strongly dependent on available sugar/glucose</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>This is a common area of confusion. Insulin is a general-purpose absorption hormone that operates for both glucose and amino acid absorption. </p>

<p>The general view is that insulin causes the body to pull glucose out of the bloodstream, but that is really only the operation of insulin by itself. Those receptors are sensitive to the insulin/glucagon ratio being high, and high protein leads to release of both insulin and glucagon.</p>

<p>It pretty much has to work this way; if high protein caused a carb-like insulin response, the body would pull too much glucose out of the blood and you would be hypoglycemic.</p>

<p>Insulin isn&#39;t a bad thing by itself. The problem is the high blood glucose that leads to high levels of insulin, and the insulin resistance that leads to chronic high blood glucose and hyperinsulinemia.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p><em>Chronic high insulin</em> is bad for general health and so for longevity.  Like most hormonal systems in the body, it is expected to vary.  Low most of the time, high when you eat, going back to low because you didn&#39;t eat again for 6 hours (like adults used to do, lunch at noon, dinner at 6pm).</p>

<p>The focus on insulin in response to (usually animal based) protein miss the critical role of glucagon, which is also released when protein is consumed.  The two hormones work in a synergistic manner that&#39;s different from insulin alone or insulin with low glucagon.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Insulin promotes protein uptake into the muscles, so it makes sense that protein would cause such a response. It also probably has many other interactions. Don’t judge protein’s affect on metabolism just by this one fact.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Im curious about complete proteins when it comes to plant-based protein specifically the effects on muscle protein synthesis. I learned that plant-based protein usually lacks 1-2 EAA&#39;s (Gorissen et al., 2018). So in order to obtain all essential AAs and make your meal a complete protein, you can eat certain foods together like beans and rice. Just wondering if anyone has read any papers on whether that complementary protein meal has to be consumed in one sitting for best absorption/MPS or if the effects are the same if you consume those missing AAs from other foods throughout the day... I hope this makes sense. It makes sense in my head haha. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Gorissen, S. H., Crombag, J. J., Senden, J. M., Waterval, W. H., Bierau, J., Verdijk, L. B., &amp; van Loon, L. J. (2018). Protein content and amino acid composition of commercially available plant-based protein isolates. <em>Amino acids</em>, <em>50</em>(12), 1685-1695.</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>This has been considered outdated for some time.  Yes, you will need all the amino acids for a complete protein eventually, but it isn&#39;t at all necessary to get a balanced set in a single meal.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>may be of interest to you:</p>

<p><a href="https://sigmanutrition.com/episode123/">https://sigmanutrition.com/episode123/</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Specifically about leucine threshold.  Some veg protein sources are so low in leucine that you won&#39;t really stimulate MPS unless you consume triple the grams of total protein vs. whey or other sources.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking forward to research on the effects of individual and combined AAs.</p>

<div class="md"><p>As the other poster mentioned, protein combining is not required. For more detail, I recommend this Stronger By Science article from last year:</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>I read many papers on that too! Yes, such an interesting topic for sure. Its usually either low in lysine or leucine, I read some papers that talked about fortification with these supps.

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In 1874, Sir William W. Gull, MD, published his observations in five women suffering from hypothyroidism,
which he called myxedema associated with a “cretinoid
state.”1
 Hypothyroidism was for a short time afterward
called Gull’s disease. This condition of unknown etiology was considered incurable then.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Some 16 years after Gull’s report, a
successful attempt was made to implant a sheep thyroid
gland under the skin of the inframammary area of a
woman suffering from myxedema. The operation was
followed by immediate improvement. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>One year after Murray’s publication, physicians
MacKenzie3
 and Fox4
 reported respectively that oral administration of fresh sheep thyroid glands3
 and thyroid
extract4
 were effective in reversing the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism in a female patient. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Prior to 1895, thyroid extracts were not standardized
based on iodine content because the presence of iodine </p>

<p>in the active principle of the thyroid gland was not yet
reported. Following Baumans’ publication in 18955
 reporting high concentrations of iodine tightly bound to
proteins in extracts of the thyroid gland, thyroid extracts
were standardized to contain 0.2% iodine in order to
maintain equal potency of different preparations.
The popularity of thyroid extracts was not adversely affected by the introduction of thyroid hormones in the</p>

<p>1930s. Thyroid extracts continued to be prescribed by
the majority of US physicians who claimed better response than with the use of the pure preparation of thyroxine. This trend was to change following a hoax perpetrated in 1963 with the goal of discouraging the use of
thyroid extracts and therefore, making thyroxine the only
eligible thyroid preparation for hypothyroidism. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The medical letter in 1973 maintained that desiccated thyroid had never been unreliable. The slight
variations in the T3 levels mentioned by some are of little clinical significance. A large shipment to distributors
in Europe and the United States in 1963 of what was
supposed to be desiccated thyroid turned out to be tablets that contained iodine but no thyroid hormone. This
was a hoax. Goodman and Gilman stated, ‘This episode
gave thyroid a bad name because several publications
about the unreliability of thyroid appeared before the
hoax was uncovered.’ (1970) This hoax is the only record of desiccated thyroid being unreliable.”</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In the late 1800s, the data available suggested that hypothyroidism was due to a deficiency of a substance secreted by the thyroid gland, and this biologically active substance was orally bioavailable. As previously mentioned, the iodine involvement in this thyroidal compound was not suspected until 1895, when Bauman reported large concentrations of protein-bound iodine in the thyroid gland.5 Based on his research, Bauman concluded that the active substance in the thyroid gland contains iodine. Afterward, the general medical consensus was that the active principle of the thyroid gland contains iodine, and as a consequence, the thyroid preparations were standardized to contain 0.2% iodine in order to obtain the same concentrations of the active thyroid principle, and therefore the same potency between different batches.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Looking at your post history, you sure do like iodine. What’s your experience with it? Do you have thyroid issues?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I have heard about people getting great results with above RDA doses of iodine for some time but didn&#39;t take it to seriously. Eventually got around to try it and the effects where dramatic. Currently trying to learn as much as i can about it. There are some risks with higher than RDA doses, the more i know the less is the risk i fuck myself up. </p>

<p>Have only experimented with taking high dose iodine for less than a week. 1 drop of Lugols iodine 6.25mg. I also take the recommended co-factors magnesium and selenium which theoreticaly should reduce risk close to zero.</p>

<p>Effects have been increased energy, motivation, mental clarity, feeling harmonious, warmer body, more than doubled my HRV.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Abstract</p>

<p>Purpose
To investigate the effects of eating wholegrain rye bread with high or low amounts of phytate on iron status in women under free-living conditions.</p>

<p>Methods
In this 12-week, randomized, parallel-design intervention study, 102 females were allocated into two groups, a high-phytate-bread group or a low-phytate-bread group. These two groups were administered: 200 g of blanched wholegrain rye bread/day, or 200 g dephytinized wholegrain rye bread/day. The bread was administered in addition to their habitual daily diet. Iron status biomarkers and plasma alkylresorcinols were analyzed at baseline and post-intervention.</p>

<p>Results
Fifty-five females completed the study. In the high-phytate-bread group (n = 31) there was no change in any of the iron status biomarkers after 12 weeks of intervention (p &gt; 0.05). In the low-phytate bread group (n = 24) there were significant decreases in both ferritin (mean = 12%; from 32 ± 7 to 27 ± 6 µg/L, geometric mean ± SEM, p &lt; 0.018) and total body iron (mean = 12%; from 6.9 ± 1.4 to 5.4 ± 1.1 mg/kg, p &lt; 0.035). Plasma alkylresorcinols indicated that most subjects complied with the intervention.</p>

<p>Conclusions
In Swedish females of reproductive age, 12 weeks of high-phytate wholegrain bread consumption had no effect on iron status. However, consumption of low-phytate wholegrain bread for 12 weeks resulted in a reduction of markers of iron status. Although single-meal studies clearly show an increase in iron bioavailability from dephytinization of cereals, medium-term consumption of reduced phytate bread under free-living conditions suggests that this strategy does not work to improve iron status in healthy women of reproductive age.</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>I think I remember reading in one (or 2) studies on phytates that the type of phytate consumed is what affects the absorption. Some phytates enhance absorption of zinc for example, while others inhibit it&#39;s absorption.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Interesting.</p>

<p>Relevent discussion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the purposes of inhibition of metal uptake, it has been shown that it is the first 10–20 mg phytate-P in a meal exerts the largest inhibitory effect, and that additionally increase of phytate-P in the same meal has a relatively minor effect [8, 9, 13]. Thus, a nearly complete elimination of phytate content is necessary to have any effect on iron bioavailability. Phytates coming from other parts of the subjects’ habitual diet may have nullified any effect of the low-phytate bread on iron bioavailability.</p>

<p>In the low-phytate bread group there was an unexpected decrease in markers of iron status. We had hypothesized that the low-phytate intervention bread would increase the availability of iron leading to an increase in iron status. However, an explanation for the opposite effect is not immediately clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>tldr they hypothesise that this is due to the two groups incidentally eating less/more meat and citrus</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Just 75 g of wholegrain wheat/rye .</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yes that’s an interesting point. I wonder if it has a relation to the type of fiber or food their bound to (like the phytic acid of a leaf of kale versus the content of a whole grain bread slice)</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yeah; now that i remember, it wasn&#39;t phytates, i think it was polyphenols they were talking about. But you could still be right</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During 2 weeks, a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study was conducted on 116 subjects that were initially recruited. Seventy-two subjects started the study, being divided into four groups, and only 60 completed the study as designed. The aim was to compare the effects of calcium fructoborate to placebo on subjects diagnosed with knee primary osteoarthritis. The obtained outcomes were inflammation biomarkers (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and lipid markers (triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol). No serious adverse events were reported. The calcium fructoborate showed beneficial effect on the inflammatory markers for all groups subjected to the treatment when compared with the placebo group and slight changes in the lipid metabolism. This study suggests that short-term (2 weeks) calcium fructoborate supplementation in patients with osteoarthritis symptoms has a favorable prognosis on inflammation diseases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this study, 60 participants with self-reported knee discomfort were randomized into two groups receiving CFB or placebo. Initial levels of knee discomfort were evaluated by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) scores at the beginning of the study and also at 7 and 14 days after treatment. Results showed that supplementation with CFB significantly improved knee discomfort in the study subjects; significant reductions of mean within-subject change in WOMAC and MPQ scores were observed for the CFB group compared to the placebo group at both 7 and 14 days after treatment. Estimated treatment differences for the MPQ score were −5.8 (P=0.0009) and −8.9 (P&lt;0.0001) at Day 7 and 14, respectively. Estimated differences for the WOMAC score were −5.3 (P=0.06) and −13.73 (P&lt;0.0001) at Day 7 and 14, respectively. Negative values indicate greater reductions in reported discomfort. On both Day 7 and Day 14, the trend was toward greater improvement in the CFB group. The placebo group did not exhibit any change in the WOMAC and MPQ scores. In conclusion, supplementation with 110 mg CFB twice per day was associated with improving knee discomfort during the 2 weeks of intake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Participants received placebo or CFB at a dose of 112 mg/day (CFB-1) or 56 mg/day (CFB-2) for 30 days. Glucose, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides (TG), C-reactive protein (CRP), homocysteine, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were determined before and after supplementation. CFB-1 showed a reduction in blood levels of CRP by 31.3 % compared to baseline. CFB-1 and CFB-2 reduced LDL levels by 9.8 and 9.4 %, respectively. CFB-1 decreased blood homocysteine by 5.5 % compared with baseline, whereas CFB-2 did not have a significant effect. Blood levels of TG were reduced by 9.1 and 8.8 % for CFB-1 and CFB-2, respectively. Use of both CFB-1 and CFB-2 resulted in significantly reduced IL-6 levels, when compared within and between groups. IL-1β was reduced by 29.2 % in the CFB-1 group. Finally, CFB-1 and CFB-2 reduced MCP-1 by 31 and 26 %, respectively. Our data indicate that 30-day supplementation with 112 mg/day CFB (CFB-1) resulted in a significant reduction of LDL, TG, TC, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, and CRP. HDL levels were increased, when compared to baseline and placebo. These results suggest that CFB might provide beneficial support to healthy cardiovascular systems by positively affecting these blood markers</p>

<p>A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial with 60 days treatment period was carried out at Baghdad Teaching Hospital, Medical city, Baghdad, Iraq. Eighty RA patients were randomized into three groups to receive either 220 mg/day CFB, 55 mg/day NTB in capsule dosage form (equivalent to 6 mg elemental Boron), or placebo formula once daily. Only 72 patients completed the study. All patients were clinically evaluated utilizing DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), simple disease activity index-C-reactive protein (CRP), and clinical disease activity index scores at baseline, and at the end of the study. Venous blood was obtained at baseline and after 60 days, and utilized for the measurement of ESR, hemoglobin, in addition to evaluation of high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and IL-6. After 60 days, both types of boron significantly improve the clinical scores, in association with significant decrease in the serum levels of ESR, hsCRP, IL-1α, IL-6, and TNF-α with remarkable superiority for calcium fructoborate (CFB) over sodium tetraborate (NTB), compared to baseline and placebo-treated group.</p>

<p>Here is a review of the previous studies as well as a recommendation to prefer the organic boron complexes over the borax formula:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4930945/">Calcium Fructoborate for Bone and Cardiovascular Health</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The three-borate forms contained by the hydrolyzed calcium fructoborate (diester, monoester, and boric acid) are all biologically active, both at the intracellular (boric acid) and extracellular levels (diester and monoester). Transportation of the boric acid through the cellular membrane is being accomplished by free diffusion or is facilitated by aquaporin-like protein transporter. Recently, it has been reported that boron is not being transported as borate anion [34], but only as boric acid. If so, the exact mechanism of boron transportation in the animal cell remains unclear [35–37]. Consequently, CF is superior to the boric acid/borate due to its complex action mechanism, both at the intracellular (as free boric acid) and extracellular level (as fructose-borate esters). Moreover, the free boric acid resulting from hydrolysis of the fructoborate complex may be less toxic than the dietary supplement intake of the regular boric acid/borax/sodium borate. Because CF has been shown to be an efficient, non-toxic precursor of the borate anion, having multiple published studies on its numerous potential contributions to human health, nutritional supplementation with CF offers significant benefits in support of healthy bone and joints, as well as for cardiovascular health.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The unique properties of SBEs suggest new pathways and opportunities to employ these molecules as supplemental and therapeutic agents. The recent discoveries that SBEs mimic enzymatic pleiotropic modulators or cofactors provide a key consideration in our determination that some of these B species are essential or at least conditionally essential for humans [4, 11, 68, 113]. Based upon the evidence thus far, we propose here that the safety, functionality, and efficacy of SBEs are favorable for many physiological functions when compared to inorganic boron derivatives such as boric acid/borax. This is likely attributable to the tendency of organic boron compounds to remain in their organic form (in comparison to inorganic forms that dissociate rapidly), thereby conferring benefits such as coenzyme or cofactor activities and/or anti-inflammatory effects that subsequently impart the clinically relevant benefits that have been reported [4]. Consequently, the aim of our research going forward is to more fully understand the critical role and mechanisms of action of these SBEs and their related B species in human health and, ultimately, to address following questions: (i) Is fructoborate an essential, or at least a conditionally essential, nutrient for human health, and/or (ii) could any of the aforementioned SBEs actually have sufficient importance to be eventually considered to be natural boron-containing vitamins?</p>

<p>As for <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/15#512">food sources of boron</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hunt and coworkers (1991) reported that the highest concentrations of boron were found in fruit-based beverages and products, tubers, and legumes....Negligible or minimal amounts (less than 0.100 μg/g) were found in animal products, certain grain products, condiments, and confections....Meacham and Hunt (1998) reported that the ten foods with the highest concentration of boron were avocado, peanut butter, peanuts, prune and grape juice, chocolate powder, wine, pecans, and granola raisin and raisin bran cereals. Rainey and coworkers (1999), however, examined both the content and total food consumption (amount and frequency), reporting that the five major contributors of boron were coffee, milk, apples, dried beans, and potatoes, which collectively accounted for 27 percent of the dietary boron consumption.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Since 1963, evidence has accumulated that suggests boron is a safe and effective treatment for some forms of arthritis. The initial evidence was that boron supplementation alleviated arthritic pain and discomfort of the author. This was followed by findings from numerous other observations epidemiologic and controlled animal and human experiments. These findings included a) analytical evidence of lower boron concentrations in femur heads, bones, and synovial fluid from people with arthritis than from those without this disorder; b) observation evidence that bones of patients using boron supplements are much harder to cut than those of patients not using supplements; c) epidemiologic evidence that in areas of the world where boron intakes usually are 1.0 mg or less/day the estimated incidence of arthritis ranges from 20 to 70%, whereas in areas of the world where boron intakes are usually 3 to 10 mg, the estimated incidence of arthritis ranges from 0 to 10%; d) experimental evidence that rats with induced arthritis benefit from orally or intraperitoneally administered boron; e) experimental evidence from a double-blind placebo-boron supplementation trial with 20 subjects with osteoarthritis. A significant favorable response to a 6 mg boron/day supplement was obtained; 50% of subjects receiving the supplement improved compared to only 10% receiving the placebo. The preceding data indicate that boron is an essential nutrient for healthy bones and joints, and that further research into the use of boron for the treatment or prevention of arthritis is warranted.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>In conclusion, over 30 years of accumulating evidence indicates that boron is essential for healthy bones and joints. Both
epidemiologic and controlled animal and
human experiments suggest that boron
supplementation in amounts found in
some diets throughout the world is effective in preventing or treating various forms
of arthritis. Thus, boron is a nutrient and
therefore should not be considered a poison or a pharmaceutical. Because boron is
of apparent clinical and nutritional importance, efforts should be expanded to assure
that people consume enough of this
important element every day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hunt and coworkers (1991) reported that the highest concentrations of boron were found in fruit-based beverages and products, tubers, and legumes....Negligible or minimal amounts (less than 0.100 μg/g) were found in animal products, certain grain products, condiments, and confections....Meacham and Hunt (1998) reported that the ten foods with the highest concentration of boron were avocado, peanut butter, peanuts, prune and grape juice, chocolate powder, wine, pecans, and granola raisin and raisin bran cereals. Rainey and coworkers (1999), however, examined both the content and total food consumption (amount and frequency), reporting that the five major contributors of boron were coffee, milk, apples, dried beans, and potatoes, which collectively accounted for 27 percent of the dietary boron consumption.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Did you find anything on optimal ranges and TUL?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just the same NAP chapter you linked to.  There is no RDA since a dietary <em>requirement</em> has not been established at this point, and the TUL is a conservative value since it is based on rodent studies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because no data are available on adverse reproductive effects in humans from the consumption of large amounts of boron from food and water, animal data were utilized to estimate the UL.</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>In the study by Price and coworkers (1996b), boric acid was fed to time-mated rats (60 per treatment group) from gestational days 0 to 20 at dosages of 3.3, 6.3, 9.6, 13.3, or 25 mg/kg/day. Maternal body weight did not differ among groups during gestation or lactation, and weight gain was not affected by the amount of boron in the diet. <strong>The most sensitive parameter of developmental toxicity was decreased fetal weights at gestational day 20, with significantly decreased fetal weights found only in the 13.3 and 25 mg/kg/day groups. Thus, a NOAEL of 9.6 mg/kg/day and a LOAEL of 13.3 mg/kg/day were reported.</strong></p>

<p>In an earlier study in rats using a very similar experimental design, Heindel and coworkers (1992) reported <strong>an increase in fetal malformations with boric acid at dosages of 13.6, 28.5, and 57.7 mg/ kg/day from gestational days 0 to 20. The most common malformations were enlargement of lateral ventricles in the brain, shortening of rib XIII, and wavy ribs. Although a LOAEL was found at the lowest dose tested (13.6 mg/kg/day), it is similar to the LOAEL of 13.3 mg/kg/day reported by Price and coworkers (1996b)</strong>, a finding that provides additional support for the dose-response relationship for developmental toxicity as the critical effect.</p>

<p>Uncertainty Assessment. <strong>Five expert groups have assessed the risk to humans from boron using the NOAEL from Price and coworkers (1996b), and uncertainty factors (UFs) vary between 25 and 60 (Becking and Chen, 1998). There do not appear to be sufficient data to justify lowering the degree of uncertainty for extrapolating from experimental animals to humans from the 10 that is often used for nonessential chemicals. Thus, the usual value of 10 was selected. In view of the expected similarity in pharmokinetics among humans, however, a UF of 3 was chosen for intraspecies variability. These two UFs are multiplied to yield a UF of 30.</strong></p>

<p>Derivation of a UL. <strong>The NOAEL for developmental effects in rats is 9.6 mg/kg/day. The UL for boron is calculated by dividing the NOAEL of 9.6 mg/kg/day by the UF of 30, resulting in an UL of 0.3 mg/kg/day. This value was multiplied by the average of the reference body weights for adult women, 61 kg, from Chapter 1 (Table 1-1). The resulting UL for adults is rounded to 20 mg/day.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And because all of those acronyms are confusing, here is <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/5">some background</a> that explains how they all relate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives and <strong>various national regulatory bodies have identified factors (called uncertainty factors [UFs]) that account for interspecies and intraspecies differences in response to the hazardous effects of substances and for other uncertainties</strong> (WHO, 1987). UFs are used to make inferences about the threshold dose of substances for members of a large and diverse human population from data on adverse effects obtained in epidemiological or experimental studies. These factors are applied consistently when data of specific types and quality are available. They are typically used to derive acceptable daily intakes for food additives and other substances for which data on adverse effects are considered sufficient to meet minimum standards of quality and completeness (FAO/WHO, 1982). These adopted or recognized UFs have sometimes been coupled with other factors to compensate for deficiencies in the available data and other uncertainties regarding data.</p>

<p><strong>When possible, the UL is based on a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), which is the highest intake (or experimental oral dose) of a nutrient at which no adverse effects have been observed in the individuals studied.</strong> This is identified for a specific circumstance in the hazard identification and dose-response assessment steps of the risk assessment. <strong>If there are no adequate data demonstrating a NOAEL, then a lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) may be used. A LOAEL is the lowest intake (or experimental oral dose) at which an adverse effect has been identified. The derivation of a UL from a NOAEL (or LOAEL) involves a series of choices about what factors should be used to deal with uncertainties. Uncertainty factors are applied in an attempt to deal both with gaps in data and with incomplete knowledge about the inferences required (e.g., the expected variability in response within the human population).</strong> The problems of both data and inference uncertainties arise in all steps of the risk assessment.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Note that besides the safety concerns I pinned above, the only <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5289089/">rheumatoid RCT</a> I could find indicated that the borax form (sodium tetraborate) was inferior to an organic form (calcium fructoborate).  Nearly all food and supplemental forms are organic and may have greater efficacy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After 60 days, both types of boron significantly improve the clinical scores, in association with significant decrease in the serum levels of ESR, hsCRP, IL-1α, IL-6, and TNF-α with remarkable superiority for calcium fructoborate (CFB) over sodium tetraborate (NTB), compared to baseline and placebo-treated group.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying boron is a necessary mineral, and that certain forms of arthritis are really boron deprivation. Like how scurvy is vitamin c deprivation. I found this insightful:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cancer.cytoluminator.com/cancer-photodynamic-therapy/httpwww.health-science-spirit.com%20borax.pdf">http://www.cancer.cytoluminator.com/cancer-photodynamic-therapy/httpwww.health-science-spirit.com%20borax.pdf</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Source?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>To summarize it seems to have a pretty large safety margin and should probably be quite safe to supplement.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Good luck getting the organic form naturally. Boron has to be in the soil for the plants to absorb, then you have to eat the plants. Boron is now depleted in most farming soils throughout the world. Sure you could buy a supplement but they&#39;re stupidly expensive. Or buy a box of borax at Walmart for like $6 that will last a year or more and still give benefits. Considering what 99% of people put in their body on purpose, nevermind the polluted air most of us breathe, taking 1/8 teaspoon of borax is the least of anyone&#39;s concern.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>To be honest the only two sources I can find are these 2.</p>

<p><a href="https://selfhacked.com/blog/carnivore-diet/">If you don’t supplement, the best solution for getting enough boron on a carnivore diet is to consume bones.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/paulsaladinomd/p/BsObroJAuyU/?hl=en">Not much Boron in bone broth. It&#39;s either bone meal (you&#39;d want to be careful about sourcing this as they can have high lead levels) or a supplement if you&#39;re a carnivore like me.</a></p>

<p>I think the idea is that boron is stored in the bones so eating it would give you some boron.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Self reported data, or magic data. Feel free to disregard.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Oh, and I am gussing that they used Simpsons Pardox to calculate the numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s unfortunate they combined so many variables.  Repeatedly they refer to things like </p>

<p>&quot;Participants were encouraged to <em>avoid animal products (elimination) and most highly processed foods (limitation)</em> while eating unrestricted amounts of whole plant foods&quot;</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&quot;Yet, they reported important transformations in their definition of healthy eating which differed from their previous <em>meat-centered and highly processed food diet</em> and was coherent with the program goal of increasing whole plant food consumption&quot;</p>

<p>Was the change from removing processed foods?  Or was the change from reducing animal products?  We don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>We do know that any study encouraging replacing processed foods (including processed red meat) with whole foods (including unprocessed red meat) improves health. </p>

<p>This study seems to be really about a vegan diet based on whole foods, but they hide behind the &quot;WFPB&quot; until you read the significant anti-animal-products bias in the paper itself.  I find that very irritating.</p>

<p>My diet is whole foods and could be considered nearly plant based.  I just also then use animal products for my protein needs.   As these are whole and unprocessed animal products, they are whole foods.  Because most of my diet needs to be fat, I use a fair bit of refined fat/oil as well.  But when the fat comes with the protein, that&#39;s not refined, right?  Pork belly, or chicken thighs are whole foods (note I did NOT say bacon).</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Really? You think that most people wouldn&#39;t see health improvements switching from a standard american diet to a whole foods plant based diet?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to guess, you can read the study.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Just because they didn’t answer your question doesn’t mean they didn’t answer their question. </p>

<p>Your question: </p>

<p>Is it the removal of processed foods or animal products? </p>

<p>Their question:</p>

<p>“ We examined whether a 12-wk nutrition education program in adults from Montreal (Quebec, Canada) with at least one risk factor of cardiovascular disease was effective in modifying their eating patterns toward including more whole-plant foods. We further evaluated the effects of this program on participants&#39; cardiovascular outcomes and explored determinants influencing food choices toward whole-food, plant-based diets.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My diet is whole foods and could be considered nearly plant based. I just also then use animal products for my protein needs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are getting your protein from animal products then you aren’t plant based. What are your cholesterol levels if you don’t mind me asking?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t matter what I think. It matters what the evidence shows. This is not evidence of anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Why would anyone think that without scientific evidence?  I mean aside from personal intuition, what feels rights, etc (none of which are scientific anyway)?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>At first they would yeah, but then over time they&#39;d run into nutritional deficiencies.</p>

<p>Excluding animal products from your diet is not healthy long term and can result in serious health issues.</p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s a perfect example of Darwins natural selection though...</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>There have been so many studies that switching from the SAD to a whole foods ANY KIND diet, I don&#39;t see this paper being useful or adding to the science.</p>

<p>The &quot;plant based&quot; isn&#39;t the beneficial part (being as it is a veil for &quot;no animal products&quot;).  The whole foods is the benefit.  Less processed foods, more fiber from food, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t show how they calculated it. What good would reading the study do?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The researchers put together multiple variables in their study, which weakens their results and their claims, as they cannot demonstrate one or the other of the variables is the relevant one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are getting your protein from animal products then you aren’t plant based. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not by the &#39;but I don&#39;t want to be called vegan!&#39; definition of plant based, no.  However, keto, &quot;Paleo&quot;, LCHF are all whole foods diets and my intent is to emphasize that large overlap with the WF part of WFPB.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are your cholesterol levels if you don’t mind me asking?</p>

<p>I do mind you asking.  The anecdote of my lab results isn&#39;t relevant in discussing the science of nutrition.  </p>

<p>They&#39;re all within normal, which I know you have criticized in the past since you think people should have very low LDL regardless of the current recommended range.</p>

<p>Virta Health found a range of LDL responses to keto for the people in their clinical trial -- some people had it drop, some people had no change and some had an increase.  </p>

<p>ALL had lower trigs and almost all had higher HDL.  Along with of course normalized FBG (mine has always been normal though, even when overweight) which meant reduction in damage to their blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves due to high BG.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Fair enough, its not exactly ground-breaking science.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Any studies to back up your claims? Most health organizations disagree with you.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I agree completely. Whole foods are the key.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The Mediterranean diet is considered mostly plant based and it entails 2-3 servings of fish a week, even less poultry and red meat no more than a few times a month. That means most of their meals are vegetarian or vegan. Eating vegetables at every meal doesn’t mean you’re plant based. Americans eat so much meat any reduction makes them think they are plant based. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do mind you asking. The anecdote of my lab results isn&#39;t relevant in discussing the science of nutrition.</p>

<p>It is because it would show the reason why the diet you are eating isn’t plant based. Virtually no one eating any meaningful amount of animal products can achieve the cholesterol levels needed for reversal of atherosclerosis </p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/comments/atenxw/a_whole_lot_of_science/">this</a> list of links, and also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/comments/813i36/a_comprehensive_list_of_studies/">this</a> one.

<p>I evolved eating animals, so I&#39;ll continue to do so, but of course I care about the treatment of the animals before they become my food, as any normal human being would.</p>

Since their nutrition education program made multiple changes in the diet, it is not possible to ascribe the improvements to one or the other or perhaps both.  That&#39;s my point.  Hiding behind &quot;nutrition education program&quot; is disingenuous.</p>

<p>The claims of the Mediterranean diet being plant based is a just so story made up by people who want to discourage meat consumption.  Just like the myths about Okinawa based on surveys done in the 1950s after the Japanese slaughtered all their pigs (and a lot of the healthy younger people).  Italians and greeks ate pork and goat and lamb.  </p>

<p>Again you down play the major win of T2D not having high BG damaging their blood vessels and threatening their eyesight and kidneys, in favor of a very small gain in relative risk for CVD in which research is all over the map.   T2D and obesity are also risks for CVD.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not interested in the usual back and forth with you about LDL.  I made a specific point that this paper used multiple changes in their nutritional education program.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The part where they created and tested a hypothesis?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Did you actually read through these sources? Most of them are garbage. They claim vegans are deficient in B12, vitamin A and D ( most omnivores are deficient in vitamin D as well. Do omnivore diets make you deficient? ), Iron, Calcium, Zinc but their evidence is quite debatable. Studies find that vegans are deficient in some things (mostly Zinc and B12) while omnivores are deficient in other things such as B6 and fibre. If you manage your diet well you will avoid deficiencies, vegan or omnivore.</p>

<p>Most of the studies use a sample size of 20 to 100 people or just individual case reports, several of them didn&#39;t last more than a week, multiple studies don&#39;t control for factors such as BMI, multiple studies use raw vegans or vegetarians and even more don&#39;t even use plant based people, almost NONE of the studies use the word deficient but are presented as evidence of deficiency. Overall the posts are horribly formatted and use the same studies over and over again, and many of those studies actually prove the opposite of what they are trying to state. </p>

<p>Many studies use zero citations for their claims, like the very first &quot;proof&quot; which is an article that keeps mentioning figures from a study without ever actually referencing it. </p>

<p>The creatine study they linked also found improvements for omnivores. Quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Irrespective of dietary style, the supplementation of creatine decreased the variability in the responses to a choice reaction-time task.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does this prove vegans are deficient in creatine and suffer from poor memory?</p>

<p>The CoQ10 study results are that in 60 men eating a standard diet, supplements increased serum levels of CoQ10? What does this have to do with vegans?</p>

<p>Many studies have found deficiencies in omnivores, do you also claim an omnivore diet makes you nutrient deficient? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I evolved eating animals, so I&#39;ll continue to do so</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such a weak argument, just like all the other science you have presented. Typical anti-vegan science though. Why don&#39;t you focus on other health aspects such as prevention and reversal of cardio-vascular disease, lower cancer rates, lower diabetes, lower BMI, higher longevity etc. The least that you can give me with the science we have is that vegans are as well off as health conscious omnivores in regards of their diet.</p>

<p>When did this become about diabetes? Plant based diets improve insulin sensitivity and reverse the underlying cause of T2DM while lowering cholesterol levels which is needed to reverse atherosclerosis. You’re the one ignoring the #1 cause of death </p>

<p>Kempner reversed diabetic retinopathy using a diet of pure carbs and sugar. Keto nor animal products are necessary </p>

<div class="md"><p>Really, where did they do that?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Fiber is not essential.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>There are zero clinical studies by Kempner.  His diet was a boredom diet in which people fasted because rice and fruit were boring, plus the calories were set to below maintenance.  We all know fasting is beneficial even if the small amount of food consumed has carbs (as in very low calorie diets).  Stop quoting him like there is valid research there.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The results for &quot;WFPB&quot; and T2D are worse than the results for keto [edit: but still absolutely an improvement].  The results for &quot;WFPB&quot; I have not seen shown in the context of CVD, this study conflated BOTH reduction in processed foods AND reduction in animal products and that weakness prevents a clear assertion of association even.</p>

<p>The minimal increase in relative risk for CVD due to normal or high LDL is being hotly contested with studies right now. It&#39;s far from decided science.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30198808">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30198808</a></p>

<p>High fibre consumption was linked with decrease in all-cause and cardiovascular related mortality, and incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke incidence and mortality, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer, as well as significantly lower bodyweight, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on the carnivore diet (specifically PKD) and no studies exist on carnivore diets.</p>

<p>Fiber maybe helpful on other diets but on carnivore anecdotally people do much better without it.</p>

<p>Checkout Dr. Paul Mason&#39;s conclusions on fiber.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that being on a carnivore diet changes much, your gut bacteria still need some fiber to stay alive, but as you said the science still isn&#39;t there on carnivore diets specifically. I am also aware that some people have issues digesting lots of fiber and those people seem to thrive on an animal based diet. I will look up the person you referenced, thanks for the recommendation.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary human brain tumour that has resisted effective therapy for decades. Although glucose and glutamine are the major fuels that drive GBM growth and invasion, few studies have targeted these fuels for therapeutic management. The glutamine antagonist, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), was administered together with a calorically restricted ketogenic diet (KD-R) to treat late-stage orthotopic growth in two syngeneic GBM mouse models: VM-M3 and CT-2A. DON targets glutaminolysis, while the KD-R reduces glucose and, simultaneously, elevates neuroprotective and non-fermentable ketone bodies. The diet/drug therapeutic strategy killed tumour cells while reversing disease symptoms, and improving overall mouse survival. The therapeutic strategy also reduces edema, hemorrhage, and inflammation. Moreover, the KD-R diet facilitated DON delivery to the brain and allowed a lower dosage to achieve therapeutic effect. The findings support the importance of glucose and glutamine in driving GBM growth and provide a therapeutic strategy for non-toxic metabolic management.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to add more omega3&#39;s into my diet, and obviously I will be eating fish but flaxseeds have come up in alot of conversations. I did some digging and I find alot of websites saying &quot;Its amazing for omega 3&quot; and I&#39;ve heard some research say that it&#39;s either &quot;an insignificant source&quot; or even &quot;your body cant absorb a substantial amount from flaxseed&quot;  </p>

<p>Both views cited sources, so I&#39;m a bit confused if it&#39;s just mom science Ellen DeGeneres seed of the month, or if its actually rooted in science.</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>The omega-3 fat in flaxseeds is ALA, and while only premenopausal women can convert meaningful amounts to long chain EPA and DHA, ALA itself may have health benefits.</p>

<p>Pan et al, 2012. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/96/6/1262/4571434">α-Linolenic acid and risk of cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis</a>. <em>Am J Clin Nut</em>, <em>96</em>(6), pp.1262-1273.</p>

<p>The main benefit from flaxseed, however, isn&#39;t the ALA, but the cancer protective lignans. Eg:</p>

<p>Alphonse and Aluko., 2015. <a href="https://phytomedicine.ejournals.ca/index.php/phytomedicine/article/viewFile/24/60">A review on the anti-carcinogenic and anti-metastatic effects of flax seed lignan secolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG)</a>. <em>phytomedicine</em>, <em>2</em>(2015), p.6. </p>

<p>Flower et al, 2014. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1534735413502076">Flax and breast cancer: A systematic review</a>. <em>Integrative cancer therapies</em>, <em>13</em>(3), pp.181-192.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Aside from the ALA, which has been discussed, I like flax since it is very high in mineral density, and has all essential amino acids.  Also, somewhat unusually for seeds, it is low in oxalate and lectins, which can cause health issues in some people.  It&#39;s also quite inexpensive.  I don&#39;t know of any downsides to taking a couple of tablespoons of ground flax every day.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>look into ALA vs EPA/DHA and the human ability to absorb omega 3 in either form. ALA is what&#39;s present in plant sources and even in grass-fed red meats almost exclusively and absorbed so badly it&#39;s indeed insignificant (see study links by golden eagle below for ALA absorption).</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>EPA and particularly DHA are the main fatty acids present in the brain and Retina... If most people are such poor converters of ALA, then how did societies with no sea food in their diets get enough EPA and DHA?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It seems your statement </p>

<p>“while only premenopausal women can convert meaningful amounts to long chain EPA and DHA”</p>

<p>is incorrect when considering the following sources. </p>

<p><em>Is docosahexaenoic acid synthesis from α-linolenic acid sufficient to supply the adult brain?</em></p>

<p>“Debate exists as to whether DHA synthesized from ALA can provide sufficient DHA for the adult brain, as measures of DHA synthesis from ingested ALA are typically &lt;1% of the oral ALA dose. However, the primary fate of orally administered ALA is β-oxidation and long-term storage in adipose tissue, suggesting that DHA synthesis measures involving oral ALA tracer ingestion may underestimate total DHA synthesis. There is also evidence that DHA synthesized from ALA can meet brain DHA requirements, as animals fed ALA-only diets have brain DHA concentrations similar to DHA-fed animals, and the brain DHA requirement is estimated to be only 2.4-3.8 mg/day in humans. This review summarizes evidence that DHA synthesis from ALA can provide sufficient DHA for the adult brain by examining work in humans and animals involving estimates of DHA synthesis and brain DHA requirements. Also, an update on methods to measure DHA synthesis in humans is presented highlighting a novel approach involving steady-state infusion of stable isotope-labeled ALA that bypasses several limitations of oral tracer ingestion. It is shown that this method produces estimates of DHA synthesis that are at least 3-fold higher than brain uptake rates in rats.”

<p>I’m the following study vegans had higher serum ALA, EPA, and total long chain n-3s, equal DPA but lower DHA than fish eaters while consuming half has much total n-3s. This suggests conversion rates fluctuate as needed.</p>

<p>What exactly are you doing on this subreddit if this is your approach to nutrition?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Why do you say it is insignificant?
It might not be optimal (you did Not provide sources for that claim either) but insignificant seems to be untrue.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Omega 3 in beef is about 20-50% EPA &amp; DHA according to the sources I&#39;ve seen.  Also, ALA is converted to EPA/DHA at a rate between 2 and 9%, depending on the individual.  It&#39;s not an insignificant source considering that a few tablespoons of flax has a huge amount of ALA.  Some populations, like Native Americans, tend to be poor converters of ALA.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The thing is all those requirements are supposed to be for optimal health and longevity. You can live a lot without meeting them completely. </p>

<p>Plus, back in the day, there were much less processed food, which might disturb the Omega 3/6 ratio. Might.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Simple, they lived untill the ripe old age of &quot;died in childbirth&quot;<br/>
One of the huge reasons for our longevity in modern society is our access to all kinds of nutrition. Living until dementia and cancer age is a fairly new thing, not to say that it didn&#39;t happen but it wasn&#39;t the norm that&#39;s for sure.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Brains and eyes do most of their development in the womb. Not only do premenopausal women convert the best, but they store DHA and EPA in body fat and convert even more during pregnancy and breastfeeding.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is the only nutrition sub on reddit where science still reigns  so I don&#39;t want to drag it down by debating what constitutes &#39;significant&#39; etc. I hope we can agree that actual sources of EPA &amp; DHA are preferable for these nutrients than a 2-9% conversion via ALA.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Source?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Did that study not measure their baseline plasma DHA levels? Perhaps they didn’t convert any ALA to DHA because they already had sufficient levels. There’s evidence that the conversion rate fluctuates as needed. From Table 5 of the EPIC study I cited</p>

<p>Fish-eater: EPA intake: 0.18 ± 0.22 g/d Serum EPA: 239.7 ± 106.2 umol/L</p>

<p>Meat-eater: EPA intake: 0.02 ± 0.02 g/d Serum EPA: 215.6 ± 96.4 umol/L</p>

<p>Vegetarian: EPA intake: 0.002 ±  0.007  g/d Serum EPA: 222.2 ± 138.4 umol/L</p>

<p>Vegan: EPA intake:  0 g/d Serum EPA: 195.0 ± 58.8 umol/L</p>

<p>Clearly since the male vegans had similar values (with a lower standard deviation) we can synthesize DHA from ALA. If we were not able to synthesize DHA from ALA the vegans would have had very low levels</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fine with that. Next time thought if you directly answer OP and make a claim we ask that people use reference(s). It makes it easier to engage the claim and gives further reading material to the others. Thanks!</p>

<p>With a 4% conversion rate a single serving of flax seeds would give you the recommended daily amount of omega 3. I am not denying that fish and roe are amazing sources of omega 3, but simply dismissing actual science for soyboy propaganda is laughable.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I got my information from the study in your second link.  I agree that absolute values are very low compared to seafood.  I was just pointing out that the Omega 3 in beef is not almost all ALA.  I was also talking about EPA &amp; DHA combined, and EPA is often much more abundant in beef than DHA.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>If you compare ~80mg omega 3 per 100gr serving of beef, with 9% of 3000mg omega 3 per 15gr serving of flax, it&#39;s not that bad. (I just googled the numbers)</p>

<div class="md"><p>Of course baseline and post-measurement DHA values were taken (eg. table 2 of the first paper).</p>

<p>The intent of a isotope labeled feeding trial is to quantitatively determine the metabolic fates of a nutrient from its appearance in plasma (or biopsied tissue), exhaled breath, urine and feces.</p>

<p>The elongation and desaturation metabolic pathway may well be upregulated in vegans, but the focus of these two studies was to determine how much of a given dose of ALA was converted in young females and males with little consideration of their typical diet. All we know is they weren&#39;t habitual oily fish eaters. Presumably they were mostly on standard (omnivore) Western diets.</p>

<p>I think most of the RCTs on fish oil have had underwhelming results, with the exception of the ones studying cognitive decline. This suggests that there may be real benefits to supplementing with long-chain n-3 fats in the late middle aged and elderly. Personally, I take an algal EPA+DHA supplement, as I&#39;ve been a caretaker for someone with dementia and I&#39;ll take $100/yr insurance that may reduce that risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>those conversion rates are correct iirc:</p>

<p>100g of flax seed (~530 calories, serving [size] is a meaningless measure as you are very well aware) contain 22.8g of omega 3 as ALA, of which 4% are 900mg, which is still below the modern scientific nutritional recommendation (fuck antiquated RDA too, another meaningless measure) of 1.5-2g - not that any reasonable person would eat 100g of flax seeds a day anyways.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>true, but I hope noone claimed beef to be a good source of omega 3. there&#39;s really no good reason to look beyond fish for omega 3</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Vascepa is a pharmaceutical grade high dose of EPA which was shown to benefit cardiovascular disease. The study has it&#39;s problems but suggests supplemental EPA may be uniquely beneficial. Physicians can now prescribe it.<br/>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>But in the second paper on men where they state “ the capacity of adult males to convert ALNA to DHA was either very low or absent” there doesn’t appear to be baseline measurements. If they aren’t making DHA are their serum levels low? If not what does it matter? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure it’s an insurance policy though unless we know higher DHA is better than higher EPA and ALA. From the EPIC study I cited vegans ate less ALA and no EPA or DHA  but had higher plasma levels of ALA and EPA, similar DPA and lower DHA.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The FDA serving size is 30 grams actually. Most scientific organisations actually recommend 1-2 grams of omega 3 per day, with at least 0.25-0.5 grams coming from DHA+EPA. This recommendation is made by the world health organisation:</p>

<p>30 grams of flax seeds give you 7 grams of omega 3 and 0.28 grams of DHA and 0.42 grams of EPA. This gives us a combined 0.8 grams of EPA + DHA which is well over the RDA recommended by dozens of national and international health authorities.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I appreciate the dialogue between you two. It&#39;s becoming pretty clear that you should not be trusting flax seed for your daily omega 3 at the moment as there&#39;s alot of conflicting arguments currently.

<div class="md"><p>This is a controversial/debatable opinion but I put more trust in nutritional scientists like Rhonda Patrick (one of the few without a product/agenda to sell) and &#39;optimal&#39; rather than &#39;minimal&#39; RDA&#39;s. Take Vitamin D for example, the RDA has been shown time and time again to be insufficient in maintaining adequate levels depending on country/season, and insufficient in getting deficient levels into range - the same I would argue applies for many macro- and micronutrients and other aspects of nutrition.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care so much for having clients not sick/in immediate need of meds but to optimize their health, bloodwork, life quality and longetivity. That said, if you go by RDA&#39;s and the listed organizations (get your whole grains and plant fats and low fat milk products in, here&#39;s some overpriced insulin and statins to supplement the future effects of the food pyramid), you are absolutely correct, I can&#39;t argue with that, so let&#39;s leave it at that.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>You can get adequate omega 3 from flax seed as I mentioned below. I do agree that oily fish is a great source of nutrition including omega 3. I would stick to smaller fish, as stated in a great comment made on this subreddit recently:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For health concerns, I would avoid fish at higher trophic levels, and with higher methylmercury and persistent organic pollutant content, like Chilean bass, bluefish, grouper, lingcod, mackerel, marlin, orange roughy, pike, shark, swordfish, tilefish, most trout, tuna, and weakfish. The preferred lower methylmercury seafood would be clams, cod, herring, mullet, mussels, oyster, salmon, sardine, scallops, shad, shrimp, sole, squid, tilapia, and farmed trout.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>at least flax seed isn&#39;t as high as many other plant fats in inflammatory omega 6&#39;s and thus doesn&#39;t contribute to a worse o3:o6 ratio like most other plant-based fats.</p>

<p>salmon has problems of its own but I&#39;d argue small fatty fish are indeed the only decent source of omega 3 humans have</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>We actually agree on most topics, I think Rhonda is a great source for nutrition advice as well. We agree on avoiding oil and decreasing omega 6 consumption, vit D, fish being good for you etc.</p>

<p>Many nutritional scientists recommend a plant based diet, many recommend an omnivore diet. I think you are a bit biased in your view towards plant based nutrition and that could cloud your judgement in the long run. A whole foods plant based diet has been proven in multiple studies to help curing diabetes and high cholesterol, no need for statins and insulin. You don&#39;t need to include grains either if you don&#39;t like them. A whole foods diet that includes some meat is also healthy and surely less complicated than a purely vegan diet, we can also agree on that I suppose. Good luck man.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not aware of any plant-based diet studies that claim reversal of type II diabetes. The ones I&#39;ve seen have only shown moderate improvements - 0.25 - 0.34% - in HbA1c. </p>

<p>Do you know of one that shows reversal?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>you&#39;re correct - working in nutrition I&#39;ve seen dozens of bloodwork of clients I ordered myself on various diets I prescribed myself, so I&#39;ve come to hate the word plant-based, as plants are as diverse in their nutrition as animals are. personally I eat 2-4kg of meat/fish a day (grass-fed beef, game, goat, lamb, nose to tail (offal, bone marrow etc.), salmon, mackerel, trout mostly) and my trigs just came back at 28 with cholesterol at 115 and everything else in range and as desired/predicted. both carnivores and herbivores that try to hide their shitty bloodwork under the table and can&#39;t perform athletically at a certain level can fuck off, you are what you eat really holds true when put to the test(s) imo.</p>

<p>leafy greens and sweet potatoes and dark berries are absolutely great additions of course! I personally prefer/prescribe an &#39;ancestral/animal-based&#39; omnivore diet with really high nutrient density/nutrient bioavailability.</p>

<p>as for dietary approaches for diabetes and high cholesterol, I find that more of a matter of elimination than inclusion of certain foods. I&#39;m confident even a carnivore diet (famous for shit cholesterol but ketogenic diets are decent for insulin resistance/diabetes) can be designed around high quality foods (the carnivores/zc people on reddit are trash and eat grocery store trash meats from diseased animals and hey, you are what you eat may apply to your food as well) to produce decent cholesterol levels as well.</p>

<p>sorry for rambling, I&#39;m super passionate about nutritional science!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Depending on your definition of the word &#39;&#39;cured&#39;&#39;, all the way back in 1934 Walter Kepner used a very low fat vegan diet (nicknamed the rice diet) to cure diabetes. Here is one of his many studies:</p>

<p>These studies demonstrate people coming off their diabetes medication and eliminating the symptoms of the disease. If they change their diet however their diabetes will return (similar to the keto diet I guess). It is debatable whether or not this is an actual cure I suppose.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I am actually really glad we had this little debate, I assumed you were one of those clueless carnivores on reddit based on your soyboy propaganda comment. We agree on nearly every point though, berries and sweet potatoes are great, leafy greens are good as well although you could pick low oxalate ones if you worry about that. </p>

<p>You are obviously way more active (or just bigger) than I am if you eat 4kg of meat per day and presumably stay lean, I consume around 3500 calories daily atm. I try to limit my meat intake to fatty fish and mussels though since I have no reliable source of high quality meat. My ldl hovers around 60, all other blood work normal, and I actually saw way worse blood work while eating processed carbs and oil. Whole foods are the answer.</p>

<p>We also seem to agree than high cholesterol is an issue for many carnivores and they often deny it. There are many plant based people as well that eat a shitty diet with no real nutrients and their blood work shows it but they are so far up their own ass they can&#39;t admit it. Simply going vegan will not help with anything, you have to actually put in some work.</p>

<p>Again, great talking to you man, glad we actually came to an agreement.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Sigh. One study would serve if it were a good one.</p>

<p>I&#39;m always confused when people reference Kepner. First off, I don&#39;t think his diet is even close to what WFPB diets would recommend, and second, if you look at his data (see table 1 in the link you send me), it&#39;s not even close to a cure. There is still a lot of insulin used on the diet and the reduction in fasting glucose was from 202 to 155. I think under today&#39;s standards, a fasting glucose of 155 is going to be considered quite diabetic. </p>

<p>If you&#39;d like me to comment on Pritikin and Barnard, please choose a single study. </p>

<p>Looking at the newer studies:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first one is a review rather than a study, and talks about prevention and treatment, not reversal. </p></li>
<li><p>The second one talks about reversal in the title, but digging in they are only showing a reduction in post-prandial blood glucose. That is definitely better, but the studies talking about reversal typically look at HbA1c and HOMO-IR as they are more definitive. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Or, to put it another way, you may see a big reduction in postprandial glucose merely by reducing the glycemic load of meals. Will that get rid of the chronic hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia? We don&#39;t know as they didn&#39;t do those measures.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The third one is another review paper.</p></li>
<li><p>The last one repeats the pattern that I typically see. They took a group with an HbA1c of 7.6 and reduced it to 6.9. Which is certainly a good thing, but they are still diabetic at the end of the study. Which is why the trial say &quot;improved insulin resistance&quot; rather than talking about reversal. They also kept medications in place except when there was hypoglycemia. And note that this is in comparison with a conventional diabetes diet, which generally produce awful results.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think WFPB is likely pretty good at diabetes prevention as long as the sugar amount is reasonable. It might actually work for reversal, but I&#39;ve seen no evidence of the kind of results that are seen with gastric bypass, very-low-calorie diets (&lt;800 cal/day), or the Virta health keto approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>How do you manage to eat 3500 kcal daily while limiting meat, oil and processed carbs? I&#39;m really struggling with this.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I like to eat I guess. I can put down a lot of food and I always struggled with satiety until I started eating more whole plant foods. I actually practice intermittent fasting as well and my eating window is 8 hours. I routinely eat a large can of sardines plus a kg of legumes plus half a kg of some other vegetable for lunch with no issues. </p>

<p>If you struggle with low appetite I would recommend increasing your nuts and seeds consumption (or whole food nut butters) since they are very calorie dense. Look up soaking them appropriately if you wish to include a lot of them in your diet. </p>

<p>Other good calorie dense foods are some fruits like avocados, dates ( a single date has like 30 calories ) and especially dried fruit. Another good tactic is blending up some fruits and plant milk/water (maybe even some whole cocoa powder, it&#39;s very calorie dense) into a smoothie. Drinking your calories is a very easy way to ingest a lot of them. I find it very easy to eat lots of starchy vegetables such as rice, potatoes, corn or whole grains but some people have issues with those. I am just throwing ideas of the top of my head, maybe some of them will be helpful to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The body requires iodine to metabolize both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. A substance called delta-iodolactone, a derivative of arachidonic acid</strong>, which is produced in the thyroid gland and breast tissue, prostate, colon, and the nervous system, is a regulator of a process called cellular apoptosis (&quot;cell death&quot;). Ascorbic acid is required to stimulate intracellular hydrogen peroxide synthesis that, in turn, provides the energy to make iodine free radicals necessary for this reaction. When the level of delta-iodolactone is high enough, the process of apoptosis can then kill cancer cells.(15)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for iodine - about 150 mcg per day - will not allow delta-iodolactone to be efficiently formed in the thyroid gland. <strong>The thyroid requires higher iodine concentrations to efficiently produce it. Researchers have found that 100 times the RDA amount of iodine is optimal to produce delta-iodolactone.</strong> That equates to taking about 15 mg of iodine per day (15,16). These findings are important because they imply that there are some biochemical reactions that require much larger amounts of iodine than the current RDA. The mechanism by which delta-iodolactone induces cell death may be an important pathway for curing some types of cancer.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>An iodinated derivative of arachidonic acid, 5-hydroxy-6-iodo-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid, δ-lactone (6-IL) has been implicated as a possible intermediate in the autoregulation of the thyroid gland by iodine. In addition to antiproliferative and apoptotic effects observed in thyrocytes, this iodolipid could also exert similar actions in cells derived from extrathyroidal tissues like mammary gland, prostate, colon, or the nervous system. In mammary cancer (solid tumors or tumor cell lines), 6-IL has been detected after molecular iodine (I2) supplement, and is a potent activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma (PPARγ). These observations led us to propose I2 supplement as a novel coadjutant therapy which, by inducing differentiation mechanisms, decreases tumor progression and prevents chemoresistance. Some kinds of tumoral cells, in contrast to normal cells, contain high concentrations of arachidonic acid, making the I2 supplement a potential “magic bullet” that enables local, specific production of 6-IL, which then exerts antineoplastic actions with minimal deleterious effects on normal tissues.</p>

<p>...</p>

<ol>
<li>Toward clinical application</li>
</ol>

<p>There are few studies about 6-IL transport and stability in vivo. Reports of Pisarev&#39;s group show that intraperitoneal or oral administration of 6-IL, 5–10 μg over a period of 10 days exerts a significant antigoitrogenic action without detrimental effects on thyroidal or general metabolism (no change in urea, acetylcholinesterase activity, cholesterol, total protein, and total T3 and T4) [58], [61], [62]. Similarly, the i.p. injection of 6-IL (15 μg/day for 30 days) reduces the growth of HT-29 cell xenografts on NIH nude mice [89]; however, the pharmacodynamic distribution, diffusion mechanisms, and/or the tissues that preferentially take up 6-IL have not been determined. In contrast, iodine circulation and its tissue-specific uptake have been well studied at concentrations including antitumoral doses, and no harmful effects on thyroidal or general physiology were observed [91], [92], [93], [94], [95]. Moreover, long-term (3–8 months) 5 mg/day I2 supplements, a dose similar to the intake of the eastern populations of Japan [1], [96], have been shown to be safe for treatment of human mammary fibrocystic disease [97], [98], breast cancer,1 or prostate hyperplasia.2 Thus, the preferentially local formation of 6-IL in proliferating [65] or neoplastic tissues [72] from organs capable of iodine uptake, together with its lack of damage to normal tissues allows I2 supplement to be considered a good example of the “magic bullet” concept. Paul Ehrlich inspired this term over one hundred years ago for the arsenic derivatives used against syphilis [99], [100]; since then this notion has inspired generations of scientists to devise powerful and selective molecular cancer chemotherapeutics. The prime requirements for a ‘magic bullet’ are that it has high selectivity for a therapeutic target and it is innocuous toward the patient&#39;s normal cells [99], [100]. In search of these ‘magic bullets’ a broad range of chemotherapeutics has been explored, including antibodies, liposomes, immunoliposomes, and nanomaterials [101], [102], [103], but in all instances, overcoming the side effects is a hard experimental and clinical obstacle. Thus, the ability of certain organs to take up iodine together with high arachidonic acid concentration in pathological tissues like mammary [104], [105], [106], [107], [108] and prostate cancers [109], [110] makes molecular iodine a magic bullet that acts through the formation of specific effector compounds like 6-IL.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Objective: We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials that tested the association of vitamin D supplementation with reduced CVD events and all-cause mortality.</p>

<p>Study Selection: Inclusion criteria were <strong>randomized clinical trials that reported the effect of long-term (≥1 year) vitamin D supplementation on CVD events and all-cause mortality.</strong> Studies that did not include cardiovascular outcomes were excluded.</p>

<p>Main Outcomes and Measures: Major adverse cardiovascular events was the primary outcome, and rates of myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebrovascular accident, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality were the secondary end points.</p>

<p>Results: <strong>Twenty-one randomized clinical trials were included</strong> (including 83 291 patients, of whom 41 669 received vitamin D and 41 622 received placebos). The mean (SD) age of trial participants was 65.8 (8.4) years; 61 943 (74.4%) were female. Only 4 trials had prespecified CVD as a primary end point. <strong>Vitamin D supplementation compared with placebo was not associated with reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.95-1.06]; P = .85) nor the secondary end points of myocardial infarction (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.93-1.08]; P = .92), stroke (RR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.98-1.15]; P = .16), CVD mortality (RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.90-1.07]; P = .68), or all-cause mortality (RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.93-1.02]; P = .23). Results were generally consistent by sex, baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, vitamin D dosage, formulation (daily vs bolus dosing), and presence or absence of concurrent calcium administration.</strong></p>

<p>Conclusions and Relevance: In this updated meta-analysis, <strong>vitamin D supplementation was not associated with reduced major adverse cardiovascular events, individual CVD end points (myocardial infarction, stroke, CVD mortality), or all-cause mortality. The findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation does not confer cardiovascular protection and is not indicated for this purpose.</strong></p>

<p>Dr Manson received funding from the US National Institutes of Health to conduct the Vitamin D and ω-3 Trial(VITAL). Vitamin D study pills were donated by Pharmavite LLC and Omega-3 supplements were donated by Pronova Bio Pharma and BASF. No other disclosures were reported.</p>

<p>The more I read about the recent failures of vitamin D supplementation, the more I lean towards the idea that low serum D is just a proxy for too little sun exposure.  You can fix the D levels with a pill but perhaps that only fixes a small part of the negative health impacts that result from not getting enough sun.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>until praying to solar dieties for more sunlight in all seasons is improved, supplementation fixed winter depression/lethargy very noticeably at least.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Plus, sun exposure may also mean increased physical activity and the stress reduction that comes from spending time outside.</p>

<p>Yeah I really don&#39;t know.  Unfortunately there hasn&#39;t been much interest in quantifying which metrics of sun exposure are &#39;useful&#39; versus extraneous.  My suspicion is that all wavelengths provide some function since we know that blue light exposure has an impact and UVA/UVB both impact D status and melanoma risk differently, and that covers quite a bit of the spectrum already.  If you are interested, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897598/">this paper</a> goes into great detail about wavelengths, sun exposure, D status, and health outcomes.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hmm, I&#39;m not sure what you mean by evidence?  We cannot have a trial with a &#39;no gravity&#39; control group so it&#39;s impossible to run an RCT, but gravity pulls on anything and everything with mass.  Since your body parts have mass, gravity is constantly pulling them downwards.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well astronauts are limited to 6-month intervals in space due to muscle wasting.  I think you would need many years in a non-gravity environment to be able to compare properly.  Remember that aging happens over decades, so seeing a significant change in 6 months would be a challenge I think.  Perhaps when Mars is colonized (40% of Earth gravity) then we will have interesting data like that!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dyslipidemia is a global health problem and a high risk factor for atherosclerosis, which can lead to serious cardiovascular disease (CVD). Existing studies have shown inconsistent effects of turmeric and curcuminoids on blood lipids in adults. We performed this <strong>systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of turmeric and curcuminoids on blood triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol.</strong> We searched the English databases of the Web of Science, PubMed, Ovid (including EMBASE and MEDLINE), Scopus, and the Cochrane Library and 2 Chinese databases, Wanfang Data and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that studied the effects of turmeric and curcuminoids on blood TG, TC, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol in subjects with metabolic diseases. With random-effects models,separate meta-analyses were conducted by using inverse-variance. The results are presented as the mean difference with 95% CIs. <strong>Evidence from 12 RCTs for TG, 14 RCTs for TC, 13 RCTs for LDL cholesterol, and 16 RCTs for HDL cholesterol showed that turmeric and curcuminoids could lower blood TG by−19.1 mg/dL (95% CI:−31.7,−6.46 mg/dL;P=0.003), TC by−11.4 mg/dL (95% CI:−17.1,−5.74 mg/dL;P&lt;0.0001), and LDL cholesterol by−9.83 mg/dL (95% CI:−15.9,−3.74 mg/dL;P=0.002), and increase HDL cholesterol by 1.9 mg/dL (95% CI: 0.31, 3.49 mg/dL;P=0.02). In conclusion, turmeric and curcuminoids can significantly modulate blood lipids in adults with metabolic diseases. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously because of the significant heterogeneity between included studies (I2&gt;50%). There is a need for further RCTs in future.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No conflicts were declared.</p>

<p>From the discussion about the large heretogeneity and subgroup analyses:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was proven that <strong>intervention dose and period are the main sources of heterogeneity for TG and HDL cholesterol, while morbid state was closely related to the source of heterogeneity for TC</strong> by meta-regressions in our study(P&lt;0.05). Consequently, we conducted 3 subgroup analyses to determine the sources of heterogeneity. There were 4 subgroups of intervention periods (4 wk, 8 wk, 12 wk, and 24 wk subgroups). Turmeric and curcumin had no effect on any lipid in the 4 wk subgroup, and demonstrated no effect on HDL cholesterol in the 8 wk subgroup. <strong>These results implied that the efficacy of turmeric and curcumin would be strengthened by increasing the treatment period to ≥8wk.</strong> In addition, the heterogeneities for TG in all time-subgroups decreased significantly, even to 0%, in the 4 wk and 8 wk subgroups. Furthermore, when we eliminated 1 study from the 12 wk subgroup (41), the I2 value decreased from 48% to 0%, but the pooled outcome in this subgroup was not altered. These findings might explain that the different baseline TG concentrations were 1 of the sources of heterogeneity. The heterogeneity for HDL cholesterol mainly came from the 8wk and 12wk subgroups, with the I2 values of 53% and 44%, respectively. After removing 1 study from the 8 wk subgroup and another study from the 12 wk subgroup, the heterogeneities decreased from 53% and 44% to 0% in the 8 wk and 12 wk subgroups, respectively. These results might be attributed to the highest doses in the 2 trials in both subgroups. In the subgroup of dose of curcumin, the heterogeneities for TG in both the high-dose and low-dose groups were still significant. However, the heterogeneity of the high-dose subgroup abated from 77% to 36% after removing 1 trial without changing the overall effect, and the heterogeneity of the low-dose subgroup decreased from 43% to 8% after omitting 1 study, while the pooled effect showed no significant difference.The heterogeneities for HDL cholesterol were 82% in the high-dose subgroup and 0% in the low-dose subgroup. The I2 value for the high-dose subgroup decreased to 33% when 2 trials were eliminated. These results might confirm that the intervention time and dose of curcumin were the main sources of heterogeneity for TG and HDL cholesterol between the treatment and control groups. When we removed 2 studies, the heterogeneity values for TC dropped markedly from 39% and 43% to 0% in the high-dose and low-dose subgroups, respectively. As a result, the overall heterogeneity of TC decreased from 48% to 0%, and the pooled result did not change. </p>

<p>For the subgroup analysis of physiological status, the number of trials that involved people with pre-diabetes, overweight, obesity, MetS, hyperlipidemia,and NAFLD was too small to conduct subgroup-analysis. Consequently, we only formed the subgroups of subjects with T2DM or non-T2DM (e.g., prediabetes, overweight, obesity, MetS, hyperlipidemia, and NAFLD). The heterogeneities were 84%, 46%, 51%, and 77% in the T2DM subgroup and 15%, 58%, 83%, and 53% in the non-T2DM subgroup for TG, TC, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol, respectively.</p>

<p>After removing 1 trial in which the intervention period was much longer than those of the other trials (40), the heterogeneities significantly declined to 69%, 0%, 5%, and 38% for TG, TC, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol in the T2DM subgroup, respectively. However, in the non-T2DM subgroup, the I2 value for TC decreased from 58% to 0% by omitting 1 arm. The reason was that <strong>the subjects with NAFLD had been proven to be the main source of heterogeneity for TC by meta-regression analysis. Taken together, the heterogeneities of TG, TC, and HDL cholesterol mainly came from the intervention period, dose of curcuminoids between trials, and the underlying disease.</strong></p>

<div class="md"><p>So we&#39;re finally getting a protein (140g vs 150g) and calorie matched study showing that lower carbohydrate diet improve metabolic syndrome independent of weight loss. The high carbs group got a mean 25g of fibers which is not <em>too</em> bad - yet still could be better. I&#39;d be curious to see a daily menu. It also was a crossover study. Still need to read the full paper in details but this looks like a rather well done trial.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>BACKGROUND. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is highly correlated with obesity and cardiovascular risk, but the importance of dietary carbohydrate independent of weight loss in MetS treatment remains controversial. Here, we test the theory that dietary carbohydrate intolerance (i.e., the inability to process carbohydrate in a healthy manner) rather than obesity per se is a fundamental feature of MetS.</p>

<p>METHODS. Individuals who were obese with a diagnosis of MetS were fed three 4-week weight-maintenance diets that were low, moderate, and high in carbohydrate. Protein was constant and fat was exchanged isocalorically for carbohydrate across all diets.</p>

<p>RESULTS. Despite maintaining body mass, low-carbohydrate (LC) intake enhanced fat oxidation and was more effective in reversing MetS, especially high triglycerides, low HDL-C, and the small LDL subclass phenotype. Carbohydrate restriction also improved abnormal fatty acid composition, an emerging MetS feature. Despite containing 2.5 times more saturated fat than the high-carbohydrate diet, an LC diet decreased plasma total saturated fat and palmitoleate and increased arachidonate.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION. Consistent with the perspective that MetS is a pathologic state that manifests as dietary carbohydrate intolerance, these results show that compared with eucaloric high-carbohydrate intake, LC/high-fat diets benefit MetS independent of whole-body or fat mass.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>That is nicely done; I especially applaud the graphs that show all participants rather than just the averages and the error bars.</p>

<p>I find the triglyceride reduction particularly striking.</p>

<p><a href="https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/128308/sd/1">Here</a> is a daily sample.  Unfortunately the high-carb diet was pretty bad.  Life cereal and OJ for breakfast, grape juice and pretzels for a snack, marshmallow fluff and cheddar cheese at lunch, etc.  A total of 345g carbs of which <em>nearly half</em> were sugar and with only 25 g fiber?  It&#39;s unsurprising they performed poorly.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks, I did not take the time to read the paper in full before posting it. That&#39;s a pretty standard ultra-processed high-carb diet then. Not even 4g of fibers at breakfast. While I&#39;m glad we finally have a eucaloric protein-matched study with a seemingly good design, this study still fails to answer which diet is better between a high-carb, whole-food plant based diet vs a low-carb whole food diet. </p>

<p>Another point of interest is that study confirms once again that <del>weight loss</del> body fat % was the same regardless of carbs content.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Wait, why is it unsurprising?</p>

<p>The prevailing viewpoint is that metabolic syndrome, driven by insulin resistance, comes from an energy surplus, no matter where those calories come from. And there&#39;s plenty of evidence that weight loss improves insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in general regardless of the diet.</p>

<p>A calorie is a calorie. Or isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually cautious about this study given what I&#39;ve seen thus far, the evidence for the energy surplus is pretty solid, what I&#39;m questioning is your logic.</p>

<p>So what make simple carbohydrates special?I&#39;m not saying that they aren&#39;t, but if it&#39;s due to the insulin, then the study has a pretty good outcome. And if it&#39;s due to other issues like gut health, that&#39;s fine, but gut health right now is the conspiracy theory of nutrition.</p>

<p>Seriously, in this context the fiber is irrelevant and I don&#39;t think you can make any case for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thank you for pointing this out!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And even once we have one it will likely be done by either a pro-vegan or pro-keto group and will likely have similar biases or methodological limitations. :/</p>

<p>My current thinking is that fiber is a great mediator of results on these dietary plans.  High fiber is useful on high-carb diets because it helps slow absorption of starches and sugars and reduces the insulin impacts of high carb consumption.  Conversely, fiber is also useful in high-fat diets since it helps to absorb/resorb cholesterol and fatty acids in the gut, thereby reducing the potential cholesterol-raising impacts of a high-fat diet.  I would love to see a trial between two whole-food keto diets, one with 20g fiber and one with 60g fiber.  I think the outcomes would look rather different.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it was looking at WFPB though, rather SAD vs isocaloric low-carb without weight loss.  I would be interested in WFNK (whole foods nutritional ketosis) and WFPB comparison groups in a study for sure.</p>

<p>There wasn&#39;t weight loss.  &quot;All controlled diets were formulated to consist of the same total  calories to maintain weight stability throughout the entire experimental  period.&quot;</p>

<p>It was interesting that the LC diet was so high in sat fat, I wonder if they did that intentionally.  The changes in blood lipids were positive.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well I would rather we phrase it as hyperinsulinemia but the discussion will be the same.  And there is no proven causal role for hyperinsulinemia leading to METS, rather it occurs concurrent with METS and so it is perhaps simply another symptom of caloric excess.  Or perhaps it is causal, but we just haven&#39;t been able to tease it out yet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A calorie is a calorie. Or isn&#39;t it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is, and it is not.  The physical unit of a calorie is of course always constant, but what our bodies do with calories from various foods, the efficiency at which those calories are digested, and the hormonal impacts that those calories have will all factor into a weight loss (or weight gain) regime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the evidence for the energy surplus is pretty solid</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s extremely solid.  I would argue that it is the core of nearly all metabolic dysfunction.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well that&#39;s exactly what we are trying to tease out.  Is it the fiber?  Is it the microbiome?  Is it the hormonal impacts?  The satiety?  The context of the modern lifestyle?  <em>For some reason</em> whole food carbohydrates do not lead to METS while refined carbohydrates do.  My current guess is that fiber has a significant impact, perhaps due to regulating insulin spikes after meals, perhaps due to increased satiety, perhaps due to positive feeding of gut microbiota, perhaps some other factors as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Hopefully it will be done by someone who&#39;s quite neutral.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Most likely. I actually see very little concern regarding a plant-based keto diet, although we still lack any long-term data on its health effect.</p>

<p>My (decades) experience with high-carb low-fat (Emphasis in traditional) mediterranean diet says otherwise (because i actually live here, unlike most of you) The high fiber from Vegetables, legumes, whole grains including home made high-fiber breads did absolutely nothing to either help me control my weight or to stop me become pre-diabetic. It was only when i stopped eating these foods (exluding leafy greens) that i&#39;ve finally managed to reverse these conditions and eliminate completely the pre-diabetic condition, lower my cholesterol and bring myself to the weight levels of my late teen years.</p>

<p>When it comes to diet there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot;, it&#39;s a highly individualised thing.</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing this out, I mispoke. I had body composition difference in mind. Body fat % did not differ from baseline on either diet. According to some, the simple fact of eating low-carb should result in fat loss, regardless of calorie content. </p>

<p>Another interesting thing is that HOMA-IR and insulin were worse on the medium carbs diet than on the high carb diet, although the difference were not significant. Actually the difference were not significant either between low and high carbs, although low-carb had the best trend.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Well yes and no.  I think the general finding of people on keto or low-carb is that they spontaneously eat less -- without much hunger or loss of satiety.  But they certainly have to eat less, metabolically how else do you get the body to draw on its bodyfat.  The obese subjects, in order to maintain weight, &quot;To maintain body mass, the average total energy intake was nearly 3,000  kcal/day with 1 subject requiring as much as 3,750 kcal/day&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, &quot;Insulin resistance estimated from fasting glucose and insulin measures  tended to be lower after the LC than the MC diet but was not different  from the HC diet (<a href="https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/128308#T2">Table 2</a>).&quot; </p>

<p>I do think it&#39;s a good study for comparing low-carb to SAD sort of diets, and showing benefits to low-carb outside of weight loss.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>That sub&#39;s definition sounds like it leans heavily towards carnivore, which is not what I have seen from Virta Health and other WFNK diets.  If you look at Sisson&#39;s &quot;Primal&quot; and don&#39;t include the whole food carbs like potatoes/ sweet potatoes he includes then you have WFNK basically.  I see nothing wrong with low-net-carb veggies as part of a diet.</p>

<p>I think this is the overall general consensus, even within most keto communites, but I still these kind of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/9j1xj2/keto_benefits_without_a_calorie_deficit/e6olkpi/?st=jx6glmsn&amp;sh=57e7f559">comment</a> sometime. I might be misunderstanding what this user says, but the claim is pretty straight forward. Some people do seem to think that keto put you in a special metabolic state where energy just vanish and the energy content of the diet don&#39;t matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the 2nd law of thermodynamics and that only applies to closed systems which the body isn&#39;t.  Of course total energy balance is going to matter in the large and abstract sense.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, keto does put you into a special metabolic state where the energy content of the diet does seem to be metabolized differently.  I mean it is different, with the ketosis and all, but more that appetite and satiety are not conscious processes and so to eat until you feel full and still lose bodyfat seems to be magic.  Particularly for people who had struggled with hunger doing &quot;CICO&quot; with a high percent of carbs, even if some of those are whole foods most are bread/pasta aka refined flour based.</p>

<p>On the flip side you have the people having 1-2c of nuts a day wondering why they stalled.  Stalled.  Isn&#39;t that interesting?  They don&#39;t gain weight but the body sure isn&#39;t needing to use its bodyfat!</p>

<p>(Ask me about why I only allow macadamia nuts on bike rides, ha.)</p>

</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>Trans fats are present in small quantities in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat#Presence_in_food">many fatty foods</a>.  Hydrogenation results in a very large quantity of trans fats but non-hydrogenated oils will still contain small amounts of trans fats naturally.  <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://aocs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1007/s11746-013-2234-z">This paper</a> lists an analysis of trans fats in various oils in Table 4.

<div class="md"><p>From reading the paper,it says all oils as containing small amount of transfat due to oxidation.Is this natural??</p>

<div class="md"><p>Butter naturally has small amounts of transfat. Wikipedia says about 4%.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your comment was removed from <a href="/r/ScientificNutrition">r/ScientificNutrition</a> because it didn&#39;t contribute to the discussion.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &#39;natural&#39; but yes, heating fats <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4609978/">generates trans fats</a> although the total quantity is rather small.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trans formation from cis configuration in unsaturated lipids is inevitable steps during autoxidation, which is one of basic lipid oxidation mechanisms. Autoxidation is known as a free radical chain reaction with initiation, propagation, and final steps. Initial step is a formation of lipid radicals (L•) by losing hydrogen atom from unsaturated lipid (LH). Double bonds in cis configuration are unstable and tend to form trans configuration, which is more stable form than cis form. The higher temperature accelerates the reaction rates of oxidation and the more trans fat is generated.</p>

<p>Among tested cooking methods, stir-frying procedure at 170℃ heating and continuous stirring process may accelerate the rates of lipid oxidation and formation of trans fat compared to other cooking procedures. However, the content of trans fat in vegetable oil after stir-frying process was far below the trans fat level compared to other food products like margarine made of partially hydrogenated oils. The content of trans fat in edible oils was so low and food label can be declared as ‘0’ trans fat based on the regulation of Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS). In case of edible oils, trans fat content below 2 g per 100 g oil can be declared as ‘0’ trans.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks
Do this also happen with saturated fat ??</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s from unsaturated fats due to their relatively low oxidative stability.  The trans fats that are found in animal fats are due to <a href="http://www.jlr.org/content/43/2/290.full">biohydrogenation</a> (gut microbes converting cis-unsaturated fats into trans-unsaturates).  If you are worried about trans fats generated during cooking, I would go for an oil high in mono-unsaturates like extra-virgin olive oil since the trans-fat quantity is near-zero and it&#39;s actually <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27015911">a good oil</a> for high-heat cooking since the polyphenols <a href="http://sci-hub.tw/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691510004941?via%3Dihub">protect it from oxidation</a>.  You could cook with animal fats like like ghee and butter since the saturated fat component is very heat stable but unfortunately the <em>cholesterol</em> in those fats is very susceptible to oxidation itself.  You can see it in studies of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jsfa.2740580216">ghee</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12747694">chicken breast</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Hah, thought so since saturated fats are stable.
Yes,I mainly use coconut oil and ghee and mustard /rice bran oil for pufa(linolenic ).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Fruit and vegetable carotenoids should have essentially the same digestive/absorptive pathways so the recommendation should be similar for both.</p>

<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/80/2/396/4690323">This study</a> found that 28g was better than 6g (which was better than 0g).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10702576">This study</a> states that 3-5 g is enough to maximize carotenoid absorption but those numbers seem low in the context of the other papers.</p>

<p>Based on these studies I would shoot for ~10-20g of fat per high-carotenoid meal if you want to maximize absorption.</p>

<p>Do you mean for yourself personally?  Because the concept of &#39;food combining&#39; has been rather well <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/food-combining">debunked</a> at this point.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I found this article quite bad with some logical fallacies. Definitely did not debunk anything, at least for me. Though i haven&#39;t come across studies supporting food combining, too. But here i&#39;m talking specifically on fruit and other foods, not amino acid combinations and such. I know it on myself that when i eat fruit with heavier food i get gassy and upset stomach, even when consumed close to each other. Of course it could be different with each person, also different with every kind of fruit, many factors. There&#39;s also a lot of info online recommending eating fruit alone, and ancient Ayurvedic medicine also suggests the same (which i trust more than modern doctors anyday). There&#39;s logic behind it with the different digestive requirements of simple sugars in fruit and those of proteins and fats which certainly may be a burden to the GI if combined, but again nothing concrete. But have you tried for example eating a melon with other food? Do you usually eat raw fruit with other foods without any effect?</p>

<div class="md"><p>BACKGROUND. Dietary changes have led to the growing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. A hallmark of both disorders is hepatic lipid accumulation, derived in part from increased de novo lipogenesis. Despite the popularity of high-protein diets for weight loss, the effect of dietary protein on de novo lipogenesis is poorly studied. We aimed to characterize the effect of dietary protein on de novo lipid synthesis.</p>

<p>METHODS. We use a 3-way crossover interventional study in healthy males to determine the effect of high-protein feeding on de novo lipogenesis, combined with in vitro models to determine the lipogenic effects of specific amino acids. The primary outcome was a change in de novo lipogenesis–associated triglycerides in response to protein feeding.</p>

<p>RESULTS. We demonstrate that high-protein feeding, rich in glutamate, increases de novo lipogenesis–associated triglycerides in plasma (1.5-fold compared with control; P &lt; 0.0001) and liver-derived very low-density lipoprotein particles (1.8-fold; P &lt; 0.0001) in samples from human subjects (n = 9 per group). In hepatocytes, we show that glutamate-derived carbon is incorporated into triglycerides via palmitate. In addition, supplementation with glutamate, glutamine, and leucine, but not lysine, increased triglyceride synthesis and decreased glucose uptake. Glutamate, glutamine, and leucine increased activation of protein kinase B, suggesting that induction of de novo lipogenesis occurs via the insulin signaling cascade.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how select amino acids induce de novo lipogenesis and insulin resistance, suggesting that high-protein feeding to tackle diabetes and obesity requires greater consideration.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Meh.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s surprising at all that there is excess protein energy showing up as lipid energy, and attempting to more deeply characterize the mechanism is a useful thing to do.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s look at that conclusion:</p>

<p><em>CONCLUSION. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how select amino acids induce de novo lipogenesis and insulin resistance, suggesting that high-protein feeding to tackle diabetes and obesity requires greater consideration.</em> </p>

<p>The study didn&#39;t show *at all* how this created insulin resistance or even that it *could* create insulin resistance. The real question WRT insulin resistance is not DNL, it&#39;s the rate of DNL versus lipid clearance from the liver. If lipids are created/absorbed faster than they are cleared, you will get fat accumulation. Otherwise, you will not. </p>

<p>Since the clinical data tends to show that moderate protein (and especially moderate protein low carb) diets perform better when it comes to insulin resistance, I think there&#39;s a lot of wishful thinking in that conclusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Very interesting pilot study.  I hope they get funding for a trial with a larger and more diverse population.</p>

<p>More detail about the protocols:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nine healthy, nonsmoking men</strong> took part in a randomized, 3-way crossover
study. Twenty-four hours before each trial day, the diet and activity of each participant were monitored.
On the trial day, participants attended the Medical Research Council — Elsie Widdowson Laboratory
(MRC-EWL) for 7 hours and received one of the 3 isoenergetic mixed meals in a randomized order.
Nine subjects were randomized into one block. Randomization was generated using a computerized program that generates random permutations. Volunteers were randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio, such that each
volunteer consumed all 3 meals within a period of 6 weeks. <strong>The isoenergetic meals comprised: control
(C; 15% protein, 40% fat, 45% carbohydrate), high-protein (HP; 32% protein, 33% fat, 35% carbohydrate), and high-fat (HF; 14% protein, 62% fat, 24% carbohydrate).</strong></p>

<p>....</p>

<p>Participants arrived in the morning after a 12-hour overnight fast. Participants were
cannulated via the antecubital vein of one arm and blood samples were collected, 10 minutes apart. <strong>Participants then consumed, within 15 minutes of onset of eating, one of the isoenergetic meals. Subsequently
blood samples were collected over a 6-hour period. During the 6-hour period, food consumption was not
allowed, and only water was permitted ad libitum after 3 hours had elapsed. Blood samples were collected at
12 time points at various intervals throughout the 6-hour period</strong> (T1–T6) to perform mass spectrometry and
determine blood lipid changes after an HP meal.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What is defined as ‘high protein’ and ‘moderate protein’ here?</p>

<div class="md"><p>[removed]</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>So does this indicate a high protein diet is beneficial?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Shouldn&#39;t it not matter if in a caloric deficit?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What about a high protein, low carb diet? I remember watching a video (somebody can help me here) where a doctor said protein is ok as long as there&#39;s shortage of carbs.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>in this study, protein was 32% of calories in the high protein meal (around 40 grams) and 15% of calories in the control group <a href="https://caloriesproper.com/protein-is-the-last-thing-that-will-make-you-gain-weight/">https://caloriesproper.com/protein-is-the-last-thing-that-will-make-you-gain-weight/</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>No, this study concludes the opposite.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>That’s for weight loss, not health/nutrition.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s very low carb, and you&#39;re moderate or overweight. Lean people, or those looking for neurological benefits from ketones may be different.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Bill, if 32% of Kcal equals 40 grams of protein, doesn&#39;t that mean that a single meal (1 out of 3) will be 500Kcal and the diet will be basically 1500Kcal a day which is a starvation/CR diet. So, who in his right mind tries to measure DNL (a frigging characteristic of overflow metabolism and Obesity) in CR environment with healthy normal weight subjects? I mean who else besides the other idiot, Acheson et al, 1984 who also picked the subjects to be elite sportsmen on top of that, and who for unknown for me reasons you trust on that. Ah, and talking about him - well, he showed that there was no such thing as DNL happening which was understandable in his scenario. Now those ones - I won&#39;t call them scientists, used the same scenario plus CR (a major DOMINANT confounder in any comparative metabolic study) ...AAAAND showed that there is rampant DNL going on where SOY protein turns magically in SREBP-1c Fatty Acids respectively sdLDL, VLDL &amp; TRIGs, just because they did some experiments with AML12 though mouse liver and mice in general have nothing to do with HUMAN lipid metabolism a.k.a Fatty Acid Oxidation.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thank you for clarifying!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>&quot;...suggesting that high-protein feeding to tackle diabetes and obesity requires greater consideration.&quot;</p>

<p>If it&#39;s to tackle obesity, then presumably we&#39;re talking weight loss...</p>

<div class="md"><p>The journal paper is from 1999 and Australia introduced mandatory iodine fortification of bread in 2009.  That seems to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28867787">have helped</a> but it&#39;s not quite enough.  The paper concludes the issue as being solved but that&#39;s not the takeaway I got from it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Valid 24-h urine samples were provided by 650 children, mean (SD) age 9.3 (1.8) years (n = 359 boys). The mean UIE of 4–8 and 9–13 year olds was 94 (48) and 111 (57) μg/24-h, respectively, with 29% and 26% having a UIE below the age-specific EAR. The median (IQR) UIC was 124 (83,172) μg/L, with 36% of participants having a UIC &lt; 100 μg/L. This convenience sample of Victorian schoolchildren were found to be iodine replete, based on UIC and estimated iodine intakes derived from 24-h urine collections, confirming the findings of the Australian Health Survey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mandatory bread fortification was also introduced in New Zealand with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26018655">helpful, yet insufficient, results.</a>  Again the authors seem to do some handwaving to say that the results are fine so it&#39;s a bit odd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using the WHO/UNICEF/ICCIDD target for iodine sufficiency (a UIC of &gt;100 µg/L) based on school-aged children with a mean urinary volume of 1.0 L, the iodine status of NZ adults does not reach adequate levels (73 µg/L). A more realistic parameter in a population with a higher urinary volume excretion (2.0 L) is the UIE. A median UIE of 127 µg/day suggests that the iodine status of NZ adults is now likely to be adequate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2008, researchers concerned about the growing threat of iodine deficiency analyzed 88 samples1 of iodized table salt—the main supply of this critical micronutrient for most people.2</p>

<p>Less than half of those tested contained amounts of iodine sufficient for optimal health.</p>

<p>Coupled with the trend of reduced salt consumption, rates of iodine deficiency are now reaching epidemic levels.</p>

<p>In the developed world, iodine deficiency has increased more than fourfold over the past 40 years. Nearly 74% of normal, “healthy” adults may no longer consume enough iodine.3,4</p>

<p>In this article, the latest data on this dangerous trend are presented. You will learn of iodine deficiency’s profound impact on overall health. You will discover iodine’s vital role in thyroid function and its link to obesity, cognitive impairment, heart disease, psychiatric disorders, and various forms of cancer. You will also find out how iodine can help ward off breast cancer and fibrocystic breast disease.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The US recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for iodine is 150-290 micrograms (mcg) for adults, while the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine has set the tolerable upper limit at 1,100 mcg.18,23,24</p>

<p>Your Thyroid Gland and the Role of Iodine
These guidelines may be inadequate to address certain health conditions.</p>

<p>They were first established as sufficient only to prevent goiter. Daily doses for optimal health of 3,000-6,000 mcg have been used without side effects in studies of people with other iodine deficiency-related health conditions such as polycystic breast disease.18</p>

<p>By way of comparison, the average daily Japanese consumption of iodine ranges from 5,280 to 13,800 mcg of iodine, with no harmful effects and a host of benefits.18,25,26 The Japanese experience is shedding new light on the importance of iodine, not only for thyroid health, but on other body functions as well. In particular, compelling evidence is emerging about the role of iodine in maintaining breast health, a major concern for millions of American women.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: IODINE DEFICIENCY</p>

<ul>
<li>Iodized salt is the chief source of iodine in the industrialized world.</li>
<li>Rates of iodine deficiency have reached epidemic levels, increasing fourfold over the past 40 years.</li>
<li>Recent scientific analysis reveals that many commercial table salt brands now contain inadequate amounts of iodine.</li>
<li>Iodine is critical to healthy thyroid function.</li>
<li>Inadequate iodine intake causes weight gain, low energy, depression, cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and a variety of cancers.</li>
<li>Iodine is vital to breast health in older women, with low intake correlated to increased risks for breast cancer and fibrocystic breast disease.</li>
</ul>

<p>...</p>

<p>Studies of iodine therapy for breast cancer prevention are encouraging. Continuous iodine given to cancer-prone rats cut mammary tumor rates nearly 2.5-fold.56 Breast cancer cells avidly absorb iodine, which in turn suppresses tumor growth and causes cancer cell death.57,58</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>Iodine deficiency disorders can produce symptoms of low thyroid function (hypothyroidism) even without abnormalities in measured thyroid hormone levels.</strong>34 Recent evidence suggests, for example, that iodine deficiency is linked to obesity, cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders, fibromyalgia, and a variety of cancers.34</p>

<p><strong>Paradoxically, another major consequence of mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency in older adults is hyperthyroidism (excessive thyroid function),</strong> especially in women.35 This is the result of rapidly growing thyroid gland nodules that over-produce thyroid hormone; it can trigger cardiac arrhythmias, osteoporosis, and muscle wasting.35</p>

<p>Among those negative consequences is the impact of iodine deficiency on breast health. Compelling data are emerging that link iodine deficiency to breast cancers and high rates of fibrocystic breast disease, two of the greatest concerns of older women in the US. It’s worth exploring those data here; including evidence that iodine supplementation can promote healthy breast tissue.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Objective: To assess iodine status in four separate groups -- pregnant women, postpartum women, patients with diabetes mellitus and volunteers.</p>

<p>Design and setting: Prospective cross-sectional study at a tertiary referral hospital in Sydney.
Participants: 81 pregnant women attending a &quot;high risk&quot; obstetric clinic; 26 of these same women who attended three months postpartum; 135 consecutive patients with diabetes mellitus attending the diabetes clinic for an annual complications screen; and 19 volunteers. There were no exclusion criteria.
Methods: Spot urine samples were obtained, and urinary iodine was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer.</p>

<p>Outcome measures: Iodine status based on urinary iodine concentration categorised as normal (&gt; 100 µg/L), mild deficiency (51-100 µg/L) and moderate to severe deficiency (&lt; 50 µg/L).</p>

<p>Results: Moderate to severe iodine deficiency was found in 16 pregnant women (19.8%), five postpartum women (19.2%), 46 patients with diabetes (34.1%) and five volunteers (26.3%). Mild iodine deficiency was found in an additional 24 pregnant women (29.6%), nine postpartum women (34.6%), 51 patients with diabetes (37.8%) and 9 normal volunteers (47.4%). Median urinary iodine concentration was 104 µg/L in pregnant women, 79 µg/L in postpartum women, 65 µg/L in patients with diabetes mellitus and 64 µg/L in volunteers.</p>

<p>Conclusions: The high frequency of iodine deficiency found in our participants suggests that dietary sources of iodine in this country may no longer be sufficient. Further population studies are required.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Although the trace element boron has yet to be recognized as an essential nutrient for humans, recent data from animal and human studies suggest that boron may be important for mineral metabolism and membrane function. To investigate further the functional role of boron, brain electrophysiology and cognitive performance were assessed in response to dietary manipulation of boron (approximately 0.25 versus approximately 3.25 mg boron/2000 kcal/day) in three studies with healthy older men and women. Within-subject designs were used to assess functional responses in all studies. Spectral analysis of electroencephalographic data showed effects of dietary boron in two of the three studies. When the low boron intake was compared to the high intake, there was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in the proportion of low-frequency activity, and a decrease in the proportion of higher-frequency activity, an effect often observed in response to general malnutrition and heavy metal toxicity. Performance (e.g., response time) on various cognitive and psychomotor tasks also showed an effect of dietary boron. When contrasted with the high boron intake, low dietary boron resulted in significantly poorer performance (p &lt; 0.05) on tasks emphasizing manual dexterity (studies II and III); eye-hand coordination (study II); attention (all studies); perception (study III); encoding and short-term memory (all studies); and long-term memory (study I). Collectively, the data from these three studies indicate that boron may play a role in human brain function and cognitive performance, and provide additional evidence that boron is an essential nutrient for humans.</p>

<p>Nothing Boring About Boron.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>The trace mineral boron is a micronutrient with diverse and vitally important roles in metabolism that render it necessary for plant, animal, and human health, and as recent research suggests, possibly for the evolution of life on Earth. As the current article shows, boron has been proven to be an important trace mineral because it (1) is essential for the growth and maintenance of bone; (2) greatly improves wound healing; (3) beneficially impacts the body&#39;s use of estrogen, testosterone, and vitamin D; (4) boosts magnesium absorption; (5) reduces levels of inflammatory biomarkers, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α); (6) raises levels of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase; (7) protects against pesticide-induced oxidative stress and heavy-metal toxicity; (8) improves the brains electrical activity, cognitive performance, and short-term memory for elders; (9) influences the formation and activity of key biomolecules, such as S-adenosyl methionine (SAM-e) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)); (10) has demonstrated preventive and therapeutic effects in a number of cancers, such as prostate, cervical, and lung cancers, and multiple and non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma; and (11) may help ameliorate the adverse effects of traditional chemotherapeutic agents. In none of the numerous studies conducted to date, however, do boron&#39;s beneficial effects appear at intakes &gt; 3 mg/d. No estimated average requirements (EARs) or dietary reference intakes (DRIs) have been set for boron-only an upper intake level (UL) of 20 mg/d for individuals aged ≥ 18 y. The absence of studies showing harm in conjunction with the substantial number of articles showing benefits support the consideration of boron supplementation of 3 mg/d for any individual who is consuming a diet lacking in fruits and vegetables or who is at risk for or has osteopenia; osteoporosis; osteoarthritis (OA); or breast, prostate, or lung cancer.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is a video presentation of a thorough critique of the EAT-Lancet report and the studies referenced by it.</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/EAT">EAT-Lancet report</a> has the feel of a royal decree, operating under the guise of good intentions, seeking to impose its benevolent will on all subjects of planet Earth. It is well worth challenging the presumed authority of this group of 37 “experts,” because it wields tremendous power and influence, has access to billions of dollars, and is likely to affect your health, your choices, and your checkbook in the near future.  </p>

<p>Capitalizing on our current public health and environmental crises, the EAT-Lancet Commission pronounces itself as <em>the</em> authority on the science of nutrition, exploits our worst fears, and seeks to dictate our food choices in accordance with its members&#39; personal, professional and possible commercial interests.  </p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, <strong>there has never been a human clinical trial designed to test the health effects of simply removing animal foods from the diet, without making any other diet or lifestyle changes such as eliminating refined carbohydrates and other processed foods</strong>. Unless and until such research is conducted demonstrating clear benefits to this strategy, <strong>the assertion that human beings would be healthier without animal foods remains an</strong> <strong><em>untested hypothesis</em></strong> with clear risks to human life and health. Prescribing plant-based diets to the planet without including straightforward warnings of these risks and offering clear guidance as to how to minimize them is scientifically irresponsible and medically unethical, and therefore should not form the basis of public health recommendations. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/diagnosis-diet/201901/eat-lancets-plant-based-planet-10-things-you-need-know">ref</a></p>

<p>I think that was my 4th grade teacher</p>

<div class="md"><p>Just for transparency my stance is that normal healthy people can do reasonably well on variety of diets, including (going by long-term anecdotes as there are no formal clinical studies) certain extreme ones like carnivore diet - however during the recent decades vegetarian bias has seeped into the nutritional world blaming animal products for various ailments.</p>

<p>The earliest instance of this, from what I understand, was the switch from using animal fats (eg: suet and tallow) to industrialized vegetables oils:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://nefertemnaturals.com/blogs/news/the-history-and-benefits-of-beef-tallow">the last 70 years</a>, tallow has all but vanished from our vocabulary. It was vilified by vegetable oil producers as an artery clogging, unhealthy fat when in fact, it is one of the best oils to both cook with and rub on your skin.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Has there been studies done on athletes following a ketogenic diet to determine which energy source (plant fats vs animal fats) is most effective for hypertrophy with all things being equal (eg: same protein quantity)?</p>

<p>Bear in mind that in a normal ketogenic diet there is a significant amount of plant fats already (coconut oils, nuts, etc) but in certain forms of keto such as <a href="/r/PaleolithicKetogenic">r/PaleolithicKetogenic</a> (or even <a href="/r/meatogains">r/meatogains</a> but with high fat instead of high protein) animal fat is almost exclusively used.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I would cite some papers but I do not believe that research has been done yet.  Fat seems to play the smallest role in hypertrophy (protein obviously being first, followed by carbs), so variances in fatty acid ratios should provide a small impact.  Perhaps from an inflammation aspect there might be some potential impact of not getting enough o-3 or having a very high intake of o-6?</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;d think fat (in keto) plays as much of a substantial role as carbs (in standard diets) inasmuch as they are both significant source of calories that is needed for hypertrophy. The question though is: whether the calorie source matters.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the current list of studies, but don&#39;t think they take what I&#39;m asking into account: <a href="https://sci-fit.net/ketogenic-diet-fat-muscle-performance/#How_keto_affects_body_fat_and_muscle_mass">https://sci-fit.net/ketogenic-diet-fat-muscle-performance/#How_keto_affects_body_fat_and_muscle_mass</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>whether the calorie source matters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well it absolutely does.  The protein example is the most obvious of course.  You can get 3000 calories but if your protein intake is 50g then you are going to have a very hard time gaining muscle.  After that, if your carb intake is too low then power output will decline since two of the three pathways of ATP production (glycolysis and the citric acid cycle) depend on oxidation of glucose.  This is why even keto proponents like <a href="https://hvmn.com/podcast">Geoffrey Woo</a> recommend carbs before exercise sessions.  Top-level power athletes on fully ketogenic diets are one in a million although <a href="https://sigmanutrition.com/episode286/">carb periodization</a> has become more popular recently.</p>

<p>Thinking back to your original question, you could speculate that coconut might have a beneficial impact since it&#39;s the food highest in MCTs and MCTs could provide an easy substrate for energy in a carb-restricted athlete.  The only trial I am aware of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09637481003702114?journalCode=iijf20">didn&#39;t show exercise benefit</a> but that was in carb-replete athletes, not keto athletes.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Does he? From the very same site you linked to I found <a href="https://hvmn.com/blog/keto-diet/building-muscle-on-keto-an-evidence-based-guide#carbohydrate">this</a> which says otherwise:</p>

<p><em>Protein consumption post-resistance training promotes muscle growth; carbs, on the other hand, aren’t necessary for muscle growth.</em></p>

<p><em>Current belief suggests ingesting carbs along with protein following a workout will enhance the anabolic effect of exercise by raising insulin levels. But evidence doesn’t support this claim. Several studies have shown the combined impact of carbohydrate and protein ingestion after resistance exercise doesn’t further increase muscle protein synthesis (vs. protein intake alone).</em><a href="https://hvmn.com/blog/keto-diet/building-muscle-on-keto-an-evidence-based-guide#Staples2011"><strong><em>18</em></strong></a><em>,</em><a href="https://hvmn.com/blog/keto-diet/building-muscle-on-keto-an-evidence-based-guide#Koopman2007"><strong><em>19</em></strong></a><em>,</em><a href="https://hvmn.com/blog/keto-diet/building-muscle-on-keto-an-evidence-based-guide#Miller2003"><strong><em>20</em></strong></a><em>,</em><a href="https://hvmn.com/blog/keto-diet/building-muscle-on-keto-an-evidence-based-guide#Glynn2013"><strong><em>21</em></strong></a></p>

<p><em>The relatively low concentrations of insulin, stimulated by dietary protein, are sufficient to achieve maximal increase in muscle protein synthesis and/or reduce protein breakdown. The additional rise in insulin levels triggered by carbs does not appear to provide a greater stimulus for protein synthesis.</em><a href="https://hvmn.com/blog/keto-diet/building-muscle-on-keto-an-evidence-based-guide#Staples2011"><strong><em>18</em></strong></a><em>,</em><a href="https://hvmn.com/blog/keto-diet/building-muscle-on-keto-an-evidence-based-guide#Koopman2007"><strong><em>19</em></strong></a></p>

<p><em>Another common belief is that carbs are essential to consume after every workout to replenish muscle glycogen levels (stored carb energy). But after an extended period of adaptation to ketosis, muscle glycogen is the same as athletes who eat a normal, higher-carb diet.</em></p>

<p><em>In a ground-breaking study, elite ultra-marathoners and Ironman triathletes who were keto-adapted for an average of 20 months had similar rates of glycogen repletion post-exercise compared to athletes on a high-carb diet.</em></p>

<p><em>After exercise, the low-carb athletes consumed 4 grams of carbs and 31 grams of fat; the high-carb group ingested 43 grams of carbs and 14 grams of fat.</em><a href="https://hvmn.com/blog/keto-diet/building-muscle-on-keto-an-evidence-based-guide#Volek2016"><strong><em>22</em></strong></a> <em>But both showed similar rates of glycogen repletion–how?</em></p>

<p><em>So where’s all the glycogen coming from, if not from carbs? Gluconeogenesis likely caused the synthesis of glycogen in low-carb athletes; non-carbohydrate molecules, such as lactate amino acids and glycerol (from fat burning) are used to make glucose in the liver. This glucose is transported to muscle tissue, where it’s stored as glycogen.</em><a href="https://hvmn.com/blog/keto-diet/building-muscle-on-keto-an-evidence-based-guide#Volek2016"><strong><em>22</em></strong></a><em>,</em><a href="https://hvmn.com/blog/keto-diet/building-muscle-on-keto-an-evidence-based-guide#Evans2017"><strong><em>23</em></strong></a></p>

<p><em>In essence–carbs aren’t required to trigger protein synthesis or make muscle glycogen.</em></p>

<p><em>Does this same logic follow resistance training? Yes. While lifting weights is one of the most important triggers for muscle growth, glycogen is less important for resistance work (when compared to endurance training). Muscle glycogen is reduced by more than 60% after two hours of running;</em><a href="https://hvmn.com/blog/keto-diet/building-muscle-on-keto-an-evidence-based-guide#Volek2016"><strong><em>22</em></strong></a> <em>but during high-intensity resistance workouts (6 - 9 sets per muscle group), muscle glycogen is depleted by 36% - 39%.</em><a href="https://hvmn.com/blog/keto-diet/building-muscle-on-keto-an-evidence-based-guide#Aragon2013"><strong><em>24</em></strong></a></p>

<p><em>A post-workout drink with whey protein, along with exercise-induced lactate, may be sufficient to restock muscle glycogen via gluconeogenesis–without the need for carbs.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Does he?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, he does. For example, in <a href="https://hvmn.com/podcast/exercising-metabolism-ft-dr-brad-schoenfeld-ep-111">this recent podcast</a> he admitted to muscle growth limitations on a purely ketogenic diet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Schoenfeld:</p>

<p><strong>AMPK is a catabolic pathway, it&#39;s an energy sensing pathway. When glycogen levels are low AMPK is going to tell them to get raised. Now, there&#39;s a lot of issues in terms of research on AMPK anyway, but just at least conceptually it&#39;s going to put you in more of a catabolic state because the purpose of AMPK is to initiate catabolism to bring your energy state back, meaning to raise your glycogen. So, basically it&#39;s going to, will often tend to impair the initiation of mtor, which is an anabolic enzyme, and thus just that in itself would tend to lead you to think that it&#39;s not going to be the greatest for muscle building. And, look the 80% of a bodybuilding style routine is fueled by glycogen, intermuscular glycogen.</strong></p>

<p>So, <strong>when you&#39;re going to substantially deplete glycogen as you do in a ketogenic diet you&#39;re not going to have the energy, if you will, to fuel the workouts as well. Not that you can&#39;t get through a bodybuilding workout, but just that your performance would tend to suffer. There&#39;s been a recent study that it shows somewhat less muscle growth when they had a ketogenic diet, fat loss was similar but ketogenic diet did not promote as good growth of muscle.</strong> These diet studies are very difficult to carry out, I&#39;m always somewhat skeptical because you tell people to do certain things. We can control a training study when people are there, and how they&#39;re training. When we have a diet study...unless you&#39;re in a metabolic ward and you&#39;re telling people what to do, adherence from my personal experience and from what I&#39;ve seen in literature as well, it just is not great.</p>

<p>Geoff:</p>

<p>I completely agree, I think you look at a lot of the epidemiological studies its just like people are reporting like 1800 calories a day, which is clearly they&#39;re not eating 1800 calories a day.</p>

<p>Schoenfeld:</p>

<p>And not even epidemiologic, I&#39;m talking about randomized controlled trials where you put someone on a diet. I&#39;ve done this, running these studies and you tell them what to eat. With ketogenic diets it&#39;s a little easier to tell whether they&#39;re doing it because you can measure the ketone levels at least. To get some insights it&#39;s kind of hard to know what the other, you also not knowing what the calories are so... Anyway, these are just confounding issues that make drawing tactical implications, practical entrances difficult.</p>

<p>Geoff:</p>

<p>Yeah, no <strong>I think you bring up a good point because usually we bring a lot of folk study insulin resistance, low carb diets, and an application of diet nutrition for longevity or pre diabetes or neurological conditions. I think you&#39;re adding a refreshing angle here that there&#39;s not a free lunch, if you are inhibiting MTOR, which is an anabolic pathway... Which that might have good applications for longevity, or metabolic syndrome applications, but if you&#39;re looking for athletic performance or bodybuilding or hypertrophy applications then that&#39;s the trade off that you&#39;re making. So, if you&#39;re trying to be the most jacked person ever that&#39;s a completely different goal than I want to live as long as possible.</strong> Potentially minimizing my functional strength in my health span.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I suppose this is most interesting to seriously consider for bodybuilders more so than laymen like myself and <a href="https://peterattiamd.com/what-do-anabolic-steroids-epo-and-carbohydrates-have-in-common/">Peter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>So why am I in ketosis, even though I might “perform” better at some things if I ate carbohydrates?</strong> Because I’m a 39-year-old wannabe athlete whose athletic performance is irrelevant.  Not a single person cares how fast I swim or ride my bike beyond myself.  I have no sponsors. I will never earn a paycheck for how fast I can flip tires or climb <a href="http://www.mapmyride.com/us/valley-center-ca/mt-palomar-long-loop-route-946045">Mount Palomar</a>.  I am more than willing to give up some athletic performance (e.g., sprint speed, peak power) in exchange for other athletic benefits (e.g., greater aerobic capacity and metabolic flexibility), especially when the <strong>real gain</strong> is greater health and a <strong>reduction in my risk for all diseases associated with metabolic syndrome</strong> (heart disease, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and others).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Perhaps, but targeted carb consumption / carb cycling would give you the best of both worlds so I don&#39;t see a reason not to implement it if you are concerned about muscle gain or athletic performance.  Or you could even be a high-carb diet and incorporate intermittent fasting.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This Subbotin paper is great, and I would love to see responses to it from the Lipidology crowd. There&#39;s another great paper from Gurr, and a whole book from C. Velican that cover the pathology side.... paging <a href="/u/nickandre15">/u/nickandre15</a></p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>The consensus hypothesis on coronary atherosclerosis suggests high LDL-C levels as the major cause and pursues it as the therapeutic target, explicitly assuming: (i) tunica intima of human coronaries consists of only one cell layer - endothelium, situated on a thin layer of scarcely cellular matrix; and (ii) subendothelial lipoprotein retention initiates the disease. Facts showed: (i) normal tunica intima invariably consists of multiple cellular layers; and (ii) initial lipid depositions occurred in the deepest layers of tunica intima. This review suggests that coronary atherosclerosis starts with pathological intimal expansion, resulting in intimal hypoxia and neovascularization from adventitial vasa vasorum, facilitating lipoprotein extraction by previously avascular deep intimal tissues. Until the hypothesis incorporates real knowledge, our efforts will probably be off-target.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Honestly, the relevance of this hypothesis for users of this sub is very limited because it doesn&#39;t discuss nutrition at all. If the hypothesis were true ApoB-Particles would still very much implicated in the pathogenesis. So keep your ApoB particle count low.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I’m pretty sure if you blow the lipid up with an electron microscope you see C Pneumoniae bacteria. This seems like an opportunistic infection that happens when the tissue degrades following abnormal proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>From a high level, we still have a poor picture of what is triggering the initial stages:</p>

<ol>
<li>We have some sort of damage, probably immune driven maybe endotoxin response type deal. This plus hemodynamics is the only way we can explain the localization of the disease within the arterial branch structure. </li>
<li>We have vascular smooth muscle cell dedifferentiation (from contractile to synthetic phenotype) and proliferation from the media into the intima, crossing the membrane. This is probably in response to damage. Some literature suggests insulin may be involved but I’m not so sure that’s the root cause — endotoxins seem more interesting. </li>
<li>There is a critical threshold of thickness (150 um or so according to Velican) after which oxygen cannot diffuse through the tissue. It’s not clear, for example, why we might see neovascularization versus fermentation and cell death leading to intimal necrotic areas. I emailed Subbotin but he hasn’t gotten back to me so I should ping him again. </li>
</ol>

<p>I’m also not sure how we reconcile the Malcolm Kendrick hypothesis with this endotoxins hypothesis. </p>

<p>I’m also not sure how the observation of bacteria fits in here. My assumption is that the C Pneumoniae bacteria are an opportunistic infection that explains the accumulation of extracellular lipid later in the progression.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are marketed as sugar alternatives providing sweet taste with few or no calories. Yet their consumption has been linked to metabolic dysfunction and changes in the gut microbiome. NNS exposure mostly originates from diet beverages and sweetener packages in adults or breastmilk in infants. Consequences of early life exposure remain largely unknown. <strong>We exposed pregnant and lactating mice to NNS (sucralose, acesulfame-K) at doses relevant for human consumption</strong>. <strong>While the pups’ exposure was low, metabolic changes were drastic</strong>, indicating extensive downregulation of hepatic detoxification mechanisms and changes in bacterial metabolites. Microbiome profiling confirmed a significant increase in firmicutes and a striking <strong>decrease of Akkermansia muciniphila</strong>. Similar microbiome alterations in humans have been linked to metabolic disease and obesity. While our findings need to be reproduced in humans, they suggest that NNS consumption during pregnancy and lactation may have adverse effects on infant metabolism.</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>Which systematic review?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>In the comment above.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I read that link and comment breakdown from other thread and can’t make head nor tales of it to be honest. So I still don’t have that answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I do not believe that review included an analysis of monk fruit but I can try to break down the stevia section a bit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>....the microbiota (no differences found between humans and rats) are able to degrade the main components, stevioside and rebaudioside A, to steviol (55, 56). Therefore, neither stevioside nor rebaudioside A is absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract (30).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stevia is primarily made of two components, stevioside and rebaudioside.  Humans and mice can both break these components down into steviol in the stomach so these components are not absorbed in the upper GI (since they are broken down before they reach the upper GI).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bacteroides are the most efficient group of bacteria at hydrolyzing stevioside and rebaudioside A to steviol (56). Other bacterial groups, such as lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, Clostridium, coliforms, and enterococci species, were tested. None of the tested bacteria were able to hydrolyze and use steviol glycosides as a usable substrate (56). These tested bacterial groups are the major types of bacteria found in the gastrointestinal tracts of animals and humans (57).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bacteroides (a common type of gut bacteria) are good at breaking down the two components into steviol, while other common bacterial groups cannot.  However, none of the tested bacteria (including bacteroides) were able to break down steviol.  This indicates that steviol is likely to pass through the digestive system undigested by humans or their microbes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition, compared with glucose, 24 h incubation of mixed fecal bacteria from volunteers with stevioside and rebaudioside A caused a slight alteration of the human microbiota (56). Stevioside weakly inhibits anaerobic bacteria, whereas rebaudioside A weakly inhibits aerobic bacteria, in particular over coliforms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One study took feces from volunteers and fermented it for 24 hours with the two components.  The study found that the first component slightly inhibited anaerobic (oxygen-lacking) bacteria while the second component slightly inhibited aerobic (oxygen-utilizing) bacteria.  This could indicate a &#39;balance&#39; of inhibition between aerobic and anaerobic bacteria both being inhibited but 24 hours is longer than you would have these compounds in your digestive tract and these compounds are theoretically already broken down by the time they get into your intestines so the results might not be very relevant.</p>

<p>So, the TL;DR is that stevia is primarily made up of two compounds that appear to be broken down into steviol before they enter the digestive phase where the microbiota have access to them.  Steviol is indigestible while the two compounds (if they reach that part of the gut) might impact the gut microbiome, but with each favoring opposite bacterial types.  So, if there is a bacterial modification risk from stevia, it currently appears to be a low risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The evidence in humans is limited, but there is animal-model data showing that some are harmful but others have little-no impact, or they change the gut microbiome but not necessarily in a bad way.</p>

<p><a href="/u/dreiter">/u/dreiter</a> would you agree that&#39;s an accurate summary? Perhaps you can add a summary like that to break it down for people.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to break this down for me!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Also. Wanted to tell you how much I appreciate your seemingly constant work on providing this information to us and answering questions. I feel like you deserve patron support or something to be honest.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks for the heads up.  I think that&#39;s definitely accurate.  There are enough sweeteners now that we really shouldn&#39;t be lumping them all together in news headlines since they all act differently in the body.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My issue was I couldn’t tell which did which. The only part I could somewhat understand was the stevia portion made it sound like it actually had benefits?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Sure!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks :)</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The incidence of breast cancer with distant involvement at diagnosis is increasing in young women, age 25-39, possibly at an accelerating rate, as previously demonstrated by Johnson et al.1 This disturbing trend was also observed in women age 40-54, albeit to a letter extent. Understanding the causes for these changes in cancer demographics is particularly important in view of the young age of these women, as well as the poor survival rate for women with distant metastatic breast disease. There have been explanations proposed in several letters, including vaccination 2, advanced-age at first pregnancy 3 as well as folate supplementation 4, however these explanations have not been particularly satisfying. In response, the original authors 5 suggested causal association need explain: 1) why a proposed agent or risk factor would cause advanced disease, 2) why it would preferentially affect the youngest women, and 3) how temporal trends in the proposed causative agent have changed since the mid-1970s 5. The hypothesis that iodine deficiency in the United States, plays a role in the increased incidence of breast cancer with distant involvement, is discussed here in the context of these three factors.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>2) Population Iodine Deficiency: Increased iodine demand in women is likely due to the increased uptake of iodine in breast tissue, in addition to the thyroid gland, where iodine plays a role in the development and maintenance of healthy breast tissue (expanding after puberty) and in breast remodeling during lactation, and pregnancy 12. Young women and to a greater extent pregnant women, have lower urinary iodine levels than men of similar age.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Iodine deficiency is associated with fibrocystic breast disease, which can be effectively treated or prevented with iodine supplementation 24. Fibrocystic breast disease affects at least 50% of women of child-bearing age and is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer 25.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Studies in rats have previously demonstrated that iodine deficiency results in “hyperresponsiveness” to estradiol, resulting in increased alveolar cell proliferation, abnormal changes within nuclei, and increased uptake of iodine within vacuoles, in estradiol stimulated mammary glands 27.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>According to the nutritional survey reports during the period 2005-2008, pregnant women had median urinary iodine levels of 125 μg/liter, and 56.9 percent had levels less than the 150-249 μg/liter urinary iodine recommended by the World Health Organization32. Thus, although potentially stabilized, the inadequate iodine levels observed in young women persists, with black women and pregnant women especially at risk. In addition to the potential risk for breast cancer, even mild iodine insufficiency appears to correlate with neurocognitive impairments in children33. Thus, iodine insufficiency represents a major health issue for women of childbearing age as well as developing fetuses.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In conclusion, dietary iodine insufficiency represents a plausible explanation for the increasing incidence of breast cancer in young women with distant metastasis. In view of the established reduction in iodine levels in US women of childbearing age since the mid 70s, this group would be most vulnerable to increased breast cancer risk. The increased sensitivity of breast tissue to estradiol induced proliferative changes in the setting of dietary iodine insufficiency, provides a plausible mechanistic explanation for the increasing incidence of breast cancer with distant involvement in this age group. Based on the importance of iodine in thyroid and breast health, fetal brain development, as well as deficits in nutritional trends among younger women, iodine testing and management may be considered as a potentially important aspect for clinical practice.</p>

<p><strong>Uptake and gene expression with antitumoral doses of iodine in thyroid and mammary gland: evidence that chronic administration has no harmful effects.</strong></p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Several studies have demonstrated that moderately high concentrations of molecular iodine (I(2)) diminish the symptoms of mammary fibrosis in women, reduce the occurrence of mammary cancer induced chemically in rats (50-70%), and have a clear antiproliferative and apoptotic effect in the human tumoral mammary cell line MCF-7. Nevertheless, the importance of these effects has been underestimated, in part because of the notion that exposure to excess iodine represents a potential risk to thyroid physiology. In the present work we demonstrate that uptake and metabolism of iodine differ in an organ-specific manner and also depend on the chemical form of the iodine ingested (potassium iodide vs. I(2)). Further, we show that a moderately high I(2) supplement (0.05%) causes some of the characteristics of the &quot;acute Wolff-Chaikoff effect&quot;; namely, it lowers expression of the sodium/iodide symporter, pendrin, thyroperoxidase (TPO), and deiodinase type 1 in thyroid gland without diminishing circulating levels of thyroid hormone. <strong>Finally, we confirm that I(2) metabolism is independent of TPO, and we demonstrate that, at the doses used here, which are potentially useful to treat mammary tumors, chronic I(2) supplement is not accompanied by any harmful secondary effects on the thyroid or general physiology. Thus, we suggest that I(2) could be considered for use in clinical trials of breast cancer therapies.</strong></p>

<p>Introduction</p>

<p>Most investigations of iodine metabolism in humans and animals have focused on its role in thyroid
function. Public health policies have been established to supply deficient populations with the necessary amount of this
element and eradicate the iodine deficiency diseases, primarily cretinism (1). However, considerable evidence indicates
that iodine per se could also be implicated in the physiology
of other organs, such as the mammary gland (2,3). In humans
the total amount of iodine in the body is 30–50 mg, and less
than 30% of it is present in the thyroid gland and its hormones. About 60% of total iodine is nonhormonal and is concentrated in extrathyroidal tissues, where its biological role is
still unknown (4). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that
iodine distribution in the organism depends on the chemical
form of iodine ingested, and that molecular iodine (I2) is not
totally reduced to iodide (I) in the blood before it is absorbed
systemically from the gastrointestinal tract (5). Indeed, in
iodine deficiency conditions, I appears to be more efficient
than I2 in restoring the thyroid gland to normal from a goitrous state, whereas I2 is distinctly more effective in diminishing mammary dysplasia and atypia resulting from iodine
deficiency (6). In euthyroid conditions, I2 supplementation
diminishes the symptoms ofmammary fibrosisinwomen (7,8),
causes a 50–70% reduction in the occurrence of mammary
cancer induced chemically in rats (9,10), and has a clear antiproliferative and apoptotic effect in the human tumoral mammary cell line MCF-7 (11,12). 
Nevertheless, these findings
have been viewed with caution because exposure to moderate or high iodine is thought to be a potential risk to thyroid
physiology (leading to hypothyroidism or autoimmune disease) as well as to general health (retinal damage). Careful
examination shows that pathological responses occurred at
low or moderate iodine intake in patients with underlying or
evident thyroid pathology (e.g., Hashimoto’s thyroiditis,
history of treated Graves’ diseases, etc.) or in normal subjects
only with excessively high doses of iodine or I (&gt;20 mg=
day; reviewed in Refs. 13–15). In contrast, no damaging effects were reported in either the human or animal studies (6–
10) that used therapeutic I2 concentrations (3–15 mg=day).
The lack of damage by moderate iodine excess might be
explained by mechanisms called ‘‘thyroid autoregulation’’
that were first described in 1940 by Morton, who observed
that moderate amounts of I inhibited the formation of thyroid hormones (THs) by incubated sheep thyroid slices (16).</p>

<p>In fact, the thyroid gland has regulatory mechanisms that
maintain normal synthesis and secretion of TH over a wide
range of iodine availability. Currently, the recommended daily
iodine intake is 150 mg=day, and the safe upper limit (UL)
is 1.1 mg=day which comes from the Braverman group’s
studies in humans, in which more than 1.5 mg of I daily
induced small but significant decreases in serum thyroxine
(T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations and a significant increase in the thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone,
TSH) concentration (17). When moderately high amounts (3–
10 times the UL) of I are given to euthyroid subjects, a transient decrease in the synthesis of TH occurs for 24–48 hours.
This inhibition of TH synthesis is called ‘‘the acute WolffChaikoff effect,’’ and it is due to increased intrathyroid iodine
concentrations, which inhibit the iodination of tyrosyl residues of thyroglobulin (Tg) by thyroperoxidase (TPO). After
48 hours of I excess, the thyroid gland escapes from this effect by an adaptation that decreases the thyroid iodine trap,
thereby decreasing the intrathyroid iodine concentration (18).
Excess I inhibits the expression of the mRNA and protein of
the sodium=iodide symporter (NIS) and other thyroid functions, as well as TPO mRNA expression, Tg proteolysis, hormone secretion, thyroid blood flow, glucose and amino acid
transport, and thyroid growth (19–21). Two different mechanisms have been proposed to explain these effects. The first is
that iodine inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, reducing accumulation of cAMP (22), and the second is that excess iodine
inhibits hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation, which is crucial
for TH synthesis catalyzed by TPO (23). The Wolff-Chaikoff
effect is prevented by inhibitors of I organification, such as
methimazole (MMI) and propylthiouracil (PTU); therefore, the
existence of a putative organic iodine compound that mediates
this effect has been proposed (21).</p>

<p>Another possibility to explain the lack of deleterious effects on thyroid physiology when therapeutic I2 treatments
have been applied against mammary tumors is that the mechanisms for uptake and metabolism of I2 might be different
from those well established for I.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The last part of the present experiments shows that a
chronic I2 supplement creates an organ-specific response.
The levels of NIS and PEN expression decrease in thyroid,
but they remain unchanged in normal mammary glands. An
interesting observation is that in tumoral mammary gland, I2
increases the expression of NIS, PEN, and LPO, suggesting
that its antitumoral effect involves mechanisms related to the
uptake and oxidation of I. Although I2 metabolism in tumoral mammary gland has not been reported, our studies in
mammary MCF-7 cells show that I2 supplement is accompanied by the generation of iodinated lipids with a migration
similar to that of 6-iodolactone (6-IL), and that formation of
this iodolipid is not blocked with PTU (11). In the thyroid
gland, the antiproliferative and=or apoptotic effect of I
treatment is mediated by iodinated arachidonic acid (AA)
derivatives, such as 6-IL or iodohexadecanal (36–38). Iodolipid formation in mammary gland treated with I2 has not
been investigated in vivo. Several studies have reported elevated prostaglandin levels in breast cancer but not in normal
mammary gland (39,40). Prostaglandins are produced from
AA by the enzyme cyclooxygenase, indicating the presence
of high levels of AA in breast tumors. It is possible that these
high levels of AA and the iodolipids formed from them may
explain the specific effect of I2 only in tumoral tissues.</p>

<p>Finally, in chronically I2-treated animals, there is a persistent decrease in thyroid NIS and PEN expression, but serum
concentrations of TH and TSH are the same as those found
in control animals. Goiter, hypothyroidism, elevated serum
TSH values, and even ocular damage have been reported to
result from ingestion of excess iodine in medications such
as amiodarone, in by-products of iodine-containing water
purification systems, in iodine-containing mouth rinses, or in
the diet. However, in these reports, pathological responses
occurred in normal subjects only when the I dose was extremely high (reviewed in Refs. 13–15). <strong>In contrast, several
clinical trials demonstrated that moderately high levels of I2
(3–6 mg=day) could remediate symptoms associated with
chronic clinical mastalgia without thyroid or clinical effect
(7,8). These differences in the thyroid response could be explained by the chemical form of iodine administrated and are
in agreement with the present data showing that thyroid
gland takes up less I2 than I and that the Wolff-Chaikoff
effect is not accompanied by changes in thyroid physiology.</strong>
Thus, our data in mammary cancer models highlight the
importance of I2 in the health of the mammary gland and
provide evidence that the uptake and metabolism of iodine is
organ specific and depends on the chemical form in which it
is ingested. In conclusion, although iodine supplementation
needs to be accompanied by careful supervision, especially
in subjects with underlying or evident thyroid pathologies,
we propose that I2 supplementation could be considered for
use in clinical trials of breast cancer therapies.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>Lithium is a medication used to treat bipolar disorder and may also prevent cognitive decline and suicide. Lithium is also found naturally, in levels well below clinical doses, in drinking water worldwide, and levels have been inversely associated with rates of psychiatric disorders. Lead (Pb) is another element in the environment but is a toxin of public health concern. Negative effects of chronic lead exposure and possible benefits of environmental lithium exposure appear complementary.</p>

<p>HYPOTHESIS:</p>

<p>Exposure to environmental lithium has associated benefits, which may be due to the mitigation of lead toxicity by lithium.</p>

<p>METHODS:</p>

<p>A series of reviews tested each element of the hypothesis. A systematic review clarified the psychiatric and medical correlates of lithium in drinking water. Non-systematic reviews clarified the harms of environmental lead, summarized experimental studies of lithium used to prevent lead toxicity, and explored overlapping biological mechanisms in lithium and lead exposure.</p>

<p>RESULTS:</p>

<p>Higher levels of lithium in drinking water were associated with lower suicide rates in 13 of 15 identified studies. While fewer studies were available for other outcomes, lithium was associated with lower rates of homicide, crime, dementia, and mortality. Lead was reported to be ubiquitous in the environment, and chronic low-level exposure has been associated with adverse effects, including effects opposite to the outcomes associated with lithium. Animal studies demonstrated that lithium pre-treatment mitigates lead toxicity. Neurophysiological correlates of lead and lithium exposure overlap.</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS:</p>

<p>Microdose lithium is associated with better psychiatric and medical outcomes, which are complementary to harms of environmental lead exposure. Experimental animal evidence is supportive, and lead and lithium impact overlapping neurophysiologic pathways. Therefore, several lines of circumstantial evidence suggest that lithium protects against the neurotoxic effects of lead. Further studies are required to clarify the benefits and mechanisms of low-dose lithium. There are significant public health implications if this paper&#39;s hypothesis is true.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s difficult to tease out what may be discovered here.  The main sources of lithium uptake appear to be eating vegetables and drinking water.  Previous studies have found that increased vegetable consumption and increased water drinking are healthy practice, so it&#39;s unclear if this is really because of lithium or if those are just healthy things to do.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Purpose</p>

<p>Lithium is a nutritionally essential trace element predominantly contained in vegetables, plant-derived foods, and drinking water. Environmental lithium exposure and concurrent nutritional intake vary considerably in different regions. We here have analyzed the possibility that low-dose lithium exposure may affect mortality in both metazoans and mammals.</p>

<p>Methods</p>

<p>Based on a large Japanese observational cohort, we have used weighted regression analysis to identify putative effects of tap water-derived lithium uptake on overall mortality. Independently, we have exposed Caenorhabditis elegans, a small roundworm commonly used for anti-aging studies, to comparable concentrations of lithium, and have quantified mortality during this intervention.</p>

<p>Results</p>

<p>In humans, we find here an inverse correlation between drinking water lithium concentrations and all-cause mortality in 18 neighboring Japanese municipalities with a total of 1,206,174 individuals (β = −0.661, p = 0.003). Consistently, we find that exposure to a comparably low concentration of lithium chloride extends life span of C. elegans (p = 0.047).</p>

<p>Conclusions</p>

<p>Taken together, these findings indicate that long-term low-dose exposure to lithium may exert anti-aging capabilities and unambiguously decreases mortality in evolutionary distinct species.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Lithium, a naturally occurring element, is widely used in clinical settings for psychiatric treatment. Several studies showed that micro-dose lithium (e.g., lithium in drinking water) could have anti-aging and anti-dementia effects in addition to an anti-suicidal effect, although anti-mania and psychosis or anti-cancer effects are yet to be determined.

<p>Keywords: Lithium, Trace element, Suicide, Micro-dose, Aging, Dementia</p>

<p>Core tip: Micro-dose lithium (e.g., lithium in drinking water) could have anti-aging and anti-dementia effects as well as anti-suicidal effect.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>Lithium, a natural element, is widely used in clinical settings for psychiatric treatment. On the other hand, lithium is taken up by all plants, although it appears not to be required for their growth and development. At high levels in the soil, lithium is toxic to all plants, causing a chlorosis-like condition. Uptake and sensitivity to lithium are species dependent. Consequently, grains and vegetables have 0.5-3.4 mg/kg of lithium, dairy products have 0.5 mg/kg of lithium and meat has 0.012 mg/kg[1]. Although there has been a study showing effects of nutritional lithium supplementation on mood[2], no study could directly investigate the association between lithium in the food and mental health. As already pointed out by Schrauzer[1], I wonder whether lithium is one of the trace elements or not. Generally, trace elements are dietary minerals that are needed in very minute quantities for the proper growth, development, and physiology of an organism[3]. If lithium is a trace element, various effects may be found at a very low level of lithium concentration?</p>

<p>TRACE LITHIUM EFFECT ON SUICIDE</p>

<p>With regard to very low lithium levels, there is growing evidence from epidemiological studies that lithium in drinking water may protect against suicide. An inverse association between lithium levels in drinking water and suicide rates was first reported in the United States for 27 Texas counties[4]. In Japan, we showed an inverse association between lithium levels in drinking water and suicide rates for 18 municipalities of Oita prefecture[5] whereas another study found no association for 47 subdivisions in the East of England[6]. A nationwide Austrian study, however, found an inverse association between lithium levels in drinking water and suicide rates after adjustment for population density, per capita income, proportion of Roman Catholics, as well as the availability of mental health service providers[7].</p>

<p>From 2010 to 2013, we investigated the association in 274 municipalities of Kyushu Island in Japan[8]. The association of lithium levels in drinking water with suicide Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) (total, male and female) were investigated thoroughly adjusting for proportion of elderly people, proportion of one person households, proportion of people with college education or more, and proportion of engaging in primary industry, overall unemployment rate, annual marriage rate, annual mean temperature and annual postal savings per person. As a result, lithium levels in drinking water were significantly and inversely associated with male suicide SMRs but not total or female SMRs after the adjustment. The findings suggest that lithium in drinking water may be associated with low risk of male but not female suicide in the general population[8]. With regard to gender differences, anti-aggressive effects of lithium could potentially prevent suicide in those who take lithium-contained drinking water for a long time and, if male aggression is greater and more responsive to lithium than female aggression, this could explain the gender effect[8]. In any case, such findings support the idea that lithium is a trace element.</p>

<p>With regard to the mechanism, taking the fact into consideration that lithium has been reported to increase the volume of the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus[9] it seems likely that lithium may at least partially exert its antisuicidal effect via reinforcing “top-down brakes” of aggressive action. Since lithium has been shown to increase the volume and function of the limbic system, such as the hippocampus[10], antisuicidal effects of lithium may consist of both reinforcing “top-down brakes” and decreasing “bottom-up drive.” Therefore, lithium may have superior antisuicidal effects relative to other mood stabilizers[11,12].</p>

<p>TRACE LITHIUM EFFECT ON MANIA AND PSYCHOSIS</p>

<p>To our knowledge, there has been no reports on effects of lithium as a trace element on mania. This is probably because in a routine psychiatric setting we prescribe about 600-1000 mg per day of lithium to our patients for producing approximately 0.4-1.0 mEq/L of therapeutic lithium levels for mania, which is much larger than the lithium levels of drinking water.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, there has been a study showing that the incidence of patient’s first admissions and prevalence of readmission as well as the diagnosis of psychosis, neurosis, and personality disorder to state mental hospitals from each Texas counties was inversely proportional to the lithium content of their residential drinking water[13]. At the moment, trace lithium effect on mania and psychosis is yet to be determined.</p>

<p>TRACE LITHIUM EFFECT ON AGING</p>

<p>Interestingly, an inverse correlation was found between lithium levels in drinking water and not only suicide but also all-cause mortality in 18 neighboring Japanese municipalities with a total of 1206174 individuals[14]. Taken together with another finding that an exposure to a comparably low concentrations of lithium chloride extended the life span of Caenorhabditis Elegans, these findings suggest that long-term low-dose exposure to lithium may exert anti-aging capabilities[14].</p>

<p>TRACE LITHIUM EFFECT ON DEMENTIA</p>

<p>Micro-dose lithium may also have efficacy in preventing cognitive loss. For example, 113 patients with Alzheimer’s disease were randomized to receive lithium (300 μg/d) (n = 58) or placebo (n = 55) in a 15-mo, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial[15]. The lithium group showed no decline in performance on the mini-mental state examination test in contrast to the lower scores observed for placebo group, with significant differences starting 3 mo after the beginning of the treatment, and increasing progressively[15].</p>

<p>TRACE LITHIUM EFFECT ON CANCER</p>

<p>Although experimental anti-cancer effects of lithium have been shown[16], the range of lithium levels used in the study was 10 mmol/L to 60 mmol/L, which is clearly in the toxic level. Therefore, toxic effects of lithium might have brought about apoptosis in colon cancer cell line. Actually, enhanced but not reduced cancer risk was shown in bipolar disorder patients who were probably receiving long-term lithium treatment[17]. At the moment, anti-cancer effects of lithium is yet to be determined.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>These findings suggest that micro-dose lithium (e.g., lithium in drinking water) could have anti-aging and anti-dementia effects in addition to an anti-suicidal effect, although anti-mania and psychosis or anti-cancer effects are yet to be determined. Although these studies do not provide conclusive evidence, further studies are warranted to investigate whether lithium is trace element. If so, future studies would need to determine what levels are required to maintain mental health. Moreover, although it seems probable that such low levels of lithium in drinking water are far below the levels required to produce aversive and side effects, it is also important to assess side-effects of lithium in drinking water on thyroid function, pregnant women, the unborn, and other potent impairment.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) is the plasma membrane glycoprotein that mediates active iodide transport in the thyroid and other tissues, such as the salivary, gastric mucosa, rectal mucosa, bronchial mucosa, placenta and mammary glands. In the thyroid, NIS mediates the uptake and accumulation of iodine and its activity is crucial for the development of the central nervous system and disease prevention. Since the discovery of NIS in 1996, research has further shown that NIS functionality and iodine transport is dependent on the activity of the sodium potassium activated adenosine 5′-triphosphatase pump (Na+, K+-ATPase). In this article, I review the molecular mechanisms by which F inhibits NIS expression and functionality which in turn contributes to impaired iodide absorption, diminished iodide-concentrating ability and iodine deficiency disorders. I discuss how NIS expression and activity is inhibited by thyroglobulin (Tg), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and how fluoride upregulates expression and activity of these biomarkers. I further describe the crucial role of prolactin and megalin in regulation of NIS expression and iodine homeostasis and the effect of fluoride in down regulating prolactin and megalin expression. Among many other issues, I discuss the potential conflict between public health policies such as water fluoridation and its contribution to iodine deficiency, neurodevelopmental and pathological disorders. Further studies are warranted to examine these associations.</p>

<p>...</p>

<ol>
<li>Conclusions</li>
</ol>

<p>In summary, diverse lines of evidence demonstrate that F inhibits NIS expression and functionality thereby contributing to impaired iodide absorption, diminished iodide-concentrating ability and iodine deficiency disorders. Taken together, the findings of this study provide unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms by which F inhibits iodine uptake, transport and reabsorption, and provide a basis for minimising or preventing the risk of adverse health outcomes associated with iodine deficiency. The findings of this study further suggest that there are windows of susceptibility over the life course where chronic F exposure in infancy may influence long term iodine status and health outcomes in adulthood. Moreover, iodine deficiency in pregnancy can have profound implications on the health of offspring including risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, reduced IQ and greater risk of ADHD and ASD. In addition, loss of iodine bioavailability leads to lower antioxidant capacity, reduced anti-inflammatory capacity, impaired immunity and increased risk of cancer. Therefore, actions that prevent the risk of adverse health outcomes are essential to improve the health of the world’s population and to reduce health inequities. Based on the findings of this study, evidence strongly suggests that F ingestion contributes to pathological states by impairing iodine absorption and diminishing iodine concentrating ability. Whether or not public health practitioners and epidemiologists are ready to take up the implied challenge of these findings is, inevitably, related to the extent to which they are willing to continue to disavow the emerging evidence that F intake is associated with negative health outcomes for the sake of continuing a policy of fluoridation of drinking water that inadvertently may be contributing to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders, impaired immune responses, inflammatory diseases and cancer.</p>

<p>Low fat, high carb, low protein with lots of whole grain, fruits and vegetables. Red meat gives you cancer and heart disease.</p>

<p>In the report they have several pages outlining the issues with epidemiology yet they use incredibly specific numbers like 32-33% of calories should come from fat. How could you possibly reach a conclusion like that from epidemiology?</p>

<p>They recommend us to replace all types of saturated fat with seed oils but at the same time they they want us to consume as little trans fat as possible.

<p>Documents like these are very important because they influence what schools serve the children and what advice the government gives consumers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an expert so I&#39;m hoping someone can explain to me how they reach conclusions like that.</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>The recommendations are put together by groups of scientists from the nordic countries who review thousands of research articles and do systematic reviews with very strict rules regarding which studies are of good enough quality to be included. So no, not really based on the UK or US guidelines, they have their own way of doing it. Of course, the most recent version of NNR came out in 2012 so a lot has been researched since then that may change the overall outcome now. I think the new one should come out this year or next.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is that this is meant to be a guideline for feeding <strong>groups</strong> of people, not necessarily for individuals. There is so much variance in individual preferences and diet patterns and they specifically say that it is more so meant for planning school meals and stuff like that. I&#39;m not saying that these recommendations should be held as some sort of nutritional gospel, just pointing out that they do give reasoning as to how they came up with these conclusions.</p>

<p>From page 48 of the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 5th edition of the NNR is an update of the 4th edition from 2004 and focuses on the existing scientific evidence for updating the Nordic dietary reference values for nutrients in the context of a balanced diet. In the present NNR, an evidence-based approach has been adapted for deriving NNR reference values. For selected nutrients and topics, a systematic review (SR) has been used that includes a quality assessment of all pertinent studies and a final grading of the overall evidence. This approach has also been used as a basis for the food-based dietary guidelines. For the other nutrients and topics, an updated review has been undertaken using the documentation published in NNR 2004 as a starting point. In all reviews, data from observational and intervention studies have been used as the basis to estimate nutrient requirements for micronutrients and for establishing recommendations for optimal ranges of macronutrient intakes. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been used where possible. Animal and in vitro studies have been included when needed to explain mechanisms of action. Thus, the NNR values are based on the totality of the available evidence (3, 4).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Honestly from what I read it mostly focused on the &quot;limit intake of high fat diary, red meat, salt&quot; etc. not &quot;red meat gives you cancer&quot;. Those seem to be pretty rational guidelines as we know exchanging these foods for more veggies and whole grains does help health at population levels.</p>

<p>33% of calories from fat is not low-fat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given that seed oils can contain up to 4% trans fat, isn&#39;t that kind of contradictory?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trans fats are are present in small quantities in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat#Presence_in_food">many fatty foods</a>.  Also, the analysis you linked is quite an old study.  <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://aocs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1007/s11746-013-2234-z">This newer one</a> lists an analysis of trans fats in various oils in Table 4 and shows a trans fat level of 0-2% of total fats.  Most of this is due to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4609978/">heating process</a> (which is why EVOO was near 0%) so if you have, for example, a cold-pressed canola versus a heat-extracted canola, the trans-fat level is likely to also be near 0%. The trans fats in animal fats are due to <a href="http://www.jlr.org/content/43/2/290.full">biohydrogenation</a> (gut microbes converting cis-unsaturated fats into trans-unsaturates).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They recommend us to replace all types of saturated fat with seed oils</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they recommend replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats.  They list &#39;vegetable oils&#39; as possible sources of PUFAs but they also list olive oil, nuts, seeds, and fish.  </p>

<p>The reason that government organizations give such broad recommendations (such as including vegetable oils) is that they have to maintain a balance between providing &#39;optimal&#39; nutrition advice and nutrition advice that a population will actually follow.  For example, they could say to eliminate saturated fats AND seed oils, but then the diet would be restrictive enough that many people would give up and ignore it entirely.  So their goal is to remove the &#39;worst offenders&#39; and then encourage people to eat as much of the healthiest foods as possible while still allowing some less-than-ideal foods for people to fall back on.  You could phrase it as &quot;perfection is the enemy of good.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>In the Nordic countries, the TFA content of margarines and vegetable oil-
based fat spreads has decreased considerably during the last decades (to 
less than 1%) due to changes in raw materials and processing methods.</p>

<p>Also,regarding pufa -
In humans, high intakes of PUFA can potentially result in adverse ef-
fects including increased lipid peroxidation, impaired immune function, 
and increased bleeding tendency (21). Intakes of n-6 fatty acids (LA) up 
to around 10 E% are considered safe (or around 15-20 gm)</p>

<p>This is supported by the FAO report (13) that concludes that the ratio is 
of limited relevance when dietary intakes are within the recommended 
reference in</p>

<p>Also,omega 3 
Two grams per day 
of DHA has been shown to be superior to the same amount of EPA in 
erythrocyte membrane incorporation of both EPA and DHA, but an ALA 
intake of 4 g/d did not increase the proportion of these longer chain n-3 
fatty acids in a 6-wk intervention (28). There is also retroconversion of DHA 
to EPA and DPA. The estimated retroconversion rate varies between 1.4% 
and 12% depending on, for example, the DHA intake (29, 30).</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Regarding megadosing ,
Several meta-analyses of RCTs with supplements with high doses of 
nutrients with antioxidant properties have shown no protective effects 
on CVD, gastrointestinal cancer or mortality (18, 57–59). Analysis of 47 
high-quality studies included in the meta-analysis by Bjelakovic et al. (58) 
showed a significant increased risk of total mortality for β-carotene (7%), 
retinol (16%) and tocopherol (4%). Results from subsequent studies have 
failed to show any protection against cancer or CVD (60–62).</p>

<p>Red meat in particular has been a scare crow for so long that population studies now suffer from the &quot;healthy user bias&quot;, meaning that people that eat red meat are those that don&#39;t commonly listen to expert advice on health and so are more likely to engage in unhealthy habits like smoking.</p>

<p>And of course the scientists try to take that into account, however the behaviors that harm is an open and ever expanding set, so that&#39;s impossible.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s also the issue that epidemiological studies are based on food questionnaires where they ask you the frequency with which you ate specific items in the last year. The accuracy is of course awful, e.g. my food preferences change over time and I can barely remember what I ate last month.</p>

<p>My issue with nutritional guidelines is the sloppy science behind it. We get it, doing studies on humans is hard and expensive since you can&#39;t keep your subjects hostage or dissect them at the end of an experiment.</p>

<p>However you can&#39;t draw conclusions based on epidemiological studies. And it&#39;s irresponsible to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Because modern dietary opinion is currently anti-meat. It&#39;s a trend that will hopefully go away soon. It&#39;s confusing a lot of people.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Because animal protein is expensive and difficult to produce.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Also,regarding cholesterol </p>

<p>Cholesterol synthesis is highly regulated, and its 
uptake by cells reduces endogenous synthesis. About one gram of cho-
lesterol is synthesised in human adults every day, and this is 3 to 4 times 
the amount absorbed from the average adult Nordic diet.
The most important dietary sources of cholesterol are meat and of-
fal, eggs, and dairy products. The fractional absorption of cholesterol is 
reduced when the intake increases.</p>

<p>On average, 40% to 50% of dietary 
cholesterol is absorbed, but absorption varies between individuals and can 
range from 20% to 80%. 
According to a meta-analysis of 17 randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) published from 1974 to 1999 (24), 100 mg of 
dietary cholesterol increased serum total cholesterol by 0.056 mmol/L 
and HDL-cholesterol by 0.008mmol/L and slightly increased the total-
cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio by 0.020 units. In individuals with 
the apoprotein E4 allele, dietary cholesterol has a more pronounced effect 
on serum cholesterol concentration whereas in those without the apopro-
tein E4 allele dietary cholesterol has a weaker effect on serum cholesterol 
concentration (43).</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The two are not inconsistent, or at least it would seem so to me. ~50g protein per day is a normal amount for the average sedentary person. I don&#39;t think there&#39;d be any direct harm from this same sedentary person getting, say 75g per day, but the harm would be implicit in their having to either up their calories, or rearrange the dietary composition to favour more protein isocalorically, which would probably mean a meat-heavy diet (or isolated protein supplements), none of which are really in line with the totality of the recommendations.</p>

<p>If an individual doing resistance training upped their total calories and increased their protein consistent with the review you&#39;ve highlighted, that would seem to be fine, also.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What happens to dark bread and potatoes?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What&#39;s wrong with whole wheat bread and potatoes? And eggs do raise cholesterol.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Aren&#39;t Danes super fit on the whole though?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The sci hub link doesn’t work for me</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I know what you&#39;re talking about and here&#39;s my take on it. Is it scientifically accurate to say that red meat = bad based on epidemiology when we know about healthy user bias? No. But the nutritional guidelines serve another important role, to lead people that know very little about nutrition (and thus are probably eating like crap) to live healthier lives, these people today are the majority, if you look at population levels people are on average not healthy, they move to little and eat like shit so telling them to lower things like red meat, heavy fat diary etc will most likely lead them to eat less processed foods, loose some excess weight etc. These guidelines are for the average person, they are for population levels not for individuals who already know enough about nutrition to know that red meat on it&#39;s own isn&#39;t bad.</p>

<p>Telling someone who eats red meat, heavy diary, a ton of processed carbs etc to lower these and eat more whole foods instead is a good strategy for population levels. It&#39;s a good starting point for newbies and hopefully if they start there they might get curious and start reading up on nutrition and learn more about how things work on their own.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Ah, now I see!</p>

<div class="md"><p>What do you mean ?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not just any bread. Rye bread. I live in Denmark and the bread here isn&#39;t like the whole wheat bread. It&#39;s like legit whole food bread packed with seeds and nuts and so bloody delicious.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>eggs raise cholesterol in hyper sensitive individuals, but its been known for a long time that ingestion of cholesterol doesnt affect blood cholesterol to a degree that makes any difference in healthy people, nor is it considered as a valuable health marker by itself anymore.</p>

<p>I probably have a diet higher in cholesterol than anyone on reddit not living off animal brains (by eating tons of eggs and organ meats) and my cholesterol sits at 115 and trigs at 28.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p><em>&quot; It is critical to note that</em> 75% of the population appears to experience little or no alteration in plasma cholesterol concentration following challenges of high cholesterol intake (<em>12)</em></p>

<p>I think it&#39;s pretty safe to assume, based on the scientific evidence we have so far, that starch is not unhealthy. I don&#39;t know what perfectly healthy means, and why do you mention peanuts? Who adds fiber to potatoes? I don&#39;t follow.</p>

<p>Are you saying that there are better, more nutritious food items than boiled potatoes? If so, I agree.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>

<div class="md"><p>please detail the possible consequences of a diet high in potatoes and other starchy tubers. let&#39;s define high as &gt;300g of carbohydrates alone from these sources if you&#39;re not opposed.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I agree mostly. I am not very aware whether the quality of the meat matters much or not, but there is a terrible bias blaming meat for sure.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s completely unsustainable from an ecological perspective. Essentially, the world can&#39;t afford everyone to eat a high-protein diet.</p>

<div class="md"><p>the whole marketing of whole-grain/dark breads as healthy is as genius as diamonds being valuable. likewise the amount of artificially colouring white flour or using other methods to profit off this used in bakeries and grocery stores are as fascinating as they are terrifying.</p>

<p>breads and grains are amongst the top 3 dietary reasons people in my country (germany) are fat &amp; unhealthy but &#39;breakfast means bread!&#39; (marketed as &#39;breadtime&#39; by fucking nutella iirc cause nutella and the bread industry are dependent upon each other obviously) has been ingrained into the sugar and carb addicted minds of all classes.</p>

<p>anyone interested should dive into the psychological manipulation (of the senses as well) bakeries employ, which aren&#39;t the mom &amp; pop stores they&#39;re designed to appear as but basically mcdonalds.</p>

<div class="md"><p>My English is a little challenged with understanding &quot;please detail&quot; </p>

<p>And I can clearly see that my points, should have been written better. </p>

<p>Well, diet is nuanced thing, my problem with starchy food items such as potatoes, is that it greater affects the blood sugar. 300 g seems extreme for any one macro, bit fair enough. </p>

<p>The starch is easily broken down into sugars, and therfor has a heavy effect on insulin levels. </p>

<p>I was (ironically) not nuanced enough in my former statement, what I ment was that potatoes and the whole grain breads, are seen in such a way, that you can just eat all you want from them.</p>

<p>My personal diet of choice, is a low carb diet and all the fats I ingest, would not be good along starchy/sugary foods.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Grass fed/grass finished meat is definitely healthier and more nutritious, but it&#39;s far more expensive. I personally just buy grocery store chicken and pork when it&#39;s on sale, same with eggs. In the grand scheme of things, I don&#39;t think it makes that big of a deal, if you take care of yourself everywhere else in your life. The vitamin k2 mk4 you&#39;re missing out on by not eating grass fed I just supplement with.</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>Most people are sheep who will never think for themselves. I try to educate the few people who seek the truth. There will (hopefully) always be room and resources for such people. But I know the current economy and structure would collapse if everyone forsook processed food, as they should, and ate only meat and plants. So while we try to tell everyone what is truly healthy, we know the vast majority of people will never listen.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Also about this, since your country is my country. I do not completely agree about the Nutella though, or at least in my environment I do not see any Nutella (also not that much bread). But I am certainly interested in these topics, including the psychological manipulation that bakeries employ.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m well aware all these things are manipulations. A big one they all do is getting people to think pleasure=happiness, but they are in fact different. You can see this with many marketing campaigns. Pleasure is a dopamine hit, happiness is serotonin. Junk food full of sugar and such have been shown to spike your dopamine, which also fuels addiction. I found Lustig&#39;s lecture &quot;The Hacking of the American Mind&quot; most illuminating:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG_jtVWXj5g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG_jtVWXj5g</a></p>

<p>Do you have any things I can look at that go more in depth into bakeries and such?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Well this isn&#39;t really a scientific paper. How does this disprove metabolic ward studies? They state that egg consumption doesn&#39;t increase your CVD or all-cause mortality, which is different from what I claimed. I merely said that high cholesterol consumption increases your serum cholesterol.</p>

<p>They state that saturated fat increases serum cholesterol more than dietary cholesterol does, which is true and I agree with you there, dietary cholesterol doesn&#39;t increase serum cholesterol by a huge margin, but if your goal is getting your LDL as low as possible you should be eating no cholesterol.</p>

<p>Multiple studies controlling for baseline serum cholesterol and dietary cholesterol intake have proven this.</p>

<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/73/5/885/4739583">https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/73/5/885/4739583</a></p>

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>blood sugar isn&#39;t spiked that much by complex/starchy carbs, especially if you prepare (sweet) potatoes with lower/wet heat methods that cause less of a breakdown of starches.</p>

<p>potatoes are highest on the satiety index amongst carb foods, so I&#39;d wager overeating into a caloric excess is a lot more difficult than on any foods high in fat content, and ultimately bodyweight is one of the most important health markers, quite relevant regarding (pre)diabetes as well which is both super low fat and low carb diets work similarly well in recovering from t2 diabetes.</p>

<p>grains are a whole other topic and I exclude them from all of my clients nutrition when possible, I&#39;ve got no mercy for that crap</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Grass fed/grass finished meat is definitely healthier and more nutritious, but it&#39;s far more expensive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I obviously agree. I just would like to know how worse is the store-quality meat, and how that can affect on health, longevity and quality of life.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>yea I know everything by Lustig, he&#39;s well known in the nutritional science space like fettke, wolf, patrick, attia and so on</p>

<p>I havent bookmarked any of it I&#39;m afraid, the documentaries on youtube I saw were on bakeries in germany specifically, as the bread business here may be one of the most elaborate and high quality (potentially) in the world.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>ABSTRACT: In the US, 70% of pregnant women use an iron-containing prenatal supplement product; however, only 2.6% of pregnant women have iron-deficiency anemia and 16.3% are iron deficient. Yet, published data on the amounts and chemical forms of iron used in formulating these products are not available, although they are known to affect bioavailability. This information is especially important in comparing commercially available products with those that were tested in clinical trials. <strong>Our examination of nonprescription and prescription iron-containing prenatal supplement products in NIH&#39;s Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD) and DailyMed found the labeled amount of elemental iron ranged between 9 and 60 mg/serving in 148 nonprescription supplements and between 4.5 and 106 mg/serving in 101 prescription supplements. Ferrous fumarate was the preferred chemical form used in these products. In contrast, ferrous sulfate was the preferred chemical form of iron reported in the clinical trials summarized in a 2015 Cochrane Systematic review assessing the effects of daily oral iron supplements for pregnant women. Ferrous sulfate was not found on any prenatal supplement product label in the DSLD or DailyMed. The chemical forms of products on the market and those tested in clinical trials are dissimilar, and we believe this may have clinical implications.</strong> The findings raise several questions. Do outcomes in clinical trials correlate with the benefits and risks that might adhere to iron supplements with different iron formulations? Should the differences in chemical forms, their bioavailability, and safety profiles, be considered in greater depth when evaluating the effect of the various formulations on maternal iron nutriture? Should new clinical trials for pregnant and lactating women in the US use a form of iron not found in prenatal supplements sold in the US or should a more common form be used?</p>

<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/view-large/136381502">Table 2</a> has a good breakdown comparing clinical trial iron supplement forms to common dietary supplement forms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Table 2 shows that the chemical forms varied; 49% of the nonprescription and 44% of the prescription products used ferrous fumarate as the source of iron, 31% of the nonprescription and 14% of the prescription products used amino acid chelates, 5% of the nonprescription and 19% of the prescription products used carbonyl or elemental iron, and ∼25% used other or unspecified chemical forms. None used ferrous sulfate as the source of iron. The chemical forms also varied in the 61 studies reported in the 2015 Cochrane review (10); 59% used ferrous sulfate, 10% ferrous fumarate, 10% ferrous gluconate, and ∼21% other or unspecified chemical forms. Of the 8 studies conducted in the US, 80% used ferrous sulfate, 10% ferrous fumarate, and 10% ferrous gluconate.</p>

<p>Perhaps someone here has seen a good analysis of the various forms of supplemental iron (fumarate, sulfate, chelates, etc.)?</p>

<p>Abstract: Effects of berberine on glucose-lipid metabolism, inflammatory factors and insulin resistance in patients
with metabolic syndrome were investigated. Eighty patients
with metabolic syndrome treated in Linyi Central Hospital
from January 2017 to December 2017 were selected and
divided into control group (n=40) and observation group
(n=40). Patients in control group were treated with regular
therapy using the Western medicine and drugs, while those
in observation group, based on the treatment in control
group, were treated with berberine. Changes in relevant
indexes to blood glucose and lipid metabolisms and inflammatory factors were compared between the two groups.
The correlation of inflammatory factor with fasting blood
glucose, insulin resistance, triglyceride and total cholesterol
was analyzed. At 1 month after treatment, levels of fasting
blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose, insulin
resistance index and blood lipid indexes in both groups
were lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P&lt;0.05).
At 1 month after treatment, levels of fasting blood glucose,
2 h postprandial blood glucose, insulin resistance index and
blood lipid indexes in observation group were significantly
lower than those in control group during the same period
(P&lt;0.05). Moreover, levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α) in both groups at 1 month after treatment
were lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P&lt;0.05),
and they were lower in observation group at 1 month after
treatment than those in control group during the same period
(P&lt;0.05). Finally, hs-CRP was positively correlated with
fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol
and triglyceride. The combined application of berberine in
patients with metabolic syndrome can effectively regulate
blood glucose and blood lipid of patients, alleviate insulin
resistance and reduce the level of inflammatory response in
the body.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>

<p>Recommendations to use other criteria than N-balance for defining protein requirements have been proposed. However, little evidence to support other measures such as physiological functions is available.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE:</p>

<p>To investigate the effects of a usual (UP) versus a high protein (HP) diet on muscle function, cognitive function, quality of life and biochemical regulators of protein metabolism.</p>

<p>DESIGN:</p>

<p>A randomised intervention study was conducted with 23 healthy males (aged 19-31 yrs). All subjects consumed a Usual Protein (UP) diet (1.5 g protein/kg BW) for a 1-wk run-in period before the intervention period where they were assigned to either a UP or a High Protein (HP) diet (3.0 g protein/kg BW) for 3-wks with controlled intake of food and beverages. Blood and urine samples were taken along with measurements of physiological functions at baseline and at the end of the intervention period.</p>

<p>RESULTS:</p>

<p>The HP group improved their reaction time significantly compared with the UP group. Branched chain amino acids and phenylalanine in plasma were significantly increased following the HP diet, which may explain the improved reaction time.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION:</p>

<p>Healthy young males fed a HP diet improved reaction time. No adverse effects of the HP diet were observed.</p>

<p>full study: <a href="http://sci-hub.tw/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21239090">http://sci-hub.tw/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21239090</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>1.5 g/kg is already a protein-replete diet so it&#39;s unsurprising that the results were so poor. Marginally significant improvements in 2 out of 19 tests with a decrement in 1 out of 19 while the normal protein group saw significant improvement in BMI that wasn&#39;t seen in the high protein group. They even replaced junk carbs (pasta, rice, bread and juice) but that didn&#39;t help much apparently.</p>

<p>I wonder if the Danish Meat Assocation is bummed they funded a study that couldn&#39;t come up with better outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>They tracked BMI but not body fat %, triglycerides, cholesterol, etc. Weird choice. Also, I’m amazed at how similar they were able to keep the nutrient intake (Table 3). High protein diet was somehow slightly lower in saturated fat than the lower protein diet</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>nice. thanks</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>But, they wanted to study the effects of a high-protein diet on overall physical and mental well-being, in comparison to a normal-protein diet. </p>

<p>They were not focussing on BMI changes / weight loss; which is why they enrolled people who were already in the healthy BMI range. The normal-protein group&#39;s BMI improvement is just an extra side-effect, which they can study in the future if they want to. </p>

<p>Since they wanted to study physical and mental wellbeing, they checked a variety of parameters (alertness, sustained attention, language, etc.); and, they found out that a high-protein diet is as good as a normal-protein diet.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I agree with most of what you said but I dont understand why you would consider the weight loss as an improvement of the BMI. I mean they are in the healthy range anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>At least they published it even though the results were unremarkable.</p>

<p>I agree that the healthy volunteers already were eating sufficient protein, I think the overage they consumed during the study was simply excreted.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>3 Weeks isn&#39;t very long to see or not see side effects.  1.5g/kg seems pretty low and 3g of protein is fairly high.  Would be interesting to see results at 2-2.5g/kg and maybe study all three over a long period.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>1.5g/kg seems pretty low</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering that &quot;<a href="https://mennohenselmans.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/">1.8g/kg (0.82g/lb) is the point at which additional protein intake ceases to yield any benefits</a>&quot; for muscle building, I would consider 1.5 grams to be pretty high for a standard diet.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>But there are other benefits beyond muscle-building. Like, you won&#39;t build additional muscle beyond a certain point on a higher-protein diet, but you WILL realize body-composition benefits. Here&#39;s a link to an Examine.com link that supports intakes of 3.3g/kg of bodyweight: <a href="https://examine.com/nutrition/how-much-protein-do-you-need/">https://examine.com/nutrition/how-much-protein-do-you-need/</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>you WILL realize body-composition benefits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not quite.  As per the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Assuming progressive resistance overload and a mild hypercaloric diet (370–800 kcal above maintenance), a few studies suggest you’ll gain less fat if you eat more protein (3.3 g/kg rather than 1.8–2.6 g/kg), <strong>although one did not.</strong></p>

<p>What’s important to understand is that a daily protein intake of 3.3 g/kg isn’t likely to help you build more muscle than a daily protein intake of 1.8–2.6 g/kg. What the higher number can do is help you minimize the fat gains you’ll most likely experience <strong>if you eat above maintenance</strong> in order to gain (muscle) weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So IF you are an active bodybuilder or powerlifter and IF you are eating above maintenance then you <em>might</em> see benefits at those intake levels.  And unfortunately all of the extremely high protein intake research has only been done by Antonio, et al. so I am hesitant to put too much faith in it until it has been replicated by another research team.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Okay, let me re-word that for you:</p>

<p><em>More studies than not</em> suggest higher than .82g/lb <em>can</em> provide body composition benefits, whether bulking or sedentary, as well as greater muscle retention when cutting at a caloric deficit. 1.5g/kg is below optimal for most applications. 1.5 would not be considered &quot;high&quot; for the average diet.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>More studies than not suggest higher than .82g/lb can provide body composition benefits, whether bulking or sedentary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is is incorrect.  The Antonio studies were done on non-sedentary weight-training participants and the results of one of the two studies was insignificant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4715299/">there were no significant changes in body composition or markers of health in either group.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And while they did see benefits in the second study, their conclusions are also that high protein diets &#39;may&#39; infer benefits, not &#39;will&#39; infer benefits:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-015-0100-0">Consuming a high protein diet (3.4 g/kg/d) in conjunction with a heavy resistance-training program <strong>may</strong> confer benefits with regards to body composition.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3777747/">good study</a> on sedentary participants found no benefits equivalent to above 1.2 g/kg, and even the normal and high-protein group gained 50% of their weight as fat:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the regression line of protein intake and change in lean body mass, the protein intake required to prevent loss of lean body mass was 77.8 g/d (95% CI, 54.4–101.2 g/d)....The key finding of this study is that calories are more important than protein while consuming excess amounts of energy with respect to increases in body fat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And for: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>1.5g/kg is below optimal for most applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s actually only 0.1 g/kg below the maximal useful contribution to muscle building as suggested by <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/6/376">this 2018 meta-analysis</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Protein supplementation beyond total protein intakes of 1.62 g/kg/day resulted in no further RET-induced gains in FFM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is in weight-training individuals, which most of the population is not.</p>

<div class="md"><h2>Abstract</h2>

<div class="md"><p>I was just looking at this paper the other day. </p>

<p>When translating these findings to humans, we have this study:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2673798/">Long-term effects of calorie or protein restriction on serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentration in humans</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reduced  function mutations in the insulin/IGF-I signaling pathway increase  maximal lifespan and health span in many species. <strong>Calorie restriction (CR) decreases serum IGF-1 concentration by ~40%, protects against  cancer and slows aging in rodents.</strong> However, the long-term effects of CR  with adequate nutrition on circulating IGF-1 levels in humans are  unknown. Here we report data from two long-term CR studies (1 and 6  years) showing that <strong>severe CR without malnutrition did not change IGF-1  and IGF-1 : IGFBP-3 ratio levels in humans. In contrast, total and free  IGF-1 concentrations were significantly lower in moderately  protein-restricted individuals. Reducing protein intake from an average  of 1.67 g kg −1 of body weight per day to 0.95 g kg −1 of body weight per day for 3 weeks in six volunteers practicing CR resulted in a reduction in serum IGF-1 from 194 ng mL −1 to 152 ng mL −1</strong>. These findings demonstrate that, unlike in rodents, long-term severe  CR does not reduce serum IGF-1 concentration and IGF-1 : IGFBP-3 ratio  in humans. In addition, our data provide evidence that protein intake is  a key determinant of circulating IGF-1 levels in humans, and suggest  that reduced protein intake may become an important component of  anticancer and anti-aging dietary interventions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rodents on CR at any level of protein experience a 40% reduction in IGF-1, while human CR practitioners eating high protein (about 24%) had IGF-1 levels no different from BMI 25, Western diet controls. When reducing protein from 1.67 g/kg to 0.95 g/kg their IGF-1 dropped 25% to 150 ng/mL. A group of mostly raw food vegans with higher BMI and body fat eating 0.74 g/kg protein had IGF-1 levels below 150 ng/mL without calorie restriction.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, after the results of this study came out, the CR practitioners changed their diets to low protein (around the RDA), moderate methionine, with protein mostly from plants.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><h2>Highlights</h2>

<p>• Calorie restriction (CR) and protein restriction (PR) both have a positive effect on lifespan</p>

<p>• In rodents the effect of CR on lifespan is not explained by the simultaneous restriction of protein</p>

<p>• The response in mammals to CR and PR appears to be different to that in insects</p>

<p>• The key difference may be methodological, as insect studies generally involve dietary dilution as opposed to restriction. Caloric restriction may generate fundamentally different responses to calorie dilution</p>

<p>• We suggest future studies should adopt these different terms – Caloric restriction and Caloric dilution to accurately describe their experimental protocols</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Almost exactly 100 years ago Osborne and colleagues demonstrated that restricting the food intake of a small number of female rats extended their lifespan. In the 1930s experiments on the impact of diet on lifespan were extended by Slonaker, and subsequently McCay. Slonaker concluded that there was a strong impact of protein intake on lifespan, while McCay concluded that calories are the main factor causing differences in lifespan when animals are restricted (Calorie restriction or CR). Hence from the very beginning the question of whether food restriction acts on lifespan <em>via</em>reduced calorie intake or reduced protein intake was disputed. Subsequent work supported the idea that calories were the dominant factor. More recently, however, this role has again been questioned, particularly in studies of insects. Here we review the data regarding previous studies of protein and calorie restriction in rodents. We show that increasing CR (with simultaneous protein restriction: PR) increases lifespan, and that CR with no PR generates an identical effect. None of the residual variation in the impact of CR (with PR) on lifespan could be traced to variation in macronutrient content of the diet. Other studies show that low protein content in the diet does increase median lifespan, but the effect is smaller than the CR effect. We conclude that CR is a valid phenomenon in rodents that cannot be explained by changes in protein intake, but that there is a separate phenomenon linking protein intake to lifespan, which acts over a different range of protein intakes than is typical in CR studies. This suggests there may be a fundamental difference in the responses of insects and rodents to CR. This may be traced to differences in the physiology of these groups, or reflect a major methodological difference between ‘restriction’ studies performed on rodents and insects. We suggest that studies where the diet is supplied <em>ad libitum</em>, but diluted with inert components, should perhaps be called dietary or caloric dilution, rather than dietary or caloric restriction, to distinguish these potentially important methodological differences.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Second interesting thing: The weirdest part of the OP paper (Speakman) is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We suggest that studies where the diet is supplied <em>ad libitum</em>, but diluted with inert components, should perhaps be called dietary or caloric dilution, rather than dietary or caloric restriction, to  distinguish these potentially important methodological differences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Expanded here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A possible explanation for the unusual response of the mice studied by Solon-Biet et al. (2014) was the manner in which the restriction was applied, which was exceptional among studies of rodents (Solon-Bietet al., 2014). In all previous studies of CR in rodents, the subject animals are given a ration of food that is lower than the intake of an ad libitum fed control group. Details of the exact protocols vary, in particular when and how frequently the ration is delivered (reviewed in Speakman and Mitchell, 2011) but they all have in common a shortfall in the quantity (i.e.mass) of food eaten, relative toad libitum fed animals. In contrast, Solon-Biet et al. (2014)generated restriction by diluting the diet with indigestible cellulose. Hence, while the mice ingested fewer calories, they did so while ingesting almost twice as much mass of food (Solon-Biet et al., 2014). This difference may be critical, because a potentially key component of the response to CR is a stimulation of the hunger signalling pathways in the brain (Hambly et al., 2007, 2012;Lusseau et al., 2015). When components of these pathways are knocked out, the response to CR is attenuated (e.g.NPY null mice). Diluting the diet, rather than restricting the amount available, may potentially generate fundamentally different responses in the neuropeptide pathways that link restriction to its beneficial actions with respect to lifespan(Lusseau et al., 2015). For example, the patterns of response in gut hormones that regulate satiation and satiety, and direct vagal afferents that respond to gut distension,are likely to be very different in mice that are underfed, compared to those that voluntarily overeat a diluted diet. Indeed, the fact the animals fed the diluted diet do not completely compensate for the caloric deficit, in the presence of excess food, suggests that hunger signalling pathways are down- rather than up-regulated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s basically saying that if you (a mouse) calorie restrict, but eat a high fiber diet that is satiating instead of feeling constant hunger, CR does not work. But this hypothesis is based on only one study, and one mechanism - neuropeptide Y - with some evidence that it may attenuate the response to CR in mice.</p>

<p>The study (<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(14/">Solon et al 2014</a>00065-5#secsectitle0030)) tested 10 different diets with varying protein, carbohydrate, and fat content, further altered by adding indigestible fiber to some of the diets to decrease energy density for a total of 25 diets. They fed the diets ad-libitum and measured how much the mice ate, then how long they lived.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consequently, total energy intake was highest on those diets with low  protein and/or low carbohydrate content because compensatory overeating  to achieve the protein or carbohydrate intake targets was not counterbalanced by marked inhibitory effects of fat on total food intake.  </p>

<p>At 6 and 15 months, mice ate similar amounts of protein regardless of  the energy density of the diet, consistent with regulation to a protein intake target. However, at 24 months, which represents old age, mice ate  similar amounts of food regardless of the energy density of their  diets. This led to a reduction in the intake of energy and macronutrients in the old mice on the low-energy density diets and, conversely, increased intakes in old mice on high-energy density diets (<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(14">Figure S2</a>00065-5#app2)D).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the mice were not CR&#39;d, they were eating ad-lib, which meant that the low-protein mice ate more calories overall because of protein leverage. The high-fiber diets didn&#39;t decrease calorie intake at all in young mice, but they did in old mice; and the high fiber diets had the worst longevity regardless of macronutrient content - maybe because the mice couldn&#39;t eat enough when they got old? And this is what Speakman&#39;s analysis of no longevity benefit is based on. Finally, despite eating more calories in youth, the low-protein (but medium or high energy density) mice lived the longest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Median lifespan was greatest for animals whose intakes were low in protein and high in carbohydrate, but was not influenced by total calorie intake</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I think this calorie dilution thing is a very long shot.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Wait... Can you explain this? Reducing protein consumption, even with 0 reduction in total calorie consumption, results in a drop in IGF-1 levels?? This is wild, can you tl;dr a bit? Or link for a layperson?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Anecdotally, after the results of this study came out, the CR practitioners changed their diets to low protein (around the RDA), moderate methionine, with protein mostly from plants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m wondering if anyone has adapted similar dietary pattern but on the ketogenic side and using animal protein instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Well, the vegan group in the human study did eat fewer calories than the control group of nearly overweight people on a Western diet. Calories avg of 1980/day, Western diet 2505/day, calorie-restriction diet 1772/day. BMI&#39;s of each group: raw vegans 21-22, CR 19.8, Western 25. So this study involves both calories and protein, but it shows that even a severe calorie restriction won&#39;t lower IGF-1 if there&#39;s too much protein, and a mild amount of CR plus a low protein plant based diet achieved what some consider optimal IGF-1 for anti-aging.</p>

<p>There are more studies, like:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988204/">Low Protein Intake is Associated with a Major Reduction in IGF-1, Cancer, and Overall Mortality in the 65 and Younger but Not Older Population</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16965238">Effects of a low-fat, high-fiber diet and exercise program on breast cancer risk factors</a></p>

<p><a href="http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/11/11/1441">The Associations of Diet with Serum Insulin-like Growth Factor I and Its Main Binding Proteins in 292 Women Meat-Eaters, Vegetarians, and Vegans</a></p>

<p>The last one again compared vegans with meat eaters and found lower IGF-1 levels. </p>

<p>The summary is, different proteins have different ratios of the amino acids, and this determines how much they increase IGF-1 (I believe <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23216249">leucine</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22442749">does</a> so the most). Thus, lower protein overall will decrease IGF-1, but so will replacement with less anabolic protein sources. I think casein (a milk protein) stimulates IGF-1 the most, and plant proteins on average stimulate it less than animal proteins/also seem to upregulate another molecule that binds to IGF-1 and inactivates it (therefore a dietary switch from animal to plant reduces serum IGF-1).</p>

                  'by changes in protein intake, but that there is a separate '

                  'over a different range of protein intakes than is typical '
                  'in CR studies. This suggests there may be a fundamental '
                  'difference in the responses of insects and rodents to CR. '
                  'This may be traced to differences in the physiology of '

This paper presents a new concept and comprehensive review of leucine-mediated cell signaling explaining the pathogenesis of T2D and obesity by leucine-induced over-stimulation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1, a pivotal nutrient-sensitive kinase, promotes growth and cell proliferation in response to glucose, energy, growth factors and amino acids. Dairy proteins and meat stimulate insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling and provide high amounts of leucine, a primary and independent stimulator for mTORC1 activation. The downstream target of mTORC1, the kinase S6K1, induces insulin resistance by phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, thereby increasing the metabolic burden of β-cells. Moreover, leucine-mediated mTORC1-S6K1-signaling plays an important role in adipogenesis, thus increasing the risk of obesity-mediated insulin resistance. High consumption of leucine-rich proteins explains exaggerated mTORC1-dependent insulin secretion, increased β-cell growth and β-cell proliferation promoting an early onset of replicative β-cell senescence with subsequent β-cell apoptosis. Disturbances of β-cell mass regulation with increased β-cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as insulin resistance are hallmarks of T2D, which are all associated with hyperactivation of mTORC1. In contrast, the anti-diabetic drug metformin antagonizes leucine-mediated mTORC1 signaling. Plant-derived polyphenols and flavonoids are identified as natural inhibitors of mTORC1 and exert anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects. Furthermore, bariatric surgery in obesity reduces increased plasma levels of leucine and other branched-chain amino acids. Attenuation of leucine-mediated mTORC1 signaling by defining appropriate upper limits of the daily intake of leucine-rich animal and dairy proteins may offer a great chance for the prevention of T2D and obesity, as well as other epidemic diseases of civilization with increased mTORC1 signaling, especially cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, which are frequently associated with T2D.","DOI":"10.4239/wjd.v3.i3.38","extra":"PMID: 22442749\nPMCID: PMC3310004","libraryCatalog":"PubMed"}]

<p>Background
Dietary recommendations to limit red meat are based on observational studies linking intake to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk together with the potential of its saturated fatty acid (SFA) content to raise low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. However, the relation of white meat to CVD risk, and the effects of dietary protein source on lipoprotein particle subfractions, have not been extensively evaluated.</p>

<p>Objective
We tested whether levels of atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins differed significantly following consumption of diets with high red meat content compared with diets with similar amounts of protein derived from white meat or nonmeat sources, and whether these effects were modified by concomitant intake of high compared with low SFAs.</p>

<p>Methods
Generally healthy men and women, 21–65 y, body mass index 20–35 kg/m2, were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 parallel arms (high or low SFA) and within each, allocated to red meat, white meat, and nonmeat protein diets consumed for 4 wk each in random order. The primary outcomes were LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apoB), small + medium LDL particles, and total/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.</p>

<p>Results
Analysis included participants who completed all 3 dietary protein assignments (61 for high SFA; 52 for low SFA). LDL cholesterol and apoB were higher with red and white meat than with nonmeat, independent of SFA content (P &lt; 0.0001 for all, except apoB: red meat compared with nonmeat [P = 0.0004]). This was due primarily to increases in large LDL particles, whereas small + medium LDL and total/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were unaffected by protein source (P = 0.10 and P = 0.51, respectively). Primary outcomes did not differ significantly between red and white meat. Independent of protein source, high compared with low SFA increased LDL cholesterol (P = 0.0003), apoB (P = 0.0002), and large LDL (P = 0.0002).</p>

<p>Conclusions
The findings are in keeping with recommendations promoting diets with a high proportion of plant-based food but, based on lipid and lipoprotein effects, do not provide evidence for choosing white over red meat for reducing CVD risk.”</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hypothesis: &quot;Our primary  hypothesis was that on a high-SFA diet, red meat relative to other sources of protein would increase serum concentrations of LDL cholesterol, apoB, small and medium LDL particles, and the ratio of total/HDL cholesterol&quot;</p>

<p>Result: &quot;LDL cholesterol and apoB were higher with red and white meat than with nonmeat, independent of SFA content (P&lt;0.0001 for all,except apoB: red meat compared with nonmeat [P=0.0004]). This was due primarily to increases in large LDL particles, whereas small+medium LDL and total/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were unaffected by protein source (P=0.10 andP=0.51,respectively). Primary outcomes did not differ significantly between red and white meat. Independent of protein source, high compared with low SFA increased LDL cholesterol (P=0.0003), apoB(P=0.0002), and large LDL (P=0.0002).&quot;</p>

<p>The primary difference seems to be in large LDL, but the ARIC study has shown that increase of lb-LDL-C (non-SD-LDL) has 0 correlation with CHD: 2014 Small Dense LDL Cholesterol Concentrations Predict Risk for Coronary Heart Disease: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3999643/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3999643/</a> (see Fig 1 for easy reference). I&#39;m unsure what the justification of the conclusion is if there is not relevant difference in risk factors in that case.</p>

<p>Also, while LDL was lower based on protein, based on Table 3, so was HDL, resulting in apoB/apoA and TC/HDL ratios being the same (and the latter isn&#39;t significant based on protein source). Although there&#39;s a good P value for most of these, the SD variances are huge so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really possible to tease out much useful w/o the raw data. Table 4 does a better job of illustrating how minimal the differences are with particle counts or particle sizes.  If you had the raw data I think it might be interesting to plug the results into CVD risk calculators and see if there were any change in the results (I&#39;m sure they took weight and BP). In the abstract conclusion and the discussion the authors seems to make a much stronger position than seems warranted.</p>

<p>Interesting notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>All diets had about 40% carbs, 35% fat (interestingly, the main difference from baseline was just swapping 10% less carb for 10% more protein) - this is perhaps a good fit for those working within the parameters of the SAD, but this macronutrient mix probably doesn&#39;t shine any light when looking at high fat in relation to much lower-carb (or fat) consumption patterns.</li>
<li> I don&#39;t think the data is very well laid out as there isn&#39;t anything clearly showing changes from baseline to the various diets. You have to manually track the data between Table 1 and Table 2 (it also doesn&#39;t give data between washout periods - these were collected since they were adjusted for, but IMO, this makes it much harder than it should be to read). When do you do a comparison, it appears all dietary changes improved TC/HDL ratios (was it the -10%CHO? +10%PRO, change in food quality?).</li>
<li>All groups had 7% PRO from dairy, 2% PRO from egg; all cuts of meat were &quot;lean&quot;, grain-finished meat was used to better represent US meat consumption and fish was excluded to avoid confounding effects of n3 consumption. Low-SFA nonmeat had 20% more fiber than the other meals.</li>
<li>Ends with mentioning that there wasn&#39;t testing on atherogenic lipoprotein indices or clinical CVD outcomes looked at (the latter is understandable considering how short term the trial was, the former seems like a major shortcoming considering the study wants to draw conclusion of CVD benefit, but even my cursory look seems to question what those are).</li>
</ul>

<p>My conclusion: paper saved as another data point, but doesn&#39;t really say much interesting IMO.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Does anyone have access to the actual article? I&#39;m curious as to what specific diets they&#39;re using here. Some questions I have:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>is fiber kept constant between the three diets, or are the meat diets reduced fiber as a result of incorporating meat without increasing fiber elsewhere? Are macros in general kept constant?</p></li>
<li><p>How much meat is incorporated into the meat diet? Are they aiming for all (or a vast majority) of protein to come from meat, or does meat still represent a minority protein source?</p></li>
<li><p>what protein sources are they using in the plant based diet? Do we know what role nuts and legumes play in the diet used here?</p></li>
<li><p>How are &quot;red&quot; and &quot;white&quot; meats defined here? What particular animals are the white and red meat groups consuming?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Does this convince anyone to reduce their meat intake?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>No offence, but this seems heavily vegan biased. This isn&#39;t a real comparison study either, if you&#39;re including high saturated fat meats with high amounts of carbs vs low (I mean keto level not garbage 30% carbs) then we&#39;d probably see a different story over a LONGER period of time. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>This type of stuff needs to stop, there&#39;s an obvious agenda here and it benefits very few people.</p>

<p>Are you aware of any studies that show that on a ketogenic diet, SFAs won&#39;t negatively impact apoB level?</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>Not really, but for me, that is mostly because it didn’t affect small and medium size LDL particles.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Not in the slightest.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Not for me, if anything this made me feel a little better about meat. I try to limit my consumption somewhat and mostly eat dairy, eggs, fish, chicken, beef, pork and lamb, in that order. My quick ELI5 summary from the <a href="/r/nutrition">/r/nutrition</a> thread. Is my interpretation incorrect?</p>

<p>When you control for saturated fat intake, red meat and white meat consumption have the same effect on cholesterol, which is higher than vegetable protein consumption. But it doesn&#39;t matter because as the  researchers noted, &quot;higher concentrations of LDL cholesterol...are primarily attributable to increases in <strong>large, cholesterol-rich LDL particles</strong>...and as summarized elsewhere (34, 35), <strong>large LDL particles</strong>, measured by  several different methodologies, <strong>have not been associated with CVD in multiple population cohorts in contrast to the associations observed for concentrations of medium, small, and/or very small LDL</strong> (26,  36–38)...and Thus, the estimated impact of red meat, white meat, and dairy-derived SFA on CVD risk as  reflected by their effects on LDL cholesterol and apoB  concentrations may be attenuated by the lack of their effects on smaller LDL particles that are most strongly associated with CVD.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Nope, not at all.</p>

<p>Until the lipid hypothesis gets a shred of evidence, studies like this are a massive waste of time and money that could be going towards real medical research.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The lead author, Ronald Krauss, has received funding from the meat and dairy industry and has been a <a href="http://www.chori.org/Principal_Investigators/Krauss_Ronald/krauss_activities.html">member of various scientific association for dairy</a> (see section other activities at the bottom). Unlikely to be vegan biased. </p>

<p>He was a coauthor on the 2010 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20071648">meta-anlaysis</a> that first called into question the link between SFAs and cardiovascular diseases. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>What about his 2011 study ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Changes in atherogenic dyslipidemia induced by carbohydrate restriction in men are dependent on dietary protein source.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that multiple features of atherogenic dyslipidemia are improved by replacement of dietary carbohydrate with mixed sources of protein and that these lipid and lipoprotein changes are independent of dietary saturated fat content. Because epidemiological evidence suggests that red meat intake may adversely affect cardiovascular disease risk, we tested the effects of replacing dietary carbohydrate with beef protein in the context of high- vs. low-saturated fat intake in 40 healthy men. After a 3-wk baseline diet [50% daily energy (E) as carbohydrate, 13% E as protein, 15% E as saturated fat], participants consumed for 3 wk each in a randomized crossover design two high-beef diets in which protein replaced carbohydrate (31% E as carbohydrate, 31% E as protein, with 10% E as beef protein). The high-beef diets differed in saturated fat content (8% E vs. 15% E with exchange of saturated for monounsaturated fat). Two-week washout periods were included following the baseline diet period and between the randomized diets periods. Plasma TG concentrations were reduced after the 2 lower carbohydrate dietary periods relative to after the baseline diet period and these reductions were independent of saturated fat intake. <strong>Plasma total, LDL, and non-HDL cholesterol as well as apoB concentrations were lower after the low-carbohydrate, low-saturated fat diet period than after the low-carbohydrate, high-saturated fat diet period</strong>. Given our previous observations with mixed protein diets, the present findings raise the possibility that dietary protein source may modify the effects of saturated fat on atherogenic lipoproteins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was 30% carbohydrate but do you have evidence that it&#39;s different for a ketogenic diet?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Krauss a vegan? Are you aware of the funding he typically receives? A single google search would have shown how ridiculous that statement is. Even if he was funded by big broccoli instead of the animal agriculture industry I feel like this sub should actually review the methodology and results instead of making up reasons to dismiss a study.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The primary agenda of the study is to evaluate red meat vs. white meat, and finds there is very little difference between the two.  How does that &#39;benefit veganism&#39;?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The carbs in the study were carefully chosen and remained constant throughout the study both in total amounts and as a mixture of complex and simple carbs.  This study isn&#39;t designed to test fat based ketogenic diets.  It&#39;s to test protein sources in the context of a diet that closely resembles something an individual might eat on a regular basis.  If anything, reconstructing this diet to a high fat ketogenic diet would be less useful because it would apply to a very small segment of the population that follows a very peculiar diet practice.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Your comments really make no sense in the context of this study or Dr. Krauss historical work, as he&#39;s been previously funded by the beef industry and dairy council.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Interesting, I&#39;ll have to take a closer look at the MESA analysis, although it&#39;s worth noting that they don&#39;t necessarily conflict. The 2007 paper you referenced is specifically looking at analysis of MESA data for CIMT/subclinical atherosclerosis, while the initially referenced 2014 ARIC study results were focused on CHD endpoints.</p>

<p>While meta-analysis and systematic reviews can be useful, I also think care is needed as they are usually not as final,  conclusive, or unbiased as people might think. For example, the one you reference (which I haven&#39;t read, will queue it up) is coming from one institution, published in a non lipidology/cardiology journal, and is older (2009) in a rapidly evolving field. Here&#39;s a better overview article that shows clear differences amongst use of differing risk markers that you may find of interest: </p>

<p>Davidson, Michael H., Christie M. Ballantyne, Terry A. Jacobson, Vera A. Bittner, Lynne T. Braun, Alan S. Brown, W.Virgil Brown, et al. “Clinical Utility of Inflammatory Markers and Advanced Lipoprotein Testing: Advice from an Expert Panel of Lipid Specialists.” <em>Journal of Clinical Lipidology</em> 5, no. 5 (September 2011): 338–67. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacl.2011.07.005">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacl.2011.07.005</a>.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s also worth consideration that &quot;best predictor&quot; may also not actually count for much. For example, in this recent (2018) analysis with risk prediction vs actual (CAC scored CVD), it showed (Fig 1) that ~40% of the normolipidemia group had calcification (vs 55% of the hypercholesterolemia group). This seems to bear out in other studies: <a href="http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/70/24/2979">http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/70/24/2979</a></p>

<p>&quot;Subclinical atherosclerosis (plaque or coronary artery calcification) was present in 49.7% of CVRF-free participants.&quot;</p>

<p>WRT to studies on ketogenic diets and apoB (apoB/apoA *ratio* btw seems to be the relevant risk marker, not apoB measures alone), I haven&#39;t run across any studies focused on that specifically, but we know that CVD is multifactorial, and I think it&#39;s still safe to say, that if anyone&#39;s particularly interested in not dying of CHD rather than getting too worried about LDL, focusing on improving something like the deadly quartet via lifestyle modification is probably a better way to go: <a href="https://www.daxor.com/pdfs/quartet.pdf">https://www.daxor.com/pdfs/quartet.pdf</a></p>

<p>Note that that quartet is basically MetS and we can see then why CHD results seem to not improved despite the hundred billion dollars of statins prescribed: <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105">https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105</a></p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks, I don&#39;t have time to read it now but will get around to it soon. Also, the link in the OP works now. (It didn&#39;t seem to work for me when I tried to access it this morning)</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Oh thanks, for some reason I recall seeing &quot;You do not currently have access to this article.&quot; when I tried to view it through your link earlier today, and assumed it was stuck behind a paywall. I&#39;ll read through the full paper when I have a moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Large LDL particles are still atherogenic, just less so than small LDL particles. Considering all sizes are atherogenic the goal should be keeping all low.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Prospective epidemiology, randomized controlled trials using diet and/or drugs, genetic studies, and Mendelian Randomization studies all support the lipid hypothesis. You either haven’t been reading the literature or have a very strong cognitive bias.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious, what is your hypothesis for cardiovascular diseases and what are the evidences behind it?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Even prominent low-carbers <a href="https://cholesterolcode.com/guest-post-the-case-for-lower-ldl-on-low-carb/">admit lipid counts matter</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>People need to understand that a study result favoring a certain type of diet that they don&#39;t like isn&#39;t the same as bias. In that case anything showing any kind of significant result towards any direction would be bias, which is ridiculous.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It benefits veganism, vegetarian, and WFPB, because  many people who haven’t read the study will think “Well, white meat isn’t a good alternative either, looks like I️ should give up all meat and look towards plant based protein” 
That’s exactly what I️ would have thought 10 years ago.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks for those links!</p>

<p>As for your first one, they seem to be in agreement with what I am saying?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LDL subfractions: initial clinical assessmentand on-treatment management decisions1. </p>

<p>In patients with low risk (,5% 10-year CHD event risk), intermediate risk (5%–20% 10-year CHD event risk), CHD or CHD risk equivalent, premature family history of CHD in the absence of other risk factors, and in patients with established CHD who experience recurrent events despite appropriate therapy there is insufficient evidence to support LDL subfraction measurement for initial clinical assessment or on-treatment management decisions (rating: ‘‘not recommended’’).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Studies have linked large LDL particles to atherosclerosis in nonhuman primates,213 in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (who have an elevated concentration of predominantly large LDL particles),214 in participants of the population-based MESA study,215 in normolipidemic men with CHD,216 and among patients after MIin  the  Cholesterol  And  Recurrent  Events  (CARE)study.21</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the physiological rationale for the linkbetween LDL subfractions and adverse CVoutcome?</p>

<p><strong>All  lipoprotein  particles  in  the  LDL  fraction  are atherogenic, independent of size</strong>. LDL particles become trapped in the arterial wall and are internalized by macrophages through scavenger receptors on the macrophage surface, resulting in foam cell formation, activation of these foam cells and expansion of the inflammatory response.223 It has been proposed that small, dense LDL particles are more atherogenic than larger particles due to longer residence time in plasma, increased susceptibility to oxidation, enhanced arterial proteoglycan binding, and increased permeability through the endothelial barrier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which part of the paper do you think show that only small dense LDL-subfraction matter? I might have skip it. </p>

<p>As for the second paper, I know some people might not agree with this conclusion, but given that <em>normal</em> cholesterol level for non-westernized human should is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15172426">around 120mg/dl</a>, it could be that what is currently considered good is still too high.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(apoB/apoA <em>ratio</em> btw seems to be the relevant risk marker, not apoB measures alone)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d say this is probably true in people with metabolic syndrome, but in the healthy general population, apoB through LDL-p seem to catch most of the risk. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>focusing on improving something like the deadly quartet via lifestyle modification is probably a better way to go:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No disagreement from me, but I see no good reason to not also make sure that my LDL level is not higher than it needs to be. My lifestyle choices do not cause obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia or hyperlipidemia. I don&#39;t any to chose between any of that, I can take care of all of it at the same time. If one wants to do keto, why not do a more plant-based version of it? Althought it&#39;s much harder and probably not as satisfying. I can&#39;t see the rationnal for going heavy on the animal product and accept high LDL-c/p level.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Are you sure about that? The authors of this study seem to disagree. Am I misreading this?</p>

<p>&quot;In particular, as summarized elsewhere (34, 35), large LDL particles, measured by several different  methodologies, have not been associated with CVD in multiple population cohorts in contrast to the associations observed for concentrations of medium, small, and/or very small LDL (26, 36–38).&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I’ve noticed lots of people says it’s all inflammation which is ridiculous. It certainly plays a role and was once a decent sounding hypothesis but lots of studies have since come out disproving it as the central driver. Every cardiovascular researcher I’ve talked to said blaming inflammation is far far too simplistic.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>&quot;LDL cholesterol and apoB were higher with red and white meat than with nonmeat, independent of SFA content (P &lt; 0.0001 for all, except apoB: red meat compared with nonmeat [P = 0.0004]).&quot; </p>

<p>What is your Interpretation of their findings? it shows that a vegetarian diet decreases LDL Cholesterol or doesnt it?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Re: subfractions, I think the point specifically lies with LDL-C not being a great predictor/being contextual and other markers having more specificity. This is consistent with what we&#39;re seeing in terms of CVD and low LDL (this extends to coronary events as well, not just subclinical AS). And also from observations as far back as 2001: Low Triglycerides–High High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Risk of Ischemic Heart Disease <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/647239">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/647239</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Men with conventional risk factors for IHD have a low risk of IHD if they have low TG–high HDL-C levels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fig 1 is a great illustration of the very marginal improvements in CV risk across most of the major CV trials comparing event rates for those that have had interventional LDL-lowering and those that don&#39;t: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3697085/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3697085/</a> - it reflects some of the other studies I&#39;ve pointed to that shows that CVD happens irrespective of LDL levels.</p>

<p>The opposite also happens to be true if LDL is high but other markers are good. Eg 2016 Role of Coronary Artery Calcium Score of Zero and Other Negative Risk Markers for Cardiovascular Disease: The Multi-Ethnic Study Of Atherosclerosis (MESA)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Negative results of atherosclerosis-imaging tests, particularly CAC=0, resulted in the greatest downward shift in estimated CVD risk.</p>

<p>Or in 2018 Impact of Statins on Cardiovascular Outcomes Following Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring <a href="http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/early/2018/10/31/j.jacc.2018.09.051">http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/early/2018/10/31/j.jacc.2018.09.051</a>), where you can see that if CAC is zero, there&#39;s no impact on of LDL-lowering.</p>

<p>With regards of talking about non-MetS populations, I think it&#39;s an open question, but in practice, very few metabolically healthy individuals are going to have CVD-related mortality anyway, but the flip side seems more relevant considering that per that 2018 NHANES data analysis cited, that 70% have MetS under ATP III, and only 12% are &quot;metabolically optimal.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not particularly interested in convincing anyone of doing anything (besides critically reading the full-text of research published and putting it into context of what else they&#39;ve read, please do that!) but having gone through a fair share of my own research and drastically improving my personal health (I&#39;m in that 12% now, but I wasn&#39;t before), my general feeling about LDL is that it&#39;s a white rabbit that public/nutritional/medical health experts have been chasing for the past 50 years to the extreme detriment of almost every other metabolic health marker. I think that it&#39;s fine to have a low LDL, but there is also suggestive evidence that having high LDL wasn&#39;t a problem in the past, and may actually be beneficial, especially as people age. Eg this review, 2016 Lack of an association or an inverse association between low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and mortality in the elderly: a systematic review <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/6/6/e010401.full.pdf">https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/6/6/e010401.full.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>High LDL-C is inversely associated with mortality in most people over 60 years. This finding is inconsistent with the cholesterol hypothesis (ie, that cholesterol, particularly LDL-C, is inherently atherogenic). Since elderly people with high LDL-C live as long or longer than those with low LDL-C, our analysis provides reason to question the validity of the cholesterol hypothesis. Moreover, our study provides the rationale for a re-evaluation of guidelines recommending pharmacological reduction of LDL-C in the elderly as a component of cardiovascular disease prevention strategies.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It’s more of a theoretical argument. Any lipoprotein has the potential to enter the epithelium, theoretically. But I have yet to see any substantial evidence that I should be too worried about large LDL.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The simple answer is processed food is to blame. Inflammation, lipids, genetics, magic, or whatever you want to say the driving factor is, it&#39;s all because of bad food and poor lifestyle. Eat real whole food like fruits, veggies, and unprocessed meat bought raw. For bonus health lead a fasting focused lifestyle. Limit your stress and be happy.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Do you consider LDL-c irrelevant to the pathology or that there are other risk factors besides LDL-c? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the point specifically lies with LDL-C not being a great predictor/being contextual and other markers having more specificity.</p>

<p>Which markers do you have in mind? </p>

<p>From your first link </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There seems to be substantial biological support for our finding that a low TG–high HDL-C concentration is associated with a very low risk of IHD, whereas a high TG–low HDL-C concentration is a central risk factor of IHD. We think that our results should be considered with special reference to the absence or presence of the metabolic syndrome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>low hdl/high trig is the classic hallmark of metabolic syndrome. I think everybody would agree that suffering from it will increase your chance of CHD. Yet, what is one of the proposed mechanism (not the only one)? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The metabolic syndrome with high TG–low HDL-C concentrations has an effect on LDL particle size, density distribution, and composition, leading to a smaller and denser LDL particle22,23 that is more easily oxidized24 and thus much more atherogenic.25,26 The metabolic syndrome with high TG–low HDL-C concentrations includes an increased amount of TG-rich lipoproteins, some of which are very atherogenic, leading to progression of coronary artery lesions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it still come back to having elevated atherogenic lipoproteins, which appear to be a core requirement for atherosclerosis to happen. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s one thing if someone choose to believe that his LDL-c level are irrelevant because he is otherwise metabolicaly healthy, but the fact is that we have very little data to invalidate or confirm this and we have substantial evidence that high LDL-c is atherogenic. Again, I see no reason personally to accept high LDL-c/p level, and this is why on a population level we&#39;re nowhere close to see those recommendation. </p>

<div class="md"><p>Processing a food doesn’t inherently make it bad. What specific effect of processing is harmful?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>As you mention, there isn&#39;t so much data that is specifically disentangling when LDL-C levels are of concern (although the research with high HDL and low TGs are suggestive and point towards a consistent explanation of damage only being an issue when there is an inbalance of efflux and damaged (sd, ox) LDL) so we&#39;ll just have to wait and see for more definitive research, but to flip your question on its head - per your belief in the lipid hypothesis, if you could lower LDL-C alone, then there should be a significant effect on CVD, correct?</p>

<p>What if I told you that there was a class of drugs that could not only significantly decreased LDL-C but also significantly increased HDL-C with no benefit? In that case, that would mean that treating LDL-C as root cause, and not simply a marker or part of a symptom of a larger problem would be false, or at least extremely problematic? (I&#39;d hop so) Because this has actually been studied extensively (and I&#39;m not just talking about in the statin trials, although you&#39;d also expect a much larger result there as well). But there&#39;s a whole class of drugs, CETPs that does exactly this and has never been brought to market because it is wholly (rather than in the case of statins, as previously cited, only conditionally) effective.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;ll give you the full citation on these since this is worth a full read/chasing down (including references) if you are truly interested in digging into the rabbit hole, as these are results from a Phase III trial where there should be every incentive to find any excuse for this to be effective, and yet: Eyvazian, Vaughn A., and William H. Frishman. “Evacetrapib: Another CETP Inhibitor for Dyslipidemia with No Clinical Benefit.” <em>Cardiology in Review</em>, January 2017, 1. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/CRD.0000000000000137">https://doi.org/10.1097/CRD.0000000000000137</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evacetrapib  acts to decrease lipid exchange through CETP inhibition. CETP acts to  transfer cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol  (HDL-C) to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and  very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-C). HDL-C is involved in reverse cholesterol transport  and its blood levels have been shown to be inversely correlated with  cardiovascular risk. Thus, a pharmacologic agent that can elevate HDL-C  has been seen as an exciting area of research. In recent studies, evacetrapib  was shown to be safe and efficacious. It produced an increase in HDL-C  up to 128% and a 35% decrease in LDL-C, in comparison to placebo. In  addition, evacetrapib was also shown to be more potent than previous CETP inhibitors. HDL-C particles treated with evacetrapib  remained functional and had improved cholesterol efflux. A previously  studied CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, exhibited side effects of  hyperaldosteronism, manifesting in electrolyte disturbances, and  hypertension. These detrimental effects were not seen with evacetrapib. Recently, the results of evacetrapib’s  phase III ACCELERATE trial showed no significant reduction in major  adverse cardiovascular events or mortality, and the drug will not be  marketed.</p>

<p>Depending on how LDL is lowered, yes, there should be. Just chasing low number regardless of how its achieved would be shortsighted. </p>

<p>CETP inhibitor are a good example. Drugs can have unknown adverse effect that will confound the result. </p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5594181/">commentary</a> explaining why evacetrapib might not have work. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1706444">A more recent trial</a> using another CETP inhibitor did find that it decrease CHD events. </p>

<p>I feel the evidence converge pretty nicely all in the same direction, ie cholesterol level matter. </p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>&gt; Depending on how LDL is lowered, yes, there should be. Just chasing low  number regardless of how its achieved would be shortsighted.</p>

<p>OK, great, I think we can agree on that. Where we still differ, I think reasonable people can disagree depending on their take on the data, which is still developing, although I increasingly fall in the Ravnskov as I read more.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already cited the weaknesses of statins in terms of the effectiveness of the LDL-lowering (very effective) to CHD endpoints (very ineffective) or for primary prevention when there is not CVD (completely ineffective)! To me, this along with the CETP results mentioned simply underline that to lowering LDL-C dramatically simply does not have the effect you&#39;d expect if LDL-C was actually driving CHD (we&#39;ll see where PCKS9 leads - the studies show of course its even more dramatically capable of lowering LDL - lets see where the hard endpoints end up, especially as all studies show all-cause mortality increasing at the low physiologic levels).</p>

<p>In terms of why do statins work at all? I think there are a few things - statins does not just lower circulating LDL, but also lowers LDL transit times, which would reduce damaged sdLDL and oxLDL buildup. This seems pretty plausible within the multifactorial framework for CVD. Secondarily, we know that statins are anti-inflammatory agents, and there&#39;s been much recent research considering that (the chronic endothelial injury hypothesis is the other leading theory on CVD, which IMO actually ties in quite nicely with the parts of the lipid hypothesis that we&#39;ve observed to be true). It very neatly explains why high or low LDL-C can cause CVD, and, taking it back to where it started, neatly explains Krauss&#39;s observations on phenotype A vs B and all the subfraction results we&#39;ve seen. LDL-C in this lens is only predictive to the point where it accurately accounts for damaged LDL&#39;s ability to enter the endothilial layer and overwhelming the body&#39;s ability to extract it.</p>

<p>I think the real question is actually, why aren&#39;t statins <em>more</em> effective? It&#39;s very effective at lowering LDL-C, and Lipitor was the world&#39;s best selling drug. Besides the cross-sectional endpoint study already cited, I think that this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25672965">Diamond and Ravnskov</a> piece that kicked off my interest in this question is some worthwhile reading onthe topic. On JUPITER:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the public and healthcare workers were informed of a 54% reduction of heart attacks when the actual effect in the treated population was a reduction of less than 1 percentage point. Moreover, the ARR of 0.41 percentage points was the combination of fatal and nonfatal heart attacks. There was little attention paid to the fact that more people had died from a heart attack in the treatment group. Even experienced researchers may have overlooked this finding because the figures were not explicitly stated in the report. One needs to subtract the number of nonfatal CHD from the number of ‘any MI’ to see that there were 11 fatal heart attacks in the treatment group, but only six in the control group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From my research, the reasons that fit my model include that it turns out statins are awful for your insulin sensitivity <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00125-015-3528-5.pdf">https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00125-015-3528-5.pdf</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Statin treatment increased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 46%, attributable to decreases in insulinsensitivity and insulin secretion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And furthmore (related to the widespread myopathy), statins might be a net-negative due to their other mechanisms that can exacerbate atherosclerosis <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25655639">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25655639</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[S]tatins may be causative in coronary artery calcification and can  function as mitochondrial toxins that impair muscle function in the  heart and blood vessels through the depletion of coenzyme Q10 and &#39;heme  A&#39;, and thereby ATP generation. Statins inhibit the synthesis of vitamin  K2, the cofactor for matrix Gla-protein activation, which in turn  protects arteries from calcification. Statins inhibit the biosynthesis  of selenium containing proteins, one of which is glutathione peroxidase  serving to suppress peroxidative stress. An impairment of selenoprotein  biosynthesis may be a factor in congestive heart failure, reminiscent of  the dilated cardiomyopathies seen with selenium deficiency.</p>

<p>Anyway, if CHD were simple, it would have been solved already - it&#39;s certainly not from the lack of an army of much smarter and more dedicated people than us doing decades of research on the subject matter  so I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll come to an answer here, but I think this conversation is worth having specifically to point out that we won&#39;t get to the bottom of it, and that furthermore, there isn&#39;t necessarily an answer (certainly not one that has been effective at solving CHD). In that sense, I also think we&#39;re more in agreement than not - I&#39;m quite skeptical of any class of drugs being introduced that will &quot;cure&quot; heart disease, and your replies make me think we&#39;re on the same wavelength there. But just as we know that there are no drug treatments that cure MetS or T2DM but we do know of lifestyle/dietary modifications that (are clinically documented to) reverse MetS and T2DM, which also happens to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5928595/">improve almost all known CVD risk factors</a> as well. I&#39;d be very surprised if those result in worse hard endpoints, but I guess that&#39;s just something we&#39;ll need to be patient for in terms of acquiring the data and seeing the results.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Depends on the harmful substance. Whatever the method, we know they are bad for us and it&#39;s best to avoid them as much as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks for the great exchange! I do think we made quite clear where we both stand. Two things that I want to emphasize though </p>

<p>1) I make a distinction between what drives atherosclerosis (atherogenic lipoprotein seem heavily involved) vs what drives CHD incidences (lipids much less so - and this topic is even more complexe than atherogenesis). </p>

<p>2) I am not claiming that CHD is simple, and that there exist a simple solution. </p>

<p>I think my position is pretty reasonable. Given the high probability that LDL-p/c increase plaque burden, and given that I see no benefits for high LDL-c on any metrics, I choose to play it safe and make sure to keep my lipid within normal range. </p>

<p>If some people are fine with taking that bets that&#39;s on them, but as I said, with the current evidences that we have, this will never be recommended at a population level. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll see how it plays out as more evidence come forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yes, it was an interesting convo, although I feel like throwing something like &quot;no benefits for higher LDL-C on any metrics&quot; without any backing isn&#39;t a good way to get closure! I don&#39;t think it&#39;s settled, but there&#39;s plenty of evidence on either side (reverse causality and the relationship to people&#39;s &quot;default&quot; levels is the thing I think that&#39;s yet to be properly teased out as these are largely observational population studies, I&#39;ve excluded some of the most obvious versions of this like the Honolulu Heart Program results). From my POV, aiming for lower LDL-C is as much of a &quot;bet&quot; as the inverse (or rather, my take is maybe it doesn&#39;t much matter all that much or as posited by some of the research, the spontaneous change in cholesterol levels is what&#39;s important as a marker of health changes):</p>

<p>Why do you feel that what happens in the elderly is relevant to the general population? I&#39;m in my early 30&#39;s. <del>I don&#39;t think I should start increasing my cholesterol by eating more animal product based on some observational studies in people over 65 years of age.</del> [Poor argument, clearly this is not what you were suggesting. Yet the only thing that can be suggested from your elderly study is that we maybe should not actively try to lower LDL-c cholesterol in old age. Yet my evidence suggest that there is no concern - actual benefits - with keeping cholesterol low (normal level, really) throughout life.]  </p>

<p>The MONDO study found that higher TGs is associated with lower all-cause death risk, <del>would it be sound to conclude that eating lots of processed carbs to increase your TGs is good?</del> [same - still, this shows that those association should be interpreted with caution - I don&#39;t think you would agree that we can conclude from this that high TGs is beneficial].  </p>

<p>I think those observation can be pretty much explain by confounding factors, and I see stronger evidence to the contrary, so, I stand by my word that there is not strong evidence of any benefits from having high LDL versus the much stronger evidence that it can increase plaque burden.</p>

<div class="md"><p>As you rightly assume, I don’t think high TG is good and am a bit mystified by that result. As a matter of good practice I’ve of course collected lots of conflicting study results and often interesting patterns (or better understanding of mechanistics) result from unexpected findings (sometimes it’s just unreplicable, bad methodology, or just an outlier), but I think that including some of that in discussion is actually really worthwhile in this case as an illustration of why things aren’t that clear cut.</p>

<p>As for why I specifically think the elderly endpoints are useful it’s actually because they  <em>do</em> IMO look at the lifetime effect of cholesterol patterns (and specifically the relationship of ACM vs CHD) - many of the population studies track cholesterol on and ongoing basis, but some also simply based on early snapshots, which is fine since we’re simply testing for hypotheses - I think we’ll see some more interesting results as more people start mining larger data sets (like Feldman is doing with NHANES).</p>

<p>I think it’s also worth noting that LDL (and TG) are highly mobile - I’ve had 25%+ differences on testing done within a week (with equal fasting, relatively normalized diet). Those using Cardiocheks w/ more frequent testing report even bigger swings.</p>

<p>And since you’ve mentioned it, I think the question of what a “normal” level is, is worth pointing out - we largely don’t know what that is historically as LDL testing simply wasn’t available/done for most of the large population studies before we started modifying diets. I suppose that you could look at populations eating minimally processed foods with good metabolic health as a good proxy, but we also know there’s a large range for those eating traditional diets (Kitavans vs Tsimane vs Maasai etc). So we’re clear on the ranges, current treatment targets are for LDL &lt;100mg/dL and there’s a big push for &lt;70 now which seems quite low to me looking at the bend of the U-curve on ACM in the population studies I’ve seen.</p>

<p>If you start following someone at 60 for 10-15 years, how do you know what his lifelong cholesterol pattern were? </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t read it, here is a good review which make many observation explaining why hypercholesterolemia is at odd with our evolutionary heritage. </p>

<p>By today standard even the Masai on a diet rich in milk and meat had not too high cholesterol level (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4423666">this</a> paper has them at 174ml/dl) - a far cry from the number that we see in some ketogenic people, especially hyperresponder. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Maybe because that&#39;s around the cutoff points where <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14623804">no plaque progression have been observed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16533939">actually regressed</a> </p>

<p>Also, you still did not comment on the mendelian and prospective evidence showing clear longevity benefits for lower LDL-c level throughout life. How do you reconcile that we the observation that low LDL-c increases mortality into old age?</p>

CVRF freedom was defined as no current smoking and untreated blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg, fasting glucose <126 mg/dl, total cholesterol <240 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <160 mg/dl, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥40 mg/dl. A subgroup with optimal CVRFs (n = 740) was also defined as having blood pressure <120/80 mm Hg, fasting glucose <100 mg/dl, glycosylated hemoglobin <5.7%, and total cholesterol <200 mg/dl. We evaluated ultrasound-detected carotid, iliofemoral, and abdominal aortic plaques; coronary artery calcification; serum biomarkers; and lifestyle. Adjusted odds ratios (with 95% confidence interval) and ordinal logistic regression models were used.\nResults Subclinical atherosclerosis (plaque or coronary artery calcification) was present in 49.7% of CVRF-free participants. Together with male sex and age, LDL-C was independently associated with atherosclerosis presence and extent, in both the CVRF-free and CVRF-optimal groups (odds ratio [×10 mg/dl]: 1.14 to 1.18; p < 0.01 for all). Atherosclerosis presence and extent was also associated in the CVRF-free group with glycosylated hemoglobin levels.\nConclusions Many CVRF-free middle-aged individuals have atherosclerosis.

                  'Background Absence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) '
                  'is traditionally considered low risk for atherosclerosis; '
                  'however, individuals without CVRFs, as currently defined, '
                  'still have events.\n'
                  'Objectives This study sought to identify predictors of '
                  'subclinical atherosclerosis in CVRF-free individuals.\n'
                  'Methods Participants from the PESA (Progression of Early '
                  'Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study (n = 4,184) without '
                  'conventional CVRFs were evaluated (n = 1,779; 45.0 ± 4.1 '
                  'years, 50.3% women). CVRF freedom was defined as no current '
                  'smoking and untreated blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg, fasting '

                  'low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <160 mg/dl, and '
                  'high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥40 mg/dl. A subgroup '
                  'with optimal CVRFs (n = 740) was also defined as having '

                  'glycosylated hemoglobin <5.7%, and total cholesterol <200 '

                  'iliofemoral, and abdominal aortic plaques; coronary artery '

                  'Results Subclinical atherosclerosis (plaque or coronary '
                  'artery calcification) was present in 49.7% of CVRF-free '

Prespecified primary end points were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-four RCTs comprising 10 159 patients were included. Compared with no antibody, treatment with PCSK9 antibodies led to marked reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (mean difference, -47.49% [95% CI, -69.64% to -25.35%]; P < 0.001] and other atherogenic lipid fractions, and it reduced all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.45 [CI, 0.23 to 0.86]; P = 0.015; heterogeneity P = 0.63; I2 = 0%) and cardiovascular mortality (OR, 0.50 [CI, 0.23 to 1.10]; P = 0.084; heterogeneity P = 0.78; I2 = 0%).

Statins inhibit the synthesis of vitamin K2, the cofactor for matrix Gla-protein activation, which in turn protects arteries from calcification.

We recently reported that glycemic control in patients with T2D can be significantly improved through a continuous care intervention (CCI) including nutritional ketosis. The purpose of this study was to examine CVD risk factors in this cohort.\n\nMethods\nWe investigated CVD risk factors in patients with T2D who participated in a 1 year open label, non-randomized, controlled study. The CCI group (n = 262) received treatment from a health coach and medical provider. A usual care (UC) group (n = 87) was independently recruited to track customary T2D progression. Circulating biomarkers of cholesterol metabolism and inflammation, blood pressure (BP), carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), multi-factorial risk scores and medication use were examined. A significance level of P < 0.0019 ensured two-tailed significance at the 5% level when Bonferroni adjusted for multiple comparisons.\n\nResults\nThe CCI group consisted of 262 participants (baseline mean (SD): age 54 (8) year, BMI 40.4 (8.8) kg m−2). Intention-to-treat analysis (% change) revealed the following at 1-year: total LDL-particles (LDL-P) (− 4.9%, P = 0.02), small LDL-P (− 20.8%, P = 1.2 × 10−12), LDL-P size (+ 1.1%, P = 6.0 × 10−10), ApoB (− 1.6%, P = 0.37), ApoA1 (+ 9.8%, P < 10−16), ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (− 9.5%, P = 1.9 × 10−7), triglyceride/HDL-C ratio (− 29.1%, P < 10−16), large VLDL-P (− 38.9%, P = 4.2 × 10−15), and LDL-C (+ 9.9%, P = 4.9 × 10−5). Additional effects were reductions in blood pressure, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and white blood cell count (all P < 1 × 10−7) while cIMT was unchanged. The 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score decreased − 11.9% (P = 4.9 × 10−5). Antihypertensive medication use was discontinued in 11.4% of CCI participants (P = 5.3 × 10−5). The UC group of 87 participants [baseline mean (SD): age 52 (10) year, BMI 36.7 (7.2) kg m−2] showed no significant changes. After adjusting for baseline differences when comparing CCI and UC groups, significant improvements for the CCI group included small LDL-P, ApoA1, triglyceride/HDL-C ratio, HDL-C, hsCRP, and LP-IR score in addition to other biomarkers that were previously reported. The CCI group showed a greater rise in LDL-C.\n\nConclusions\nA continuous care treatment including nutritional ketosis in patients with T2D improved most biomarkers of CVD risk after 1 year.

                  'mortality in women. It also inversely predicted '

We aimed to investigate the association of 2 year (2002–2003 to 2004–2005) change in cholesterol with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a population-based cohort study.\n\nMethods and findings\nThe study population consisted of 269,391 participants aged more than 40 years who were free of myocardial infarction, stroke and cancer using the Korean National Health Insurance Service—National Health Screening Cohort. Cholesterol levels were classified into 1st, 2nd and 3rd tertiles during each of the first and second health examinations, respectively. The participants were followed-up for all-cause and cause-specific mortality from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2013.

<p>In my understanding, bomb calorimetry is the main way calorie information found on food packaging is determined. And my understanding is that the food product is burned in bomb calorimetry and the change in water temperature is measured.</p>

<p>I know enough chemistry and physics to think this is a somewhat reasonable yet deeply flawed process.</p>

<p>A particular flaw I haven&#39;t found any information on through cursory googling is the level of breakdown of the food in the bomb. To what extent are the bonds in the food broken? Are they burned until they simply won&#39;t anymore? </p>

<p>And in our bodies, to what extent would the same bonds be broken? In digestion it would appear (based on anecdotal evidence of corn pieces and green bits in stool) that the human body does not fully breakdown all of the produce products we consume. Does this mean we get more energy from highly processed foods that are easily broken down? Or that we absorb less than the number of calories listed on a packet of fresh veggies?</p>

<p>How is this accounted for in determining package info?</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>Bomb calorimetry was the basis of the Atwater factor, to come up with the &quot;exact&quot; 4-4-9 calorie counts for carbs, proteins and fats.</p>

<p>You are correct these values take nothing physiological into account.  How big or small an impact physiology has on those approximations isn&#39;t clear but what is clear is that those values are only approximate.  They are not exact.</p>

<p>There&#39;s the thermic effect of food.  &quot;Most studies measure diet-induced thermogenesis as the increase in  energy expenditure above basal metabolic rate. Generally, the hierarchy  in macronutrient oxidation in the postprandial state is reflected  similarly in diet-induced thermogenesis, with the sequence alcohol,  protein, carbohydrate, and fat. A mixed diet consumed at energy balance  results in a diet induced energy expenditure of 5 to 15 % of daily  energy expenditure. Values are higher at a relatively high protein and  alcohol consumption and lower at a high fat consumption. Protein induced  thermogenesis has an important effect on satiety.&quot;  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC524030/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC524030/</a></p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is incorrect. Calorie information is determined by measuring the amount of fat, protein, carbohydrates, and fiber in foods. Bomb calorimetry hasn’t been used for a long long time.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks! This is exactly the sort of thing I was looking for. I&#39;ll definitely take a look at the paper linked and I&#39;ll probably find some more good stuff in their references.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Bomb calorimetry was the basis of the Atwater factor, to come up with the &quot;exact&quot; 4-4-9 calorie counts for carbs, proteins and fats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source? We know how much energy carbs, protein, and fats provide by the biochemical reactions they undergo and the ATP they yield.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Ok good to know. What methods are used to measure the content of the foods? I assume it is highly variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Calories have nothing whatsoever to do with ATP generation by macros, that&#39;s the point.  Yes there is energy stored in those chemical bonds and yes, our body uses a range of metabolic pathways -- some more efficient then others -- to extract that energy.   As I mentioned elsewhere, sometimes macros are simply excreted, no ATP gained there!</p>

<p>&quot;The system for determining the energy value of foods was founded &gt;100 y ago by Atwater et al (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396444/#bib1">1</a>)  at the USDA Agricultural Experiment Station in Storrs, CT. More than  100 y later, the Atwater general factors are still widely applied to  foods to estimate energy content. During this past century, there have  been few, if any, studies reporting on the energy value of a whole food  within a mixed diet that could confirm the accuracy of Atwater&#39;s  coefficients.&quot; </p>

<p>The only improvements made were regarding &quot;digestibility&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;In 1955 Merrill and Watt published a  report to update the energy content of macronutrients according to the  class of food in which they were found, and this report was further  updated in 1973 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396444/#bib2">2</a>).  Merrill and Watt took into consideration that compounds in a given  class of macronutrient can differ in heats of combustion and that  macronutrients as found in different foods can differ in digestibility.  They proposed a series of energy values for macronutrients as found in  different food sources, and these were termed the <em>Atwater specific factors</em>.  Their proposed coefficients of digestibility for protein ranged widely,  from 20% to 97%, and for carbohydrate from 32% to 98%. The proposed  heats of combustion for protein (minus 1.25 kcal lost as urea) ranged  from 3.75 to 4.55 kcal/g, and heats of combustion for carbohydrate  ranged from 2.45 to 4.20 kcal/g. In contrast, the ranges of estimated  values for coefficients of digestibility and heats of combustion for fat  were much narrower, at 90–95% and 9.3–9.5 kcal/g, respectively.  Moreover, the majority of foods were assigned a coefficient of fat  digestibility of 90% and a heat of fat combustion of 9.3 kcal/g, which  suggests that there is little variation in the energy available in a  gram of fat, regardless of food source. Nuts are among the many food  groups assigned a coefficient of fat digestibility of 90% and a heat of  fat combustion of 9.3 kcal/g based, in part, on the work of Jaffa (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396444/#bib3">3</a>).  However, much evidence has surfaced that suggests that the  digestibility of fat from whole nuts (and peanuts, which are actually  legumes) may be much lower than that for other food sources (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396444/#bib4">4</a>–<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396444/#bib6">6</a>).&quot;</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>Each is measured individually. Iirc nitrogen analysis for protein, nonpolar solvent extraction for fat, vacuum oven dehydration for water content, combustion for ash/mineral content and the remaining weight is carbs.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks for the correction. Seems like a good system but nuts certainly need their coefficient adjusted</p>

2019-07-02 15:33:59,013 - __main__ - INFO - Scanning "Are there any studies that measure results for two diets with the same calories consumed but with entirely different foods?"
2019-07-02 15:33:59,194 - __main__ - DEBUG - Submission Full Text: 
"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For example, you have two people with similar attributes(size, weight, age, etc) and you have them both eat a 2000 calorie diet for a period of time. Subject A eats only boneless skinless chicken breasts and broccoli while Subject B eats only bagels with cream cheese.</p>

<p>I’m interested in how this pans out because I read about calories in vs calories out, but then you hear about certain carbs spiking insulin which can lead to weight gain. Just curious just how much the actual composition of your food matters if you’re eating the same amount of calories.</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure how to look up the study, but Dr Lustig talks about how they took obese children who ate processed food with refined sugar and who had metabolic syndrome, and changed their diet so they had no added sugar but still processed junk food and still calorically equivalent. They made sure the children stayed the same weight, and in just 10 days all parts of their metabolic health improved, all by simply removing added sugar. And they weren&#39;t even fasting.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/tHYu8NlWDLU?t=2226">https://youtu.be/tHYu8NlWDLU?t=2226</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yes there has been plenty. </p>

<p>The most up to date <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28193517">meta-analysis</a> on this subject found that, if you swap carbs for fat or vice versa while keeping calories and protein constant, it has not impact on weight loss. </p>

<p>For health, there could be room for more debate, but no such study will ever be done because you can&#39;t lock people in metabolic ward for 50+ years.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Short term calories in vs calories out is true, but people tend to simplify this way too much. Common proof of that is that guy who went on twinkies diet and still lost weight, the part they don&#39;t tell you is how shitty he felt at the end of the diet.</p>

<p>If you focus only on calories in and calories out you will start lacking micronutrients, which will slowly increase your hunger and will require you more and more will power to continue until eventually you will crash and burn.</p>

<p>The saying itself is rather pointless too, because it can&#39;t be wrong. In the first place people who say it only think about calories in part of the equation.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Kevin Hall did an actually useful study in a metabolic chamber where people either had refined food or whole foods.  The refined foods got fiber drinks so that the &quot;grams of fiber&quot; could look the same, but I personally think that was the telling factor.</p>

<p>The processed food people gained weight and the unprocessed people lost weight.  This was a crossover study, so it really does seem to be the foodstuffs and not the macros exactly -- except of course for fiber. If you have 45% of your calories from carbohydrates that do not contain any real fiber, you&#39;ll get fatter.  If you have 45% (or more) of your calories from whole food carbohydrates with their natural fiber, you lose weight.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t test various macro ratios though.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t just sugar, but specifically added refined fructose.  <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.21371">Isocaloric fructose restriction and metabolic improvement in children with obesity and metabolic syndrome</a></p>

<p>&quot;The menu was planned to restrict added sugar, while substituting other  carbohydates such as those in fruit, bagels, cereal, pasta, and bread so  that the percentage of calories consumed from carbohydrate was  consistent with their baseline diet, but total dietary sugar and  fructose were reduced to 10% and 4% of total calories, respectively.&quot;</p>

<p>Fructose is metabolized in the liver and stored easily as fat there, which causes a host of metabolic syndrome symptoms.</p>

<p>Even refined food like bagels was better than added fructose.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>For health, there could be room for more debate, but no such study will ever be done because you can&#39;t lock people in metabolic ward for 50+ years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>what makes you think that you need 50 years to see changes in health?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yea I know, I&#39;ve seen his video &quot;sugar the bitter truth&quot;. Nice job on finding the study!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Because even 5 years is too short when looking at hard end point from a prevention perspective. </p>

<p>Most chronic diseases develop over multiple decades. </p>

<p>Now if we are talking in the context of someone with an established diseases, I agree we don&#39;t need 50 years. But i&#39;m more interested in prevention.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a nice study.  And it highlights for me that the issue here is refined, added fructose.</p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t eat much fruit in order to maintain ketosis, however, the fructose in fruit is never going to be an issue for people (well, watch out for dried fruit).  The study substituted FRUIT and yet dropped the amount of fructose in the diet.</p>

<p>That bagel with cream cheese and an apple vs a bagel with cream cheese and a SODA.    The former improved metabolic disease biomarkers whereas the latter freaking caused them.</p>

<div class="md"><p>ABSTRACT</p>

<p>Background</p>

<p>At rest, omission of breakfast lowers daily energy intake, but also lowers energy expenditure, attenuating any effect on energy balance. The effect of breakfast omission on energy balance when exercise is prescribed is unclear.</p>

<p>Objectives</p>

<p>The aim of this study was to assess the effect on 24-h energy balance of omitting compared with consuming breakfast prior to exercise.</p>

<p>Methods</p>

<p>Twelve healthy physically active young men (age 23 ± 3 y, body mass index 23.6 ± 2.0 kg/m2) completed 3 trials in a randomized order (separated by &gt;1 week): a breakfast of oats and milk (431 kcal; 65 g carbohydrate, 11 g fat, 19 g protein) followed by rest (BR); breakfast before exercise (BE; 60 min cycling at 50 % peak power output); and overnight fasting before exercise (FE). The 24-h energy intake was calculated based on the food consumed for breakfast, followed by an ad libitum lunch, snacks, and dinner. Indirect calorimetry with heart-rate accelerometry was used to measure substrate utilization and 24-h energy expenditure. A [6,6-2H2]glucose infusion was used to investigate tissue-specific carbohydrate utilization.</p>

<p>Results</p>

<p>The 24-h energy balance was −400 kcal (normalized 95% CI: −230, −571 kcal) for the FE trial; this was significantly lower than both the BR trial (492 kcal; normalized 95% CI: 332, 652 kcal) and the BE trial (7 kcal; normalized 95% CI: −153, 177 kcal; both P &lt; 0.01 compared with FE). Plasma glucose utilization in FE (mainly representing liver glucose utilization) was positively correlated with energy intake compensation at lunch (r = 0.62, P = 0.03), suggesting liver carbohydrate plays a role in postexercise energy-balance regulation.</p>

<p>Conclusions</p>

<p>Neither exercise energy expenditure nor restricted energy intake via breakfast omission were completely compensated for postexercise. In healthy men, pre-exercise breakfast omission creates a more negative daily energy balance and could therefore be a useful strategy to induce a short-term energy deficit.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Please correct me if I’m interpreting this wrong but the more negative energy is because they ate less correct? Or did they find increased energy expenditure or decreased absorption? Seems like we have a lot of studies now that show if you skip breakfast you don’t eat enough later in the day to make up for that, which could be useful for some.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>In the discussion, they say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In contrast, breakfast omission before exercise (FE) was partially compensated for at lunch, but not further compensated for later in the day </p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Here, we also demonstrate that pre-exercise breakfast omission is not fully compensated for via nonexercise physical activity energy expenditure when this is based on objective measures of physical activity in a free-living environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yes, when they omited breakfast before doing exercise they did not eat as much later in the day to compensate, and also their nonexercise energy expediture was not as low so it resulted in a bigger energy deficit over a 24h period.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>dummy here.  But I interpreted it the same way.  Seems like yes, skipping a meal means less calories.  But if calories are equated, wouldn&#39;t that mean the same results?  Or am I missing something.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yes, if calories were equated, that would be useless, but this study specifically looked at what happen in a free-living context, ie, what people tend to do spontaneously. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same reason why free-living study find that higher protein intake leads to more weight loss. They have a satiating effect so people tend to spontaneously eat less and hence lose more weight.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I did something similar on a n=1 scale logging food. If i skip breakfast, I am less hungry throughout all day.. Big breakfast gives me apetite for the evening. People who hate counting calories really benefit from skipping breakfast.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES</p>

<p>The aim of the study was to determine the value of a cluster of metabolic risk factors in predicting mortality after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).</p>

<p>BACKGROUND</p>

<p>The “deadly quartet” of metabolic risk factors (i.e., obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia) has been associated with coronary heart disease in healthy population studies. The expected influence of the cluster on survival in secondary prevention remains untested overall as well as by gender.</p>

<p>METHODS</p>

<p>Patients with lipid profiles undergoing primary isolated CABG (n = 6,428) between 1987 and 1992 were followed a median of eight years. Cox models were used to evaluate all-cause mortality. Metabolic risk factors were incorporated as the sum of deadly quartet risk factors present in each patient (0 to 4). The role of gender as it relates to survival and metabolic risk clusters was also examined.</p>

<p>RESULTS</p>

<p>The sum of deadly quartet risk factors showed a significant relationship to mortality as the hazard ratio increased from 1.64 (confidence interval [CI] = 1.34–2.01) for one risk factor to 3.95 (2.73–5.69) for four risk factors. Annualized mortality ranged from 1% per year in patients with no risk factors to 3.3% per year in patients with all four risk factors. Within gender, the hazard ratio associated with four risk factors was 2.58 for men and 13.39 for women. The expected clustering of risk factors was 8% compared to the observed clustering of 10% in men and 21% in women.</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS</p>

<p>This cohort showed risk factor clustering beyond that expected due to chance, particularly in women. Even after revascularization, survival is diminished for patients with members of a family of metabolic risk factors at the time of surgery.</p>

<p>The “deadly quartet” (obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia) was characterized by Kaplan (1) with inspiration from Reaven (2), who defined the metabolic syndrome. This grouping of known metabolic risk factors is highly associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) (3,4), and typically viewed as associated with insulin resistance (5). The increase in risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) as the number of risk factors progressively increases has been well documented (6). However, the demonstration of clustered risk in the primary prevention setting cannot necessarily be extrapolated to secondary prevention efforts. Although a recent analysis characterized risk clustering and 16-year outcomes in the follow-up of the healthy population of the Framingham cohort (7), both the degree of clustering and its impact on mortality have not been characterized in those with established coronary artery disease (3).</p>

<p>Separating the contributions of each of these factors to atherogenic risk has been complex. There is evidence that the members of the deadly quartet interact with one another as they relate to CHD (8–12), and even potentially represent a common metabolic abnormality (5). Defining the ultimate influence on mortality of some or all members of this metabolic quartet in patients with CHD could reshape current treatment strategies in secondary prevention (13–15). Such risk stratification could also be factored into decisions related to the benefits associated with surgical revascularization procedures (i.e., coronary artery bypass surgery). For example, the presence of diabetes, one member of the quartet, has already been reported to lead to greater mortality and event rates after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) (16–18).</p>

<p>We examined the post-CABG registry at the Cleveland Clinic to determine whether the deadly quartet resulted in increased mortality over the average eight years of follow-up. Further, we explored the role of gender in the susceptibility to these clustered risk factors.</p>

                  'overall as well as by gender.\n'
                  'METHODS\n'
                  'Patients with lipid profiles undergoing primary isolated '
                  'CABG (n = 6,428) between 1987 and 1992 were followed a '
                  'median of eight years. Cox models were used to evaluate '
                  'all-cause mortality. Metabolic risk factors were '
                  'incorporated as the sum of deadly quartet risk factors '
                  'present in each patient (0 to 4). The role of gender as it '
                  'relates to survival and metabolic risk clusters was also '
                  'examined.\n'
                  'RESULTS\n'
                  'The sum of deadly quartet risk factors showed a significant '
                  'relationship to mortality as the hazard ratio increased '
                  'from 1.64 (confidence interval [CI] = 1.34–2.01) for one '
                  'risk factor to 3.95 (2.73–5.69) for four risk factors. '
                  'Annualized mortality ranged from 1% per year in patients '
                  'with no risk factors to 3.3% per year in patients with all '
                  'four risk factors. Within gender, the hazard ratio '
                  'associated with four risk factors was 2.58 for men and '
                  '13.39 for women. The expected clustering of risk factors '
                  'was 8% compared to the observed clustering of 10% in men '
                  'and 21% in women.\n'
                  'CONCLUSIONS\n'
                  'This cohort showed risk factor clustering beyond that '
                  'expected due to chance, particularly in women. Even after '
                  'revascularization, survival is diminished for patients with '

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Abstract— Isocaloric feeding of diets varying in lipid content to albino hairless mice has shown that their susceptibility to skin tumorigenesis induced by simulated solar UV light was not affected by the level of polyunsaturated fat, 5% or 20%. However a qualitative effect of dietary lipid was demonstrated. Mice fed 20% saturated fat were almost completely protected from UV tumorigenesis when compared with mice fed 20% polyunsaturated fat. Multiple latent tumours were detected in the saturated fat‐fed mice by subsequent dietary replenishment, suggesting that a requirement for dietary unsaturated fat exists for the promotion stage of UV‐induced skin carcinogenesis.</p>

Various diets fed either during the initiation stage or the postinitiation (promotion) stage of carcinogenesis were evaluated for their ability to modulate the incidence of pancreatic cancer. Male Wistar/Lewis rats were treated with multiple injections of the pancreatic carcinogen, azaserine, during a 6- to 7-week-long initiation phase and were autopsied after a postinitiation phase of 34 or 44 weeks. The following diets were evaluated for their effects on the incidence of pancreatic neoplasms during each stage of carcinogenesis: high saturated fat; two high unsaturated fats (corn oil and safflower oil); low protein; and caloric restricted. A purified control diet was fed during that stage when the test diets were not fed. The incidence of pancreatic adenomas and adenocarcinomas was evaluated by light microscopy. Feeding of the caloric-restricted diet during the initiation phase suppressed the pancreatic neoplasm incidence. None of the ther diets tested had an effect on the incidence of pancreatic cancer during the initiation phase. During the postinitiation phase, both high-unsaturated-fat diets but not the high-saturated-fat diet significantly elevated the pancreatic neoplasm incidence. The low-protein and caloric-restricted diets had no effect on the neoplasm incidence when fed during the postinitiation phase.

Four basal diets deficient in selenium were used: (a) 1% corn oil; (b) 5% corn oil; (c) 25% corn oil; and (d) a high saturated fat diet containing 1% corn oil and 24% hydrogenated coconut oil. The comparable selenium-adequate diets were obtained by adding 0.1 ppm of selenium to each of the basal diets.

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h2>&gt;Abstract</h2>

<h3>&gt;Background</h3>

<p>&gt;While several studies suggest beneficial effects of lower sodium on cardiovascular disease, the relationship with total mortality remains controversial. Some have reported a J-shaped curve, but this may be due to poor quality measurement of sodium or confounding bias.</p>

<h3>&gt;Objective</h3>

<p>&gt;To examine the relationship of well-characterized measures of sodium intake, estimated from urinary sodium excretion, with long-term mortality.</p>

<h3>&gt;Methods</h3>

<p>&gt;Two trials [Phase I (1987-90) over 18 month and Phase II (1990-5) over 36 months in the Trials of Hypertension Prevention] implemented sodium reduction interventions. Multiple 24-hour urines were collected from pre-hypertensive adults aged 30-54 during these trial periods. Post-trial deaths were ascertained over a median 24 years through December 31, 2013 using the National Death Index. The association of mortality with both the randomized intervention and average sodium intake was examined.</p>

<h3>&gt;Results</h3>

<p>&gt;Among 744 Phase I and 2382 Phase II participants randomized to sodium reduction or control, 251 deaths occurred, with a nonsignificant 15% lower risk in the active intervention (hazard ratio (HR)=0.85, 95% CI=0.66-1.09, p=0.19). Among 2,974 participants not assigned to an active sodium intervention, 272 deaths occurred. There was a direct linear association of average sodium intake with mortality, with HR=0.75, 0.95, 1.00 (reference), and 1.07 (p-trend = 0.30) for &lt;2300, 2300-&lt;3600, 3600-&lt;4800, and &gt;=4800 mg/24hr, respectively, with HR=1.12 per 1000 mg/24hr (95% CI = 1.00-1.26, p=0.05) and no evidence of a J-shape or nonlinear relation. The HR per unit increase in sodium/potassium ratio was 1.13 (95% CI = 1.01-1.27, p=0.04).</p>

<h3>&gt;Conclusions</h3>

<p>&gt;This study, with carefully characterized measures of sodium intake, found an increased risk at high sodium intake and a direct relation with total mortality even at the lowest levels of sodium intake. Overall, these results are consistent with a benefit of reduced sodium and sodium/potassium on total mortality over a period of over 20 years.</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>In discussing  sodium intake after reading [Urinary sodium excretion measures and health outcomes] <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30232-6/fulltext">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30232-6/fulltext</a> I made my opnion that one should salt food to taste for optimal health. A friend and physician disagreed with me citing the above linked article <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5098805/?fbclid=IwAR3Nn01iDCCpC_P9LVzsZkTilCeg1SIyjyEnw6-tHK7DW_9qhWhsU2XLzfA">Sodium Intake and All-Cause Mortality over 20 Years in the Trials of Hypertension Prevention</a> </p>

<p>I was quite confused by this article and the ultimate conclusions of the authors as the data did not (to me) support their position.   I&#39;m confused why the authors are reporting non-significant findings as if they were significant &quot;HR for mortality by randomized intervention group was 0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) =0.66-1.09, p=0.19).&quot; </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Am I simply missing something here?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Side question: How do people&#39;s blood pressure get so high in the first place? Is it total lack of potassium and chronic dehydration? I swear I eat 5+g of sodium a day, but my blood pressure is low. I exercise and get a decent amount of potassium from potatoes. I honestly feel like my blood pressure might even be too low at times.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m confused why the authors are reporting non-significant findings as if they were significant </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems to be the standard in nutrition science these days.  The difference was 8% vs 9%, not even worthy of a statistical hiccup.  The charts on the study are exactly the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>One explanation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Insulin can increase blood pressure via several mechanisms: increased renal sodium reabsorption, activation of the sympathetic nervous system, alteration of transmembrane ion transport, and hypertrophy of resistance vessels.&quot; 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7512468/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7512468/</a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yea it&#39;s the potassium.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Are you young? Age is a significant risk factor for blood pressure, just like for cholesterol. People can have the same exact diet and behavior over time and BP will go up.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Seems to be the standard in nutrition science these days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How many studies can you cite where they reported non significant findings as significant? Saying this is the standard is completely unfounded </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The difference was 8% vs 9%, not even worthy of a statistical hiccup. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not how statistics work, you can’t just call a certain % change a hiccup or assume it was noise </p>

<p>You constantly bash peer reviewed science but don’t seem to understand it . The logical fallacy of incredulity comes to mind</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Bingo. Aldosterone can&#39;t do its job without enough potassium</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>That makes sense. I can&#39;t see people getting more than 10-20% of the daily potassium requirements eating only processed foods.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Age is a significant risk factor for death. So yeah. Not only diet happens in 70 years of living.:)</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I call garbage what it is: garbage.</p>

<p>Look at these graphs: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5098805/figure/F1/?report=objectonly">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5098805/figure/F1/?report=objectonly</a></p>

<p>You seriously want to defend that 1 line is awesome and the other is horrible?  If these were stocks would one of them make you rich and the other tank your portfolio?</p>

<p>What makes this study garbage is the conclusions.  if they were honest and said &quot;we found nothing&quot; then the study would be fine.  instead they reported &quot;significant results&quot; that follow the conventional wisdom to make sure they can $ecure funding for their next garbage $tudy.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>But was there a change? The CI and Pvalue don&#39;t seem to indicate there was</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Exactly. It&#39;s the ratio that&#39;s important. This is why low salt diets show improvement because the ratio is closer to 1:1. But we need salt which is why low salt diets rarely cure the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You seriously want to defend that 1 line is awesome and the other is horrible?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends what you mean by defend? The authors don’t claim those results are significant and neither do I.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What makes this study garbage is the conclusions. if they were honest and said &quot;we found nothing&quot; then the study would be fine. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn’t find nothing. They found some non significant results and some statistically significant results. That’s what almost every study with multiple comparisons and analyses finds. I couldn’t care le$$ about your con$piratorial line of thinking, especially when you don’t appear to understand the statistics. Logical fallacy of incredulity keeps coming to mind.</p>

<p>“In analyses of the sodium/potassium ratio, there was a significant trend across categories of &lt;2, 2-&lt;3, 3-&lt;4 and 4+ with HRs of 0.81, 0.86, 1.00 (reference), and 1.28, respectively (p for trend = 0.033). The trend was slightly attenuated after further adjustment for baseline characteristics to 0.90, 0.86, 1.00, and 1.20, respectively (p for trend = 0.14). In a comparison of the lowest (&lt;2) to the highest (≥4) category, the HR was 0.75 (95%CI = 0.47-1.20).

</div>
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m capable of reading the results, but that do not answer my question. 
My issue is that their statements don&#39;t jive with the stats.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This finding was statically significant </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The trend was slightly attenuated after further adjustment for baseline characteristics to 0.90, 0.86, 1.00, and 1.20, respectively (p for trend = 0.14). In a comparison of the lowest (&lt;2) to the highest (≥4) category, the HR was 0.75 (95%CI = 0.47-1.20). </p>

<p>But after adjusting for other variables was no longer a statistically significant and was no longer a linear relationship. </p>

<p>So what gives?</p>

<p>This is not significant either after adjusting for other variables.</p>

                  '\n'
                  'Methods\n'
                  'Two trials [Phase I (1987-90) over 18 month and Phase II '
                  '(1990-5) over 36 months in the Trials of Hypertension '
                  'Prevention] implemented sodium reduction interventions. '
                  'Multiple 24-hour urines were collected from '
                  'pre-hypertensive adults aged 30-54 during these trial '
                  'periods. Post-trial deaths were ascertained over a median '
                  '24 years through December 31, 2013 using the National Death '
                  'Index. The association of mortality with both the '

                  'Results\n'
                  'Among 744 Phase I and 2382 Phase II participants randomized '
                  'to sodium reduction or control, 251 deaths occurred, with a '
                  'nonsignificant 15% lower risk in the active intervention '
                  '(hazard ratio (HR)=0.85, 95% CI=0.66-1.09, p=0.19). Among '
                  '2,974 participants not assigned to an active sodium '
                  'intervention, 272 deaths occurred. There was a direct '

The coexistence of insulin resistance and hypertension can be viewed as a cause-effect relationship (insulin resistance as a cause of hypertension or vice versa) or as a noncausal association. Insulin can increase blood pressure via several mechanisms: increased renal sodium reabsorption, activation of the sympathetic nervous system, alteration of transmembrane ion transport, and hypertrophy of resistance vessels. Conversely, hypertension can cause insulin resistance by altering the delivery of insulin and glucose to skeletal muscle cells, resulting in impaired glucose uptake. For example, hypertension can impair vasodilation of skeletal muscle as a result of vascular structural changes and rarefaction, and increased response to vasoconstrictor stimuli. Also, the prevalence of muscle type 2b fibres (fast twitch fibres) may contribute to the development of insulin resistance. The common pathogenetic mechanism for both insulin resistance and hypertension could be activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This results in vasoconstriction, and may contribute to the genesis of vascular structural changes and increase the number of fast twitch fibres. Finally, hypertension and insulin resistance can be viewed as a noncausal association, according to the following hypotheses: 1) they may represent 2 independent consequences of the same metabolic disorder (intracellular free calcium accumulation), or 2) insulin resistance is a genetic marker and/or a pathogenetic mechanism of multiple metabolic abnormalities frequently associated with hypertension.","DOI":"10.2165/00003495-199300462-00024","extra":"PMID: 7512468","libraryCatalog":"PubMed"}]

2019-07-02 15:35:11,718 - __main__ - DEBUG - Submission Full Text: 
"
<div class="md"><p>Cholesterol Code is a pro-low carb blog written by an amateur researcher who generally advocates that low HDL and high triglycerides are the primary cause of CVD. Dr. Spencer Nadolsky is a former &quot;cholesterol denier&quot; who accepts the scientific consensus that LDL still matters. The blog&#39;s author wanted an outside perspective contrary to his claims to be presented on his blog in an effort to present &quot;the other side&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Early in residency training I reached out to experts like Dr. Dayspring and went to NLA meetings where they were all able to show me with much more convincing data that my LDL-hypothesis skepticism was uninformed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He cites several scientific references, interviews, and articles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://peterattiamd.com/tomdayspring1/">Dr. Dayspring on Peter Attia’s podcast</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.118.009778">good quick recent review of the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29712560">Low carb diets can SOMETIMES increase LDL</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6173254/pdf/bmjsem-2018-000429.pdf">Dave Feldman of cholesterol code discusses the hyper-responders pdf warning</a></p>

<p><a href="https://cholesterolcode.com/lccholesterolchallenge-six-month-update/">Dave has posted a contest about finding a study that shows increased CVD risk when one has high HDL-C (above 50 mg/dL) , low triglycerides (below 100 mg/dL), and high LDL-C (above 130 mg/dL)</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034273">So far this contest question hasn’t been answered. We have many studies that adjust and use statistical analyses showing that LDL-C is an independent risk factor, but we don’t have a pooled cohort looking at his exact question. There are a few reasons for this as I will discuss. I thought I had found one in this recent paper that just came out from the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.022335">A recent prospective epidemiological study looked at the FH phenotype (LDL-C greater than 190 mg/dL) compared to non FH subjects and found a significant accelerated risk of atherosclerosis</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633353/">It’s not just unfair to make a direct comparison of FH to Hyper-responders for the reason of lifelong burden of LDL-C/P, but also because there may be other issues going on that increase atherosclerosis in these genetic situations. Those with FH may have changes in monocyte activity after retention of the LDL-particle within the artery</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>His hypothesis for low carb hyper responders:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>A decrease in LDL receptor activity and also increased lipoproteins from excess saturated fat and paucity of polyunsaturated fat.</li>
<li>A very low insulin state which would also decrease LDL receptor activity and potentially increase apoB formation.</li>
<li>A non oxidative pathway for ketones is cholesterol.</li>
<li>Ketogenic dieters have increased intakes of dietary cholesterol which does increase LDL cholesterol levels despite what some have said in the past.</li>
<li>Low soluble fiber intake may increase dietary and bile cholesterol absorption.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Continuing....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are multiple [mendelian randomization] studies showing that all genomic variation being equal, those SNPs that are associated with high LDL are very likely causally associated with CVD and longevity. Anyone who disputes these results doesn’t understand the gravity of this evidence.</p>

<p>So going back to the hyper-responder phenotype of elevated LDL particles. We have no reason based on genetic data that the increase in apoB/LDL particles is benign. We have only reason to believe it’s harmful.</p>

<p>Remember the studies done on LDL receptor genetic differences above? Well drugs that  increase LDL receptors have been shown to lower cardiovascular events. Take a look here (see graph).</p>

<p>The lower you bring your LDL particles via drugs that increase LDL receptor the lower your risk of vascular events.</p>

<p>I’m not advocating that everyone needs to take drugs. I am just answering the question at hand, which is do increased LDL particles increase risk of cardiovascular disease. Everything I have shown points to yes. Does this answer the question of whether increased LDL particles in the hyper-responder phenotype increase risk of cardiovascular disease? Not exactly, but it should give us some big clues.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Its not addressing the higher priority issue which is all cause mortality.</p>

<p>The question should be Why can ldl correlate with improved longevity despite  it also correlating with worse cardio outcomes?</p>

<p>Until they ask that question, we are all skirting around the real issues.</p>

<p>For example sydney diet heart study. <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e8707">https://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e8707</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Having read the whole article, I first commend Dave Feldman for his commitment to open discussion and openness to listen to the “other” side. While he’s promoting his theory, he isn’t doing it in an echo chamber void of contrasting thought. Say what you will, but few in the nutrition/lipids universe seem willing to do so. </p>

<p>That said, Nadolsky lost credibility with me when he tried to equate Dave’s LDL “boat” correlation into LDL crashing into harbors and causing arterial intima damage. He leads into this by saying something to the effect that IF these harbors are damaged or rough, LDL particles will fix themselves there and with ApoB eventually cause atherosclerosis. This seems so wrong as he’s describing a damaged environment that LDL is attaching itself to but then claiming the LDL causes the damage. His own description seems to defeat his presentation of the prevailing (traditional) idea that LDL causes atherosclerosis. If the “harbor” is irregular or damaged in the first place, the root cause is not LDL, but inflammation due to any number of causes. </p>

<p>Further weakening his argument (which BTW, is not just his but all of traditional lipidology), he gives the latest approach that it’s not the LDL that’s the problem it’s the high LDL particle count. Errr, no it’s the high ApoB count. Or is it the high Remnant C count? This underscores the reality that the ball keeps moving with blame assignment moving every year. </p>

<p>I do appreciate and wish to correlate all the “Science” on this subject but based on all I’ve seen, I don’t trust the herd goals of those producing the “proof” of the LDL causation theory. I also understand all those who are on the fence and choose to mitigate their own particle constituents in what ever way they want to. After all depending on your age, high LDL is either good or bad, right? (LOFL!).</p>

<p>Personally, I applaud Dr. Nadolsky for following his mind and cooperatively contributing to the conversation. You don’t have to agree with him but you should understand his POV. As he (I think) admits, while his (pro low-carb) mind is made up, there is room for alternative thinking that we all wish to reconcile.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I tire of discussions where people measure their righteousness by the number of studies they can post to support their POV in a short time. If that’s what constitutes “science” to you then you excel at it. I do appreciate you’re diligence to get the last word and win at study-posting but your about as open to alternatives as Stalin was to democracy. My final LDL thought for you is if it’s such a dangerous molecule that lipidologists have deemed it necessary attempt to drive it completely out of existence, why did nature allow it to evolve in our bodies?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thank you for your great summary!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Its not addressing the higher priority issue which is all cause mortality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All cause mortality is important but it fails to capture quality of life and health span. We have gotten very good at keeping people alive after cardiac events like strokes and MIs but half of these patients gain a disability in the process (1)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The question should be Why can ldl correlate with improved longevity despite it also correlating with worse cardio outcomes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lifelong exposure to ldl cholesterol is what causes atherosclerosis. A single measurement is just a snapshot of a fluctuating number. High lifelong LDL exposure does not correlate with improved longevity, low lifelong exposure is causally related to increased longevity and health outcomes. One reason why LDL is lower in people with chronic diseases is disease lowers cholesterol levels (reverse causality). Nobody is skirting around this, it’s well known you just haven’t been paying attention to the literature (2)</p>

<p>The Sydney diet heart study is not a reliable piece of evidence </p>

<p>“The Sydney Heart Study35 was unique among the diet trials on CVD because a margarine high in trans unsaturated fat was a major component of the diet for participants assigned to the high polyunsaturated diet. When this trial was conducted, there was little recognition of the harms of trans unsaturated fat in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, so the researchers inadvertently tested substitution of saturated with an even more atherogenic trans fat. As predicted from current knowledge about trans unsaturated fat, CVD events were higher in the experimental group. If anything, this trial confirmed the results of observational studies that also report higher CVD risk from results from regression models in which trans unsaturated fat replaced saturated fat.41,42”</p>

<p>nor is the Minnesota coronary survey which is a nothing study lipid deniers like to cite </p>

<p>“The Minnesota Coronary Survey34 compared high polyunsaturated with high saturated fat diets in patients hospitalized for mental illness. The participants were given the assigned diets only when they were patients in the hospital. Because hospitalization for mental illness became less common and less prolonged after the study started, as a national trend, the patients received the assigned diets intermittently, contrary to the intent of the researchers, and for a much shorter time than planned. The researchers originally enrolled 9570 participants in the trial and intended to study them for at least 3.6 years to be able to adequately test the effect of the diets. However, the trend toward outpatient treatment of mental illness resulted in ≈75% of the participants being discharged from inpatient care during the first year of the study. Only about half the remaining patients stayed in the study for at least 3 years. The average duration was only 384 days. The incidence of CHD events was similar in the 2 groups, 25.7 and 27.2 per 1000 person-years in the control and polyunsaturated fat groups, respectively. A recent reanalysis of this trial restricted to the participants who remained in the trial for at least 1 year also found no significant differences in CHD events or CHD deaths.39 We excluded this trial from the core group because of the short duration, large percentage of withdrawals from the study, and intermittent treatment, which is not relevant to clinical practice. Another concern is the use of lightly hydrogenated corn oil margarine in the polyunsaturated fat diet. This type of margarine contains trans linoleic acid, the type of trans fatty acid most strongly associated with CHD.40” (3)</p>

<p>Dyslipidemia is one of the many causes of endothelial dysfunction. Other causes include inflammation, aging, smoking, etc.</p>

<p><em>Dyslipidemia and endothelium-dependent relaxation in internal mammary arteries used for coronary bypass surgery</em></p>

<p>“A 1 mmol increase of total cholesterol was associated with a 11.2% decrease of endothelium-dependent relaxation (P=0.006). When total cholesterol was omitted from the model, LDL-cholesterol became the best predictor of endothelium-dependent relaxation (regression coefficient 10.3%/mmol; P=0.02). No other variable was significantly associated with endothelium-dependent relaxation, and none of the preoperative variables was associated with endothelium-independent relaxation, expressed as the response to sodium nitrite (10 mM). Conclusion: Our study showed that endothelium-dependent relaxation in apparently non-diseased internal mammary arteries used for coronary bypass surgery was independently related to preoperative (LDL)-cholesterol levels.”

<p>So to be clear this doctor lost credibility in your eyes because you have a misunderstanding of a basic phenomenon?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>One core tenet of this sub is to use scientific evidence when discussing a subject. I don&#39;t think people are trying to measure their rightneousness by doing so. If there are multiple studies supporting one&#39;s point, what&#39;s wrong with posting many of them? </p>

<p>This might not be a philosophy you agree with and as such, maybe this sub might not be a good fit for you? </p>

<p>We have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bqi550/posting_guidelines/?st=jwlzjska&amp;sh=1618dfe5">Posting Guidelines</a>. Please make sure to read them and if you choose to engage on this sub, expect that people will use evidence - maybe many - while discussing things with you, and keep in mind that they will also expect you to provide evidence when making a claim and explaining why you disagree with their evidences by using counter-evidence or explaining the limitation of the evidence they used. </p>

<p>Again, nothing wrong with disagreeing with the idea of using studies when making a point, but if you choose to hang around (which I hope you will since I think we have a very pasionnate and respectful community!) just beware that this is expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Well the 8lives dude has been claiming and proving LDL being causal for years now. And actually the majority of the science is still on his side, since the majority of science is done with interest to promote statins. For the time, we cant really deny LDL plays a role. Looking at the evidence it does, but causality was claimed only with the help of mendelian randomization, which is such a complex approach, that the results can be easily skewed by something that we don&#39;t know yet about certain genotypes. The lipid system seems too complex to be dependant on a single variable. Also CVD is still increasing as a whole, while we have all the LDL focused treatment. That&#39;s why I am sceptical that LDL is a causal factor, there is also not a single study which found that other markers were more significant than LDL alone for CVD risk. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the evidence suggests that a high LDL-c/HDL-c ratio, but not the individual lipoprotein components, is associated with an increased risk of SCD. Further studies are needed to replicate these associations and assess the mechanistic pathways underlying the relationships.</p>

<p>The multivariate analysis by logistic regression OR gave 1.3 ± 0.79 (p = .0001) for TG/HDL-c, 0.779 ± 0.074 (p = .0001) for HDL-c, and 1.234 ± 0.097 (p = 0.03) for LDL. Analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves showed that only TG/HDL-c and HDL-c were useful for detecting extensive coronary disease, with the former more strongly associated with disease.</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>If I understood your post, you’re presenting the idea that LDL is one of several (many) initiators of endothelial inflammation.  This I accept if the LDL is oxLDL. But that’s not what we are being told. We’re being told that LDL is the main cause of atherosclerosis (to what degree is not explained).  </p>

<p>The article essentially says LDL is casual because it buries into damaged endothelium. Did I misunderstand that? If that’s right, what came first?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I believe <a href="/u/tsarman">u/tsarman</a> wanted to say that when there is a wall of text for reply, its very hard to answer with quality. Then it seems that the side, which cites an overwhelming amount of studies is winning the debate, while it may be that the sheer amount of text serves to dilute the dynamics of a discussion. Some posters have in advance prepared answers for discussions and post the same things over and over again. While it is scientific, I could actually call it science bullying and not a constructive debate. However, it ultimately boils down to who has more time to defend his approach.</p>

<p>The likelihood that all the genes related to LDL-c have the same or different confounder that all also affect CHD risk is extremely slim. This is one of the strength of mendelian studies. They are not your typical observational studies and it takes much more than a possible unknown confounder to explain them away, and they strongly support a causal role for LDL-c in atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Doesn’t really matter what you accept when it’s widely recognized that LDL is a causal factor of endothelial dysfunction, unless you have damning evidence to the contrary.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I agree with you but keep in mind that there&#39;s no obligation to answer all of the evidences presented. Just 2 days ago someone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bwq6z1/effects_of_red_meat_white_meat_and_nonmeat/eq4qf7j/?st=jwmaiqto&amp;sh=85f7a46b">answered</a> me with 10 studies. </p>

<p>Should I have criticized him for citing too many papers? And would that have helped my case? </p>

<p>I agree with you that it&#39;s harder to properly answer a comment that has many citations, and ideally one claim would be backed with one citation, but otherwise you can answer just 1-2 and provide counter-evidence and then leave it at that. Hopefully people that come to this sub take the time to read the evidence referenced and don&#39;t judge the quality of an answer based on the number of pubmed link. It should be rapidly obvious if someone is linking many irrelevant paper and easy to point out, then it&#39;s that person who&#39;s loosing credibility.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks for your supportive comment!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Since we know that heart disease is a multifactorial disease stating LDL is causal prompts an issue: how causal? And can it be causal in some contexts and irrelevant in others? Cause it seems so, because Dave Feldman is still waiting for his study, where high hdl, low tg, high ldl people would have statistically higher risk for CVD. If LDL would be the sole factor, then it would be fine. There are tens of factors, in a lot of studies LDL alone has lesser importance than other dynamic factors like tg/hdl ratio, LDL/HDL ratio and so on. While LDL is needed to have atherosclerosis, because thats how the system works, can we really say that LDL is the cause of it? can be that malfunction of the lipid system as a whole uses LDL to cause CVD. On paper LDL is still the hand doing the crime, but it doesnt really have a motive, it was told to do it. Thats the beef about it. LDL looks like hivemind citizens: they can be told to do one or another, but a higher mind is probably behind. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>risk is extremely slim</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet there still is a chance that we dont know something major regarding lipids and the genes involved. And we are curing the symptoms instead of the real cause. Yes, simptoms also kill, but treating symptoms doesnt help to heal.</p>

<p>In overall my response is more rhetorical questioning than really claiming something. It just feels that fat avoidance didnt really help us getting healthier as a whole. And it seems a lot of LDL treating lifestyle interventions have other major health risks, which usually are hardly worth it.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Likewise. You do you, believe what you want. I’ve seen enough to carry skepticism vs. swallowing what the majority believe. Remember the earth was flat for a long time - everyone believed it. I’ll stay with the deniers for now. Good to know you stand with the anointed.</p>

<p>Just 2 days ago someone answered me with 10 studies.</p>

<p>Just wanted to thank you for the link to the conversation. It was actually as interesting to read as it is to see a professional lecture about the topic. :) edit: the main thing - the opponent didnt force you to answer all of those. He just provided them to prove the strength of a single point. What I would say is toxic science citing: quoting different studies with different points, which mixes everything up. About the credibility part I agree, sometimes time shows best.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>How causal is cigarette smoking for lung cancer? Can you smoke and never get lung cancer? Yes right? If I propose you a hypothesis that I am convince that if x factor and y factor are respected, you can smoke and never get lung cancer, will you take the chance? </p>

<p>If we agree that high LDL-c plays a role in the disease (you seem in agreement with that), why would you take any chance and walk around with high LDL-c when this can be avoided? What do you gain by doing this? </p>

<p>Keep in mind that nobody is seriously arguing that LDL-c is the sole, only risk factor for CHD. That&#39;s a strawman. It just so happen to be a pretty important one for the disease to progress. High trig are also bad. High blood sugar is also bad. Infection can play a role. Iron overload can play a role. Stress does too. Smoking is another one. </p>

<p>The evidence for high LDL not being a problem as long as you don&#39;t have inflammation and/or good metabolic health (low trig/high HDL-c) are pretty much non-existant a this moment. It&#39;s interesting, but speculative. </p>

<p>Again, are you willing to take the chance? I&#39;m not.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Siding against the preponderance of evidence isn’t skepticism its denying science. You’ve provided no evidence that only oxLDL promotes endothelial while I’ve provided half a dozen studies that you’ve seemingly ignored for no reason. I expect more from people on a sub dedicated to science.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It appears to be a causal factor</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Reducing LDL will reduce the amount of LDL capable of being oxidized. There is no reason to not keep cholesterol levels as low as possible.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I really like that saying about smoking: those who didnt get cancer from smoking just died of a heart attack. Quiting smoking majorly decreases the risk of cancer. Lowering LDL - very questionable to have a big impact for lower CVD risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Well, some people are made like this from the start. When I dropped the carbs from my diet, which was killing me, my LDL went sky high. I still avoid processed foods, take a few more carbs in a form of fruit, but eat more fat and protein anyway, and my LDL is higher than it was, when I was overweight and on a way to T2D. So I literrally dont have a big choice, the composition how I eat now makes me healthier and feel better objectively, but my LDL went up, eventhough my TG went down and HDL went up. Should I go vegan just because we have overwhelming amount of studies directed to prove that LDL will kill me, while nobody really researched that risk in context which I am facing? Well I am really willing to take that risk. Its not really a matter of choice. Is it possible, that I can search for some kind of magic composition of diet to maximally lower my LDL and keeping my health? Well, maybe, but It may take 10 years. Am I saying people should increase their LDL on purpose? No. I am saying that if other health markers improve, increased LDL shouldnt be the boogieman which keeps you from changing your lifestyle.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I should be more clear. Why The myopic focus on ldl-c when remanat cholesterol has greater predictive power?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Less cars on the road reduces the chance of auto accidents, but more cars isn&#39;t necessarily the cause of auto accidents. Large amounts of cars can travel large distances with zero auto accidents. </p>

<p>In a discussion of whether high levels of LDL in low carbohydrate diets is harmful or not that&#39;s an important distinction</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Lowering LDL - very questionable to have a big impact for lower CVD risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is contextual. Lowering LDL-c when you hit your 50&#39;s and the damage is already done? Not likely to make a huge difference. Keeping your LDL-c low your whole life? Likely to make a huge difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I can get behind what you say. Most likely you are at much lower risk right now if you improved many other risks factor while still keeping high or having higher LDL. Nobody can say actually say how all of those factors interplay togheter and which profile gives the least amount of risk for a given individual. But base on what we know, would it be even better if you improved everything, including LDL? I&#39;d say the odd favor a yes, but again, nobody can actually say for sure.  </p>

<p>What I don&#39;t agree with is people trying to discredit the lipid hypothesis as if LDL-c had no role whatsoever to play in the disease and that tell people who experience elevated LDL-c on a ketogenic diet to not care about it cause it does not matter. Some people even go as far as saying that high LDL-c is healthy because of some observational studies with very questionnable causality that found increase in some diseases (cancer, depression, suicide) or mortality in old age (the very same people who usually discredit observational studies as junk science), while downplaying drug trials, prospective cohort studies, mendelian studies, animal studies, mechanistical studies who all consistenly show that LDL-c matter. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you found a diet that works for you and that you feel is making you healthier!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Why the false dichotomy? Why should we choose between high trig or high LDL? Why not keep both low?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Have there been any successful interventions where lowering remnant cholesterol reversed atherosclerosis? How do you only lower remnant cholesterol? Since all cholesterols are atherogenic why not lower them all?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Because you post here often with an almost singular focus on LDL as the cause of atherosclerosis, and a disregard for other variables.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think many argue LDL or other lipoproteins are unimportant, but they don&#39;t fully seem to acount for CVD risk. </p>

<p>Athrogenic activity of LDL seems to rely on oxidative status, and possibly heparan sulfate levels. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24333941/">Potential roles of vessel wall heparan sulfate proteoglycans in atherosclerosis.</a></p>

<p>HDL seems to be Athrogenic only under certain conditions, and anto-athrogenic under others. So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to cast all lipoproteins as Athrogenic. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/21304474">HDL and cardiovascular disease: atherogenic and atheroprotective mechanisms.</a>/</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if there have been any interventional trials successful or not on remanat cholesterol. 
The lack of successful statin clinical trials following rule changes requiring pre-registration likely points to at least some level of publication bias in the lipid hypothesis and casts doubt on statins effectiveness. </p>

Additional effects were reductions in blood pressure, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and white blood cell count (all P < 1 × 10-7) while cIMT was unchanged. The 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score decreased - 11.9% (P = 4.9 × 10-5). Antihypertensive medication use was discontinued in 11.4% of CCI participants (P = 5.3 × 10-5).

                  'Results\n'
                  'Using microarray analysis we found in FH patients a '
                  'significant up-regulation of 1,617 genes and a '
                  'down-regulation of 701 genes compared to monocytes from '
                  'healthy individuals. These include genes of proteins that '
                  'are involved in the uptake, biosynthesis, disposition, and '
                  'cellular efflux of cholesterol. In addition, plasma from FH '
                  'patients contains elevated amounts of sterols and '
                  'oxysterols. An increased uptake of oxidized as well as of '
                  'native LDL by FH monocytes combined with a down-regulation '
                  'of NPC1 and ABCA1 explains the lipid accumulation observed '

                  'Conclusion\n'
                  'Our data demonstrate that circulating FH monocytes show '
                  'differences in cell physiology that may contribute to the '

The aim of the current study was to describe quality of life in patients with stable coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction and heart failure and to evaluate the relationship between depression and health-related quality of life.\n\nMaterial and methods\nPatients after STEMI, with stable coronary artery disease, and heart failure (n = 332) completed the MacNew Heart Disease Health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n\nResults\nPatients with myocardial infarction had significantly higher scores than patients with stable coronary artery disease or heart failure on the MacNew global scale (p < 0.001) and the physical (p < 0.001), emotional (p < 0.001) and social (p < 0.001) subscales. The anxiety scores were significantly higher in the group of patients with stable coronary artery disease than in patients with myocardial infarction (p < 0.05). The depression scores were significantly higher in patients with heart failure (p < 0.01).\n\nConclusions\nIn patients with stable CAD, anxiety correlated mainly with symptoms, i.e. angina, than with the history of MI. Patients with symptoms of angina react to the illness with anxiety more than depression, whereas patients with heart failure with dyspnea react to the illness with depressive symptoms more than anxiety. In patients after MI and with stable CAD, cognitive-behavioral techniques could be useful to quickly reduce the level of anxiety, while patients with heart failure require long-term support therapy to reduce the risk of depressive symptoms.","DOI":"10.5114/aoms.2014.47881","extra":"PMID: 27186176\nPMCID: PMC4848348","title":"Quality of life in patients with coronary heart disease after myocardial infarction and with ischemic heart failure","volume":"12","issue":"2","pages":"326-333","date":"2016-4-01","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848348/","libraryCatalog":"PubMed Central","accessDate":"2019-07-02T20:35:58Z"}]

                  'treatments are indicated for several reasons such as '
                  'improvement of physical functioning, pain relief, to '
                  'estimate the effectiveness of therapies or to predict '
                  'mortality. The aim of the current study was to describe '
                  'quality of life in patients with stable coronary artery '
                  'disease, myocardial infarction and heart failure and to '
                  'evaluate the relationship between depression and '
                  'health-related quality of life.\n'
                  '\n'
                  'Material and methods\n'
                  'Patients after STEMI, with stable coronary artery disease, '
                  'and heart failure (n = 332) completed the MacNew Heart '
                  'Disease Health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire and '
                  'the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n'
                  '\n'
                  'Results\n'
                  'Patients with myocardial infarction had significantly '
                  'higher scores than patients with stable coronary artery '
                  'disease or heart failure on the MacNew global scale (p < '
                  '0.001) and the physical (p < 0.001), emotional (p < 0.001) '
                  'and social (p < 0.001) subscales. The anxiety scores were '
                  'significantly higher in the group of patients with stable '
                  'coronary artery disease than in patients with myocardial '
                  'infarction (p < 0.05). The depression scores were '
                  'significantly higher in patients with heart failure (p < '
                  '0.01).\n'
                  '\n'
                  'Conclusions\n'
                  'In patients with stable CAD, anxiety correlated mainly with '
                  'symptoms, i.e. angina, than with the history of MI. '
                  'Patients with symptoms of angina react to the illness with '
                  'anxiety more than depression, whereas patients with heart '
                  'failure with dyspnea react to the illness with depressive '
                  'symptoms more than anxiety. In patients after MI and with '
                  'stable CAD, cognitive-behavioral techniques could be useful '
                  'to quickly reduce the level of anxiety, while patients with '
                  'heart failure require long-term support therapy to reduce '
                  'the risk of depressive symptoms.',

Preventive treatment that reduces CVD by even a small percentage can substantially reduce, nationally and globally, the number of people who develop CVD and the costs of caring for them. This American Heart Association presidential advisory on dietary fats and CVD reviews and discusses the scientific evidence, including the most recent studies, on the effects of dietary saturated fat intake and its replacement by other types of fats and carbohydrates on CVD. In summary, randomized controlled trials that lowered intake of dietary saturated fat and replaced it with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced CVD by ≈30%, similar to the reduction achieved by statin treatment. Prospective observational studies in many populations showed that lower intake of saturated fat coupled with higher intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat is associated with lower rates of CVD and of other major causes of death and all-cause mortality. In contrast, replacement of saturated fat with mostly refined carbohydrates and sugars is not associated with lower rates of CVD and did not reduce CVD in clinical trials. Replacement of saturated with unsaturated fats lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a cause of atherosclerosis, linking biological evidence with incidence of CVD in populations and in clinical trials.

  'abstractNote': 'Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading global cause of '
                  'death, accounting for 17.3 million deaths per year. '
                  'Preventive treatment that reduces CVD by even a small '
                  'percentage can substantially reduce, nationally and '
                  'globally, the number of people who develop CVD and the '
                  'costs of caring for them. This American Heart Association '
                  'presidential advisory on dietary fats and CVD reviews and '
                  'discusses the scientific evidence, including the most '
                  'recent studies, on the effects of dietary saturated fat '
                  'intake and its replacement by other types of fats and '
                  'carbohydrates on CVD. In summary, randomized controlled '
                  'trials that lowered intake of dietary saturated fat and '
                  'replaced it with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced CVD '
                  'by ≈30%, similar to the reduction achieved by statin '
                  'treatment. Prospective observational studies in many '
                  'populations showed that lower intake of saturated fat '
                  'coupled with higher intake of polyunsaturated and '
                  'monounsaturated fat is associated with lower rates of CVD '
                  'and of other major causes of death and all-cause mortality. '
                  'In contrast, replacement of saturated fat with mostly '
                  'refined carbohydrates and sugars is not associated with '
                  'lower rates of CVD and did not reduce CVD in clinical '
                  'trials. Replacement of saturated with unsaturated fats '
                  'lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a cause of '
                  'atherosclerosis, linking biological evidence with incidence '
                  'of CVD in populations and in clinical trials. Taking into '
                  'consideration the totality of the scientific evidence, '
                  'satisfying rigorous criteria for causality, we conclude '

"
<div class="md"><p>While I&#39;m not saying this invalides the conclusions, I think this study had a potentially large analytical flaw in that they used BMI instead of body fat percentage.  Normally the &#39;BMI sucks&#39; argument doesn&#39;t have very strong validity but I think in this specific case it might be a cogent argument.  Army personnel are much more likely to have above-average muscle mass compared to the (largely sedentary) civilian population and increased muscle mass will inflate the overall BMI averages more in the Army sample than the civilian sample.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Anyone know what the dietary differences are between US army personnel and civilians? I would imagine the SAD is as bad as it gets (maybe after the new Indian diet).</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I have asked this before, but does anyone else think that stress (more than diet) could be the key factor determining cardiovascular health? After all, being in the army is not exactly a delightful experience.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not aware of single study that controlled for distress (as opposed to eustress).</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point. Even passing basic training and physical training would stimulate more muscle growth than the average sedentary person has.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yup, people complain constantly about military BMI measures for that exact reason. I mean, many of the men and women in the military are overweight, but the muscle bound guys/gals are above average built, and a couple of times a year they have to jump through bureaucratic hoops to prove they are not in fact overweight.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Oh for craps sake, how big a difference could it be? A pound or maybe two?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Could be many things, but military members (Marine Corps, here) eat a lot of fast food. It&#39;s an unwritten rule to avoid the chow hall as much as possible, and with a dozen fast food places on each base, and kids having disposable income for the first time, guess where everyone eats. The chow hall isn&#39;t much healthier though. It&#39;s all canned food, fried food and low quality meats, and buffet style serving of sugary drinks, dessert bars, baked potato bars with fake cheese and bacon, and so on.</p>

<p>Also, everyone is young. Most of the men and women are coming from 18 years of eating what their parents put in front of them, and then suddenly they get to make their own dietary choices. Some of us have never seen so much food before!</p>

<p>On top of that there&#39;s heavy tobacco use, heavy drinking, punishing exercise, and weeks eating MREs which are basically dog food for humans.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Sleep deprivation is also common in the military and that is <a href="https://peterattiamd.com/matthewwalker1/">terrible for all kinds of health factors</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Wow, I had a totally different view of what armed forces ate. You would think that a greater effort to remove junk food would be made.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What&#39;s crazy about the whole situation is the military is the one sector in life where authorities have 100% control over everything. If commanders didn&#39;t want personnel eating junk food, or smoking, or even drinking, they could make that happen and there&#39;s nothing anyone can say or do about it. Yet the commanders don&#39;t. I don&#39;t know why. Troop morale? Kickbacks from the fast food industry? Could be any number of things.</p>

<p>Either way, the military has an obesity problem on its hands. I was chubby in The Marine Corps. Always bumping up against the upper limits of regulations. (I&#39;m in better shape now than I was then.) I remember at one morning formation, looking around and being surprised at the high number of &quot;beer bellies&quot; I saw.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The military is actually one of the things that Nina Teicholz used as an example of why our dietary guidelines suck.  She was talking about how the military uses the dietary guidelines in deciding what they eat and yet there is an obesity problem there.  I&#39;ve been upset at our guidelines for awhile, but their effect on the military is something I hadn&#39;t considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The number who actually adhere to the dietary guidelines, in service or not, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p1116-fruit-vegetable-consumption.html">is small</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I could get behind her message if not for the fast food. One time I was standing in line at the chow hall and one of the exasperated cooks yelled at everyone, &quot;Yo! It&#39;s the 15th. We just got paid. What are you doing here?!&quot; Because really, everyone avoids eating the government food when they can. Even the cooks don&#39;t want you to be there.</p>

<p>The military might be proof that no one is following the guidelines.</p>

<p>Some of my friends in the service were in amazing shape, and I sat with them to eat from time to time. What they had on their plate was very different from mine. Rice, veggies, lean meat, lots of fruit, no fried stuff, no desserts. Probably not too far off from official guidelines. The &quot;classic&quot; idea of a healthy diet.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s really interesting.  The funny thing is, the podcast I mentioned is more focused on low-carb/keto eating, so they likely wouldn&#39;t agree with what your in-shape friends were eating.  To me though, the thing that sticks out is their diet is at least avoiding ultra-processed, veg oils, refined carbs/grains, and low sugar so in that aspect I think most people should be able to agree it&#39;s much better than most things out there.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Oh sure, they also skipped the sandwiches and subs and other foods which are just stomach filling carbs without much nutrition.</p>

<p>On a related note, these days, when I have dinner with my obese friend at his house, when the food hits the table out comes the bbq sauce, ranch, mayo, horseradish sauce, etc. A whole bunch of extra processed crap full of sugar and veg oils that ruins what might have otherwise been a healthy meal.</p>

2019-07-02 15:37:21,493 - __main__ - DEBUG - Submission Full Text: 
"
<div class="md"><p>Conceptually makes sense... the brain will still function with ketone bodies supplying energy instead of glucose; however, the tumor should stop growing considering ketogenic diet will inhibit anabolic pathways. </p>

<p>Not exactly a cure, but an avenue worth more research-- especially interesting in combination with drug trials.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>: Prognosis for patients with high-grade brain tumor is poor and survival did neither substantially change with advances in chemotherapy, radiotherapy and molecular profiling. Ketogenic diets have been suggested as a promising alternative therapy. However, group studies in cancer patients with the classical ketogenic diet so far provided little or no evidence that the classical ketogenic diet is indeed beneficial in terms of prolonging survival.  </p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>: Here we present three cases: one patient with grade 3 brain tumor, (pat #1: anaplastic oligodendroglioma) and two patients with grade 4 brain tumor (pat #2: recurrent glioblastoma; pat #3: new-onset glioblastoma). The three patients were started on the strickest form of the paleolithic ketogenic diet (PKD): the full meat-fat diet. At the time of diet onset all three patients refused chemotherapy and radiotherapy and did neither use any dietary supplements nor standard medications. They all strictly adhered to the diet and were in constant ketosis. Pat #1, who was overweight at diet onset, lost 25 kg on the diet during the first nine months of the diet. During this time tumor size was relatively stable. Later on tumor size gradually increased which was preceded by a gradual increase in food intake without affecting ketosis. Along with this inflammatory parameters increased as well. The patient was advised to decrease food intake and subsequently inflammatory parameters decreased again. In pat #2, in addition to recurrent glioblastoma, past history also included bladder cancer. Despite surgery and radiochemotherapy his brain tumor recurred. Upon recurrence, the patient stopped radiochemotherapy and started the PKD as a stand-alone therapy. Currently, the patient is on the diet for 14 months and is progression-free. Pat #3 had a stable tumor size for the first two months of the diet when he used the diet as a stand-alone therapy. Then, despite being progression-free and having no sympoms at all, the patient decided to have radiotherapy. Although we advised against, he also started taking multiple supplements and began hyperbaric oxigen therapy. From this time on his disease progressed and the patient died at 11 months. Conclusions: The two patients using the PKD as a stand-alone therapy are still alive at 25 and 14 months while the third patient after starting additional therapies experienced progression and died.</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>Well.. it is for sure irresponsible to state that additional therapies accelarated the death of the 3rd patient. All cancers are different, parallel diseases are different, state of overall health of the patient  is different. There are too many variables to conclude anything like this from a case study. 
I am really pro keto, I have been using it for quite a while. I am also thrilled about the potential, but to this day, keto is not approved as a stand alone therapy and its very risk to apply it single handedly. 3 case studies are not science. We should be cautious about this kind of information. Use keto as an adjunct, but also trust the traditional medicine, cause cancer is no joke.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Not sure what they&#39;re concluding here. The conclusion reads more like an observation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conclusions: The two patients using the PKD as a stand-alone therapy are still alive at 25 and 14 months while the third patient after starting additional therapies experienced progression and died.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is the implied conclusion that the diet is saving these two patients, while the third patient died because they started additional therapies in addition to being on the diet? Seems like a <em>huge</em> reach.</p>

<p>It also mentions they advised against additional therapies for one of the patients. This sounds incredibly irresponsible. Lifestyle interventions for cancer should be used in addition to proven cancer treatment. Why would they advise a cancer patient to avoid something like radiotherapy in place of an experimental diet?</p>

<p>Also note that the three authors have stake in <a href="https://www.paleomedicina.com/en">paleomedicina</a>. All factors considered, these three cases don&#39;t seem to show much and to me feel like a marketing attempt for their business masked as &quot;science.&quot; Come on. We&#39;re barely scratching the surface with ketogenic/low-carb diets, and now they&#39;re suggesting their &quot;paleo keto diet&quot;? I guess it makes sense from a business perspective.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Well.. it is for sure irresponsible to state that additional therapies accelarated the death of the 3rd patient.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They did not. Here&#39;s the actual conclusion from the PDF</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUSIONS: The two patients (pat#1 and pat#2) that have been using the PKD as a stand-alone therapy are still alive at 25 and 14 months after diet onset. Pat#2, who had the worst initial outlook (recurrent glioblastoma and a past history of bladder cancer), but well-controlled the amount of food, is progression-free and symptom-free for 14 months. Pat#3 was also progression-free and symptom-free so far the diet was used as a stand-alone therapy. <strong>After receiving radiotherapy, steroid and other ”alternative” treatments his condition progressed</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a case study of three patients. How else would you have them phrase the fact that the third person&#39;s condition progressed <em>after</em> receiving these treatments (they never implied causality; and they used the word &quot;associated&quot; elsewhere)? Would you like them to suppress this fact, and not report it at all?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p><a href="https://peterattiamd.com/tomseyfried/">https://peterattiamd.com/tomseyfried/</a></p>

<p>From above podcast. If i remember correctly standard treatment for some brain tumors don&#39;t actually improve survival time... And for said brain tumors basically everyone dies in pretty quick time yet we currently have a few people who have managed their brain tumor with strict ketogenic diet who have survived for many more years than what is typical. in the abscence of ketogenic diet this doesnt happen....</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I mean they are charging the standard doctor consultation fees. Would you ignore your doctor&#39;s advice because he is charging you fees based on a business perspective?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>After receiving radiotherapy, steroid and other ”alternative” treatments his condition progressed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This line states that the disease progressed when the patient received additional treatment than KD alone. So how would you describe, what they have said here?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Gotcha. I&#39;m aware keto diets have shown some promise for certain kinds of cancers. My criticism isn&#39;t about that, but more about the impression I got from this paper.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Seems like they&#39;re pushing a brand. It certainly doesn&#39;t feel like your average physicians website. Couple that with their &quot;implied conclusion&quot; that the &quot;paleo&quot; KD works while a classic KD doesn&#39;t. It doesn&#39;t strike me as completely genuine, but that&#39;s just my opinion.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p><em>After receiving radiotherapy, steroid and other ”alternative” treatments his condition progressed</em>  </p>

<p>This line states that the disease progressed when the patient received additional treatment than KD alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct. They reported what they observed. My question to you is: why is this irresponsible of them to report? Had they suggested that this was the <em>cause</em> I&#39;d see your point.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>She is promoting Paleolithic Ketogenic diet because it works for her patients. Would you like her to stop doing that and inhibit herself from publishing her results to the scientific community? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s more context into her work <a href="https://youtu.be/nDPM8o9jcFA">https://youtu.be/nDPM8o9jcFA</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>An average person can for sure imply causation on such a finding. That the person got sicker because of the additional treatment. We dont really know the context, why this person tried alternative treatments, perhaps his situation was quite different? Thats why I dont like the conclusions.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I would&#39;ve liked them to conclude with something more genuine, like &quot;These case studies show promise for PKD but it&#39;s premature to make any conclusions and more research is needed.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m also sure she&#39;s dealt with that worsened on the PKD. Does she publish these as well or does she simply batch publish positive case studies?</p>

<p>The fact that they simply re-stated the results as the conclusion seems misleading, and doesn&#39;t strike me an honest oversight. Specially after considering the background of all involved. I&#39;ve no issues with her publishing anything or helping anyone. It&#39;s the delivery that has me wondering.</p>

                  'been suggested as a promising alternative therapy. However, '
                  'group studies in cancer patients with the classical '
                  'ketogenic diet so far provided little or no evidence that '
                  'the classical ketogenic diet is indeed beneficial in terms '
                  'of prolonging survival.\n'
                  'Results: Here we present three cases: one patient with '
                  'grade 3 brain tumor, (pat #1: anaplastic oligodendroglioma) '
                  'and two patients with grade 4 brain tumor (pat #2: '
                  'recurrent glioblastoma; pat #3: new-onset glioblastoma). '
                  'The three patients were started on the strickest form of '
                  'the paleolithic ketogenic diet (PKD): the full meat-fat '
                  'diet. At the time of diet onset all three patients refused '
                  'chemotherapy and radiotherapy and did neither use any '
                  'dietary supplements nor standard medications. They all '
                  'strictly adhered to the diet and were in constant ketosis. '
                  'Pat #1, who was overweight at diet onset, lost 25 kg on the '
                  'diet during the first nine months of the diet. During this '
                  'time tumor size was relatively stable. Later on tumor size '
                  'gradually increased which was preceded by a gradual '
                  'increase in food intake without affecting ketosis. Along '
                  'with this inflammatory parameters increased as well. The '
                  'patient was advised to decrease food intake and '
                  'subsequently inflammatory parameters decreased again. In '
                  'pat #2, in addition to recurrent glioblastoma, past history '
                  'also included bladder cancer. Despite surgery and '
                  'radiochemotherapy his brain tumor recurred. Upon '
                  'recurrence, the patient stopped radiochemotherapy and '
                  'started the PKD as a stand-alone therapy. Currently, the '
                  'patient is on the diet for 14 months and is '
                  'progression-free. Pat #3 had a stable tumor size for the '
                  'first two months of the diet when he used the diet as a '
                  'stand-alone therapy. Then, despite being progression-free '
                  'and having no sympoms at all, the patient decided to have '
                  'radiotherapy. Although we advised against, he also started '
                  'taking multiple supplements and began hyperbaric oxigen '
                  'therapy. From this time on his disease progressed and the '
                  'patient died at 11 months.\n'
                  'Conclusions: The two patients using the PKD as a '
                  'stand-alone therapy are still alive at 25 and 14 months '
                  'while the third patient after starting additional therapies '
                  'experienced progression and died.',

2019-07-02 15:37:27,150 - __main__ - DEBUG - Submission Full Text: 
"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Homogenization is an interesting topic in nutrition. From what I&#39;ve gathered, it&#39;s not uncommon for people to fail to satisfy all their optimal nutritional health needs, and that a good means to attempt to satisfy their nutritional needs is to consume a diet diverse in foods.</p>

<p>It also seems that food groups such as meat and eggs provide quite a differing quantity of nutritional benefits, compared to what can be found in other food groups.</p>

<p>If these things are true, then can one reason, ethical considerations aside, that the best thing a vegan could do for their nutritional health, would be to consume something like an egg, or meat?</p>

<p>If this is to be true, then what might the benefits a vegan find, if they were to consume some sort of animal product on a monthly basis?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gathered that, sea meats tend to be healthier for us than land meats, mostly because the fatty oils in seafood tends to benefit us more so than fatty land oils (which includes things like vegetable oil). Some vegans don&#39;t appear to have a moral objection to consuming oysters, so to these vegans, might it be wise for them to consume oysters, to get the health benefits of eating meat from a sea creature?</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>If you are vegan, you can get the benefits of dietary diversity by eating a diversity of plant foods. Don’t exclude any of the plant based food groups (grains, nuts) unnecessarily. Don’t eat a lot of nutrient-poor refined foods that make it more difficult to get necessary nutrients from your daily intake. Yes, certain animal products can be a sort of “insurance” against deficiencies because we are animals and our cells require the same molecules as other animals’ cells. Oysters contain a lot of zinc and vitamin B12, which is a good contribution to a healthy diet, but a wise vegan can get similar benefits from incorporating pumpkin seeds and hemp seeds plus a B12 supplement. </p>

<p>The “best thing a vegan could do for their nutritional health” is keep an eye on their nutrient intake and become educated about what plant foods are good contributors of certain nutrients, or supplementing where that is a more realistic option. No animal products necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It depends on the individual diet. If the diet has a high omega 6 to 3 ratio it would be probably healthy to include EPA and DHA in the diet, for example fish or oysters (or algae oil which is fine as well, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17713804">study</a>). If the diets lacks iron than red meat could be used to treat this iron deficiency (similar effects can IMO be achived by increasing iron intake from plant sources).</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I have no reason to believe that a well-planned vegan diet gets healthier if you add animal products.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Why would ethical considerations be aside? Isn&#39;t ethics the core of veganism?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I see your line of thinking. Adding an egg here and there sounds like a good insurance policy against getting dangerously on certain nutrients that aren&#39;t found in high quantities in plants. However the amount of animal product you would need to actually make a difference in your levels of those nutrients is probably about the same as when you start seeing those negative health benefits appear. I like the idea of consuming things like clams and oysters though. Especially since they are among the lowest in Mercury.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>&gt;I&#39;ve gathered that, sea meats tend to be healthier for us than land meats</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Um, no, I don&#39;t think that has been shown to be true.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks mate. Do you know how would one go about creating a well-planned vegan diet, that has enough variation that homogenization doesn&#39;t end up causing it to be ineffective with time?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Because I wish to talk about nutrition and not ethics.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Its due to omega 3 and 6 balancing.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Try to avoid getting a lot of calories from highly processed foods, especially foods high in calories without many nutrients like oil, sugar refined flour...</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Check out the &quot;daily dozen&quot; app if you check all the boxes in the app you are pretty safe from nutrient deficiencies. A diet high in legumes, green leafy, vegetables and high in omega 3 is the way to go IMO and encouraged by the app aswell.  </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Supplements: </p>

<p>-Take your B12 (non-negotiable)</p>

<p>- depending on where you live and how much sun you get Vitamin D should be supplemented durin winter</p>

<p>-DHA (Micro algae oil): The science is unclear on that one Imo. If you have a low omega 6 to 3 ratio you may convert enough ALA omega 3 to EPA and DHA (EPA is not that much of a problem), but if you want to enjoy your high omega 6 (peanuts, cashews, almonds, sunflowerseeds ...) foods without having to worry and just play it safe, I would recommend taking it.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>If you start to get into routine (most people do) and you know what your typical day of eating looks like put it in cronometer and check if you get everything you need.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>These recommendations are pretty conservative. There are a lot of vegans who dont pay this much attention to their diet and are fine, but I think it is your health on the line so better be safe than sorry.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Then you mean plant-based, there’s nothing healthy about avoiding leather or fur, which is also veganism.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Also the fact that when eating fish people tend to eat more of the body, sometimes even the bones. Whereas land meat it&#39;s almost always merely the muscle. There are all kinds of healthy nutrients in the ligaments, cartilage, bones, and other such things, which is usually ignored in land meat.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Take your B12 (non-negotiable)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can get this from fortified foods like nutritional yeast or soy milk as well</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>huh, good point, thank you for clarifying this for me.</p>
</div>"

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I would like to understand more about antioxidants, whether they really are helping us with health in terms of resisting cancer, making us live longer, etc. or something about the theory that free radicals are to blame for a lot of health problems, etc. Something in depth . Or even scientific studies. Sorry if this is a broad question.</p>

<p>Edit: From a quick google search I couldn’t really find much,</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>Those theories died over a decade ago, when antioxidant trials in humans and animals lead to worse outcomes.</p>

<p>This is may be the most cited paper (353 times) on antioxidants in the past 5 years. When I first read it, it summed up my conclusions when I attempted to answer questions like yours for myself.</p>

<p>Forman et al, 2014. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3852196/">How do nutritional antioxidants really work: nucleophilic tone and para-hormesis versus free radical scavenging in vivo</a>. <em>Free Radical Biology and Medicine</em>, <em>66</em>, pp.24-35.</p>

<p>Some simple truths:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some inflammatory cascades cause uncontrolled damage from reactive oxygen species. Things that may seem unrelated, like ischemia-reperfusion injury after heart attacks/strokes, have endogenous inflammatory ROS generation as their effective mechanism.</li>
<li>normally, ROS are vital to cell signalling</li>
<li><strong>exo</strong>genous antioxidants can interfere with cell signalling</li>
<li>organisms have dealt with reactive oxygen species for over two billion years, and have finely regulated <strong>endo</strong>genous antioxidant responses</li>
<li>exogenous antioxidants also have prooxidant activity, from either redox cycling or catalytic activity. When bodybuilders OD on green tea extract, their livers die because EGCG at high doses is a redox cycler, depleting endogenous antioxidants like reduced glutathione</li>
<li>exogenous anti/pro-oxidants appear to have benefit through inducing regulated endogenous antioxidant response.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to delve, I have some assemblages on <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-2XWDkPfB2Oc050cVJWeVF5cHc">antioxidants</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-2XWDkPfB2OcWFTMndaLUVsR0E">oxidative stress</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-2XWDkPfB2OMzd2dXhBNkpRa2c">Nrf2 hormesis</a>, though it seems I haven&#39;t scoured the literature for a few years.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Try to look for these keywords:
- Biochemistry of oxidative stress
- Physiology
- Oxidative dna damage
- Oxygen toxicity
- Oxidants and antioxidants
- Free radicals scavengers
- Vitamins role
- Glutathione peroxidase, catalase
- Superoxide dismutase
- Books/articles about inflammation, cancer and neurological disorders</p>

<p>During the bachelor&#39;s environmental biochem coursework we didn&#39;t have a book, but I was able to find many resources from us universities</p>

<p>Try also to have a look at some Bioinorganic books indexes. Most of these books cover oxidative stress which is related to metabolism and metals homeostasis/regulation. </p>

<p>These seem good:</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Abstract
CHC22 clathrin plays a key role in intracellular membrane traffic of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 in humans. We performed population genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the CHC22-encoding CLTCL1 gene, revealing independent gene loss in at least two vertebrate lineages, after arising from gene duplication. All vertebrates retained the paralogous CLTC gene encoding CHC17 clathrin, which mediates endocytosis. For vertebrates retaining CLTCL1, strong evidence for purifying selection supports CHC22 functionality. All human populations maintained two high frequency CLTCL1 allelic variants, encoding either methionine or valine at position 1316. Functional studies indicated that CHC22-V1316, which is more frequent in farming populations than in hunter-gatherers, has different cellular dynamics than M1316-CHC22 and is less effective at controlling GLUT4 membrane traffic, altering its insulin-regulated response. These analyses suggest that ancestral human dietary change influenced selection of allotypes that affect CHC22’s role in metabolism and have potential to differentially influence the human insulin response.</p>

<p>&quot;... a dietary metabolite linked to red meat called trimethylamine N-oxide, or TMAO. Three recent meta-analyses confirmed that high blood levels of TMAO are associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. One of the studies, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association in 2017, found a more than 60% heightened risk of both major adverse cardiovascular events and death from all causes in people with elevated TMAO. Other research has associated higher TMAO levels with heart failure and chronic kidney disease.&quot;</p>

<p>This recent study using mandelian randomization found reverse causality with CVD/diabetes resulting in an increase of TMAO levels, not the other way around. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract
We examined the causal direction between gut microbiota-dependent metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) or its predecessors and cardiometabolic diseases such as risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We used genetic variants as instruments to test the causal associations. Genetically predicted higher TMAO and carnitine were not associated with higher odds of T2DM, AF, CAD, MI, stroke, and CKD after Bonferroni correction (P≤0.0005). However, we observed that genetically increased choline showed a suggestive association with higher risk of T2DM (odds ratio: 1.84, 95% confidence interval: 1.00 to 3.42 per 10 units, P=0.05). In contrast, genetically predicted higher betaine (0.68, 0.48 to 0.95 per 10 units, P=0.023) was suggestively associated with a lower risk of T2DM. We observed a suggestive association of genetically increased choline with a lower level of body fat % (beta: -0.28, SE: 0.11, P=0.013), but a higher level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (0.10±0.05, P=0.034). We further found that T2DM (beta: 0.130, SE: 0. 0.036, P&lt;0.0001) and CKD (0.483±0.168, P=0.004) were causally associated with higher TMAO levels. Our MR findings support that T2DM and kidney disease increase TMAO levels and observational evidence for cardiovascular diseases may be due to confounding or reverse causality.</p>

<p>My personal belief is the red meat/mortality connection is the byproduct of the healthy user bias. I&#39;ll be interested if the reverse causality of TMAO and CVD/diabetes is confirmed through replication of this study, or other supporting data, and what other alternatives will be presented to explain the red meat connection.</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>I never bought the TMAO/CVD story, as fish consumers would be exposed to orders of magnitude more TMA than red meat consumers via carnitine. It seems likely to me that high TMAO status is a coincident marker of diets (and resultant microbiome composition) that are harmful by other mechanisms.</p>

<p>The apparent choline / betaine causal associations with T2DM is supported by past observational metabolomics. Beets and spinach over eggs.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Most fish have very little TMAO. It’s only deep sea fish that have it in any significant amounts. </p>

<p>The TMA content of all fish is not significant.</p>

<p>No thanks, I&#39;d rather exchange the high oxalic acid, Purines (Gout) with shrimps (EPA+DHA) which also has high amounts of betaine.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been reading many meta-studies, listening to Peter Attia podcasts, Sinclair and the like. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Still I haven&#39;t understood what is currently considered the most effective anti-cancer diet for preventing cancer. In principle keto diets starve cancers due to lack of glucose but still I have read about studies finding more cancer in keto subjects maybe because of too much meat. Also vegetarian diets have seemingly lower cancer rates.</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>Fasting and eating whole plants and unprocessed meat. Pretty simple. While also avoiding smoking and radiation and such, obviously.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>If you want consensus, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find that. Each camp will generally claim its own way to be the best for everything.</p>

<p>That being said, here are some dietary variables that seem to affect cancer:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Omega-6 fat promotes cancer:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3921234">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3921234</a></p>

<p>Stearic acid inhibits cancer:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19267249">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19267249</a></p>

<p>Methionine promotes cancer:</p>

<p><a href="http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/64/7_Supplement/903.4.short">http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/64/7_Supplement/903.4.short</a></p>

<p>Tryptophan promotes cancer:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/421204">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/421204</a></p>

<p>Glycine inhibits cancer:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10545408">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10545408</a></p>

<p>Iron promotes cancer:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1657354">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1657354</a></p>

<p>Finally, people like to say &quot;sugar feeds cancer,&quot; but orange juice, though sugary, can inhibit cancer:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8875554">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8875554</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Can you please share the studies regarding more cancers in keto subjects?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I think the best diet for avoiding cancer is one that avoids hyperinsulinemia; the diet to achieve that may differ from person to person. I also think that a diet that promotes autophagy is likely a good idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Add in a regular strength training regiment to this lifestyle and one is good to go.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Though if an x-ray or CT-scan is indicated by your physician, you shouldn&#39;t avoid it out of radiation fears.</p>

<p>We have yet to conclusively prove that dosages below around 100 mSv cause cancer. For reference, a chest x-ray delivers about 0.1 mSv and an abdominal CT-scan can deliver around 10 mSv.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Source?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Relevant: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/buuzw5/is_everything_we_eat_associated_with_cancer_a/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/buuzw5/is_everything_we_eat_associated_with_cancer_a/</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>trying to find it but it&#39;s not on pubmed. it was a comparison between different diets. i read it on my google news...</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Indeed. As well as limiting your mental stress. Relax!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I mean high dose radiation. Getting an x-ray with one of those lead vests is most likely fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>For meat, see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/btzkzg/what_is_the_role_of_meat_in_a_healthy_diet/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/btzkzg/what_is_the_role_of_meat_in_a_healthy_diet/</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It looked like that examined observational evidence, right? What I cited was all experimental.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Let’s throw in proper hydration and sleep as well!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Sleep absolutely, forgot about that. I find dry fasting to be very nice and strengthening, but you should still properly rehydrate afterwards so proper hydration still applies. For instance I just got back from an hour in the sauna and I haven&#39;t had food or water in about 18 hours. Really cleans you out and feels refreshing. I&#39;ll eat and rehydrate in a few hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Personally, I’d never dry fast. I’m big into drinking tons of water and eating salt while I fast. But my job require standing for 8-10 hours straight and lifting weights during that time - it can be physically demanding. Have to give you props for dry fasting, I’d have a difficult time doing that.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yea you can&#39;t be super active when you do it. Give it a shot on the weekend or whenever you get days off.</p>
</div>"

In this study, we present evidence that exogenously supplied dietary stearate dramatically reduces the size of tumors that formed from injected human breast cancer cells within the mammary fat pads of athymic nude mice by approximately 50% and partially inhibits breast cancer cell metastasis burden in the lungs in this mouse model system. This metastatic inhibition appears to be independent of primary tumor size, as stearate fed animals that had primary tumors comparable in size to littermates fed either a safflower oil enriched diet or a low fat diet had reduced lung metastasis. Also stearate fed mice sub-groups had different primary tumor sizes but no difference in metastasis. This anti-metastasis effect may be due, at least in part, to the ability of stearate to induce apoptosis in these human breast cancer cells.

Since increased cell replication is associated with the development of hepatic cancer caused by peroxisome proliferators, glycine may have anti-cancer properties. Therefore, experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that dietary glycine would inhibit the hepatocarcinogenic effect of WY-14,643. Male F344 rats were fed four different NIH 07-based diets: 5% glycine; 5% valine for nitrogen balance (control); 0.1% WY-14,643 + 5% valine (WY-14,643); 0.1% WY-14,643 + 5% glycine (WY-14,643 + glycine). Food consumption did not differ among the groups, but WY-14,643-fed rats weighed 10-25% less than expected based on previous studies. Serum glycine levels were elevated 4-5-fold by glycine-containing diets; however, the 10-fold increase in peroxisomal enzyme activity caused by WY-14,643 was unaffected by the addition of 5% glycine to the diet. After 22 weeks, livers from rats fed WY-14,643 had a similar incidence and multiplicity of proliferative lesions (foci and adenomas) to those fed WY-14,643 + glycine. Moreover, cell proliferation in the surrounding 'normal' parenchyma (labeling index approximately 4%) and foci (labeling index approximately 50%) did not differ between WY-14,643 and WY-14,643 + glycine-fed rats. However, after 51 weeks of dietary exposure to WY-14,643, glycine prevented formation of small (0-5 mm diameter) tumors by 23% and inhibited the development of medium size (5-10 mm) tumors by 64%. Furthermore, glycine prevented the formation of the largest tumors (>10 mm) by nearly 80%. Thus, glycine did not inhibit early foci formation; however, it significantly decreased their ability to progress to tumors. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of glycine was greater with increasing tumor size. These studies demonstrate that dietary glycine prevents the development of hepatic tumors caused by the peroxisome proliferator WY-14,643 consistent with the idea that it may be an effective chemopreventive agent.","DOI":"10.1093/carcin/20.11.2075","extra":"PMID: 10545408","libraryCatalog":"PubMed"}]

                  'with the development of hepatic cancer caused by peroxisome '
                  'proliferators, glycine may have anti-cancer properties. '
                  'Therefore, experiments were designed to test the hypothesis '
                  'that dietary glycine would inhibit the hepatocarcinogenic '
                  'effect of WY-14,643. Male F344 rats were fed four different '
                  'NIH 07-based diets: 5% glycine; 5% valine for nitrogen '
                  'balance (control); 0.1% WY-14,643 + 5% valine (WY-14,643); '
                  '0.1% WY-14,643 + 5% glycine (WY-14,643 + glycine). Food '
                  'consumption did not differ among the groups, but '
                  'WY-14,643-fed rats weighed 10-25% less than expected based '
                  'on previous studies. Serum glycine levels were elevated '
                  '4-5-fold by glycine-containing diets; however, the 10-fold '
                  'increase in peroxisomal enzyme activity caused by WY-14,643 '
                  'was unaffected by the addition of 5% glycine to the diet. '
                  'After 22 weeks, livers from rats fed WY-14,643 had a '
                  'similar incidence and multiplicity of proliferative lesions '
                  '(foci and adenomas) to those fed WY-14,643 + glycine. '
                  "Moreover, cell proliferation in the surrounding 'normal' "
                  'parenchyma (labeling index approximately 4%) and foci '
                  '(labeling index approximately 50%) did not differ between '
                  'WY-14,643 and WY-14,643 + glycine-fed rats. However, after '
                  '51 weeks of dietary exposure to WY-14,643, glycine '
                  'prevented formation of small (0-5 mm diameter) tumors by '
                  '23% and inhibited the development of medium size (5-10 mm) '
                  'tumors by 64%. Furthermore, glycine prevented the formation '
                  'of the largest tumors (>10 mm) by nearly 80%. Thus, glycine '
                  'did not inhibit early foci formation; however, it '
                  'significantly decreased their ability to progress to '
                  'tumors. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of glycine was '
                  'greater with increasing tumor size. These studies '
                  'demonstrate that dietary glycine prevents the development '
                  'of hepatic tumors caused by the peroxisome proliferator '
                  'WY-14,643 consistent with the idea that it may be an '

<div class="md"><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Studies on long-term sustainability of low-carbohydrate approaches to treat diabetes are limited. We previously reported the effectiveness of a novel digitally-monitored continuous care intervention (CCI) including nutritional ketosis in improving weight, glycemic outcomes, lipid, and liver marker changes at 1 year. Here, we assess the effects of the CCI at 2 years.</p>

<p><strong>Materials and methods</strong>: An open label, non-randomized, controlled study with 262 and 87 participants with T2D were enrolled in the CCI and usual care (UC) groups, respectively. Primary outcomes were retention, glycemic control, and weight changes at 2 years. Secondary outcomes included changes in body composition, liver, cardiovascular, kidney, thyroid and inflammatory markers, diabetes medication use and disease status.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>: Reductions from baseline to 2 years in the CCI group resulting from intent-to-treat analyses included: HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, weight, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and liver alanine transaminase, and HDL-C increased. Spine bone mineral density in the CCI group was unchanged. Use of any glycemic control medication (excluding metformin) among CCI participants declined (from 55.7 to 26.8%) including insulin (-62%) and sulfonylureas (-100%). The UC group had no changes in these parameters (except uric acid and anion gap) or diabetes medication use. There was also resolution of diabetes (reversal, 53.5%; remission, 17.6%) in the CCI group but not in UC. All the reported improvements had p &lt; 0.00012.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The CCI group sustained long-term beneficial effects on multiple clinical markers of diabetes and cardiometabolic health at 2 years while utilizing less medication. The intervention was also effective in the resolution of diabetes and visceral obesity with no adverse effect on bone health.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ketosis is a cure for diabetes, I think nobody can dispute this already.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;d have to qualify the term cure. The benefits last as long as you&#39;re on the diet, and some time after. Going back to old eating patterns reduces the benefits. Hence, a reversible cure</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My husband is a nurse (we both eat keto) and he sees a lot of diabetic patients. He works on a cardiac floor and the hospital policy is that diabetic patients should get &quot;at least&quot; 50 g of carbs per meal while in the hospital. He gets so upset seeing the meals (pancakes with maple syrup, pasta, rice, etc) and they will be pumping the patients full of insulin. </p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t understand how the doctors and other nurses are so blind to this. When he talks about eating keto himself he just gets lectured about how dangerous it is. There was a cardiologist on his floor who decided to eat a super high carb diet to lose weight??? Like what????? These are trained medical professionals in a major city in Canada!</p>

<p>So TL/DR:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ketosis is a cure for diabetes, I think nobody can dispute this already.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, people dispute this all the time, unfortunately. Very, very unfortunately. People are dying because of doctors, hospitals policymakers, and government officials disputing this.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Virta Health is careful to use the phrase &quot;remission&quot;.  Right now officially T2D is viewed as progressive and degenerative.  Getting the word out that actually if you eat yourself (it&#39;s food based, I think we all get that) into T2D, you have caused damage to your metabolic systems and their normal regulation. </p>

<p>While I think that keto can transition to low-carb for recovered T2D, we need long term data to know for sure.</p>

<p>Certainly going back to beer and pizza, donuts and breadsticks with pasta dinners, these things would likely result in regaining the T2D state.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Ok, I. An call it an antidote to diabetes, not a cure directly. It depends on how much poison do you consume.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>No, people dispute this all the time, unfortunately. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, sadly. Eventhough an overwhelming amount of science is already there, people try to prove their old broken dogmas work, because their world would shatter. Bias in medicine is literally killing thousands.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What&#39;s interesting is the treatment for T2D long before invention of medications was ketogenic style diets.  Check out this cookbook from 1917: <a href="https://archive.org/details/diabeticcookeryr00oppeiala">https://archive.org/details/diabeticcookeryr00oppeiala</a> (Diabetic Cookery by Rebecca Oppenheimer)</p>

<p>I think in the future, the 1950-now era is doing to be known as the dark ages of nutrition science.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>One big issue is that not everyone is willing to pursue a low carb diet even if it can greatly improve their health, due to preferences or cost. There is not point in putting every single person on a low carb diet, and tailoring a regime of insulin and oral drugs to control that diet in hospital, when they go back into the real world and eat completely differently. </p>

<p>That&#39;s already a big enough problem a it is. These diabetic hospital diets are still far less carbs then some of these people are eating at home. Then they go home and the regime that was working in hospital doesn&#39;t work at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It’s so sad 🙁 have seen it in the last year with 2 relatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I see. Do you consider carbohydrates poison?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Bias in medicine is literally killing thousands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly! It breaks my heart! I wish there was something I could do, but there are already so many smart people (doctors, researchers, etc) speaking out already. People will only change once they&#39;re willing to listen.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I think in the future, the 1950-now era is doing to be known as the dark ages of nutrition science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OMG! I can&#39;t agree more!! We&#39;re in the dark ages for sure! Lol! Hopefully enough people are starting to see the light that things will change soon</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>You have to differentiate people who are non-compliant with people told they HAVE TO eat (mostly refined!) carbohydrates at every meal.</p>

<p>There is every point to recommending at least low-carb to anyone who is even pre-diabetic.  When the diet recommended doesn&#39;t result in improvement - and the standard T2D does not - then patients lose faith that their doctors and the medical establishment knows anything useful about nutrition.  They&#39;re right, but then most people view keto as non-mainstream and reject it.</p>

<p>Virta Health is for profit, sure, same as doctors and big pharma, but what they are doing is cracking open that door just a little bit with clinical trials and clean data.  The word is out there that DOCTORS recommend keto and then it&#39;s just the fight to get insurance companies on board.</p>

<p>Going home and having telemedicine support is a game changer.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one of the topics in the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just as exciting is the fact that 74% of all patients who began the clinical trial were still taking part in the Virta Treatment. As context, 20% of new prescriptions for chronic diseases go unfilled, and among those filled, approximately 50% are taken incorrectly. In other words, our patients are more likely to follow the Virta Treatment than the average person is to just “take a pill”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ketogenic diets are easy to stick to <em>if</em> said person can get over the old and busted conventional wisdom.  The food choices are amazing - all the things mainstream &quot;experts&quot; recommend against are back on the menu: ribeye steak, chicken wings, bacon, butter, cheese, full fat dairy, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>These diabetic hospital diets are still far less carbs then some of these people are eating at home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That may be true for some of them, but in my husband&#39;s experience, these patients are complaining that they&#39;re struggling to control their blood sugar at the hospital. They have an easier time controling it at home. And these are not people who are low-carbers. </p>

<p>Either way, diabetes education needs to be severely improved. Patients, doctors and hospital dietitians need to be educated about the benefits of lower carbs to treat diabetes. Many people still believe that you&#39;ll die if you eat under 100 grams of carbs a day. It&#39;s so ridiculous!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Its an analogy.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>We are for sure on the right track!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I personally love those food choices, but I also love lemon squares so I had to learn how to cook with swerve..</p>

<p>The 20% of new Rx being unfilled is really interesting (and the 50% taking them wrong, how many are cutting dosage due to cost?  At least metformin is cheap.).</p>

<p>The 2 month results from Virta were a serious selling point, backed with the 2 year result.  It&#39;s like look, you can almost instantly get your BG down, lose some fat and lower your medications.  Two months.</p>

<p>Keep at it for two years and most people will be in complete remission.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am just really interested in learning as much as I can on the general subject. But right now i have 0 knowledge. Any reccomendations?</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>Get a food scale and download a nutrition/calorie counting app. Learn what macronutrients (fat, carbs, protien) are in food, how much you should have of what, then look up what they do in the body. Then do the same thing with micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). You will learn a ton starting with the food you eat.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>For a broad view of the academic consensus on healthy eating, I recommend starting with the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/">public education materials provided by Harvard&#39;s School of Public Health</a>, including the back issues of their newsletter.</p>

<p>For individual essential micronutrients, the <a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic">Linus Pauling Center&#39;s Micronutrient Information Center</a> is a useful resource. </p>

<p>Lower down on the trust worthiness scale (there&#39;s some cherry picking), but heavily referenced, is <a href="http://www.whfoods.com/foodstoc.php">George Mateljan Foundation&#39;s World&#39;s Healthiest Foods</a> website.</p>

<p>Beyond that, one is headed either into more academic territory with textbooks (I reference <a href="https://b-ok.cc/book/2320751/23965f">Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease</a> all the time) or more biased sources favoring particular diets, including fad diets. Should you get obsessed, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">Pubmed</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Scholar</a> facilitate searching the literature.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The wiki for this sub</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Wikipedia is a great resource. Just look up a vitamin on there and start learning! If you don’t know a word, look it up!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What is your science background? </p>

<p>I think that understanding the metabolic background of protein/fat/carbs is pretty important.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Is biochemistry a good place to start? Asking for myself. Especially if you want to stick to known facts (instead of say (biased) inferences from epidemiological studies)</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The Magic Pill.
Certainly, a lot of it is anecdotal, but the trial of Dr Noakes(?), really helped me realize that a lot of what we thought we knew about nutrition is based on bad science. It kind of gives you a clean foundation to start building on. Some people think it&#39;s a meat thing, but the basic principles are achievable for vegans as well, although it does require more dedication.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My rec is to watch ALL the food documentaries. Partially to understand that there are a lot of different opinions and often one is not more valid than the other. I would also recommend, if you have the inclination, whenever the documentary mentions something you find compelling, pause it and look it up yourself. There are a great deal of studies available free online, and I&#39;ve found statements before that are blatantly incorrect.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Watch the TED talk &quot;What is the best diet for humans?&quot; by Eran Segal.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks a lot:) Will start doing that right away</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid the wiki seems to have a &quot;plant bias&quot;. For example, it lists <a href="https://deniseminger.com/2011/09/22/forks-over-knives-is-the-science-legit-a-review-and-critique/">Forks over Knives</a> in documentary section but not <a href="https://www.foodlies.org/">Food Lies</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>known facts (instead of say (biased) inferences from epidemiological studies)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Biochemistry is great and all, and it does show that substance X in system Y does Z. However, we still are using model systems, which may not reflect what is going on &quot;in real life&quot;. For instance, even if our substance X (a nutritional compound found in some seeds) would theoretically act as a co-factor in an important cellular process a lot of things can go wrong: 1. Abosrbtion into the body might not go as expected (due to individual differences in transporters, &quot;anti-nutrients&quot;, or cooking method hindering it). 2. Even if absorbed, and if reaching the site of the organ we are interested in, there might be another factor interfering with binding (an enzyme, or just some signalling molecule interfering with the binding) that we didn&#39;t include in our model system. 3. Even if binding happens as expected in our target organ to our target receptor (as modeled) the downstreams effects may not be what we expected due to completely incalculable factors (some gene changes happening, some other changes it does in an other organ inhibiting pathways etc. etc.)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Oops a bit long comment. My point with this is that biochemistry will tell you how things &quot;work&quot; in a very limited way. I love it, and I love understanding the pathways involved with different things. But even for very targeted drugs we have unexpected reactions... For something with relatively vague binding profiles like nutritional compounds it&#39;s even more difficult to predict or understand the &quot;facts&quot; as such. That&#39;s why we need (good) epidemiological studies. We can&#39;t do large scale perfect placebo-controlled trials for everything, and need to know what to look at! Biochemistry may provide a mechanism, but they do not provide the context.  </p>

<p>Just so you know where I&#39;m coming from: I&#39;ve done quite some cellular science stuff and only have a vague understanding of epidemiology (more drug research stuff, but some nutrition too).</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the trial of Dr Noakes(?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting. More about this in wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In February 2014 a registered dietician complained to the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) that Noakes tweeted to a mother that she should wean her baby onto low-carbohydrate, high-fat foods, which he described as real foods. The HPCSA held a hearing about the allegation against Noakes over the next few years. Controversially, on 28 October 2016, the HPSCA incorrectly released a statement announcing that Noakes had been found guilty of misconduct. In a second press release issued over three hours later, the HPSCA apologised for the mistake.[14] Noakes was cleared of misconduct in April 2017.[15][16] The HPSCA lost its appeal in June 2018.<br/>
[..]<br/>
Noakes co-wrote the 2017 book Lore of Nutrition with journalist Marika Sboros.[19] In it Noakes describes his Damascene conversion to low-carbohydrate dieting, explores how the lipid hypothesis is the &quot;biggest mistake in modern medicine&quot; and details his struggles with the medical establishment.<br/>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>I recently found this on Netflix and I loved it. Changed my perspective</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It also lists Denise Minger, Gary Taubes, and Weston A Price. I would love it if all the nonscientific sources including Forks Over Knives were removed.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>As the other poster said, we have quite a few low-carb and low-plant sources as well.  We attempted to include materials from all sides.  From a perusal of your link, Food Lies has not yet been released so I am not surprised it hasn&#39;t been added yet.  I wouldn&#39;t personally add a source that hasn&#39;t been examined by at least a few mods.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The entire trial is on youtube.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OT_S6fDxR0&amp;list=PLPda1Yn6bpO6DG_b5_wAVXf100niaaJDX">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OT_S6fDxR0&amp;list=PLPda1Yn6bpO6DG_b5_wAVXf100niaaJDX</a></p>

<p>surprisingly interesting watch.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps we could consider adding some disclaimers to the descriptions of certain books and documentaries?  There is literally no author, book, doctor, or documentary that someone somewhere won&#39;t claim is biased in one way or another so our &#39;Recommended Reading&#39; and &#39;Recommended Documentaries&#39; sections would be entirely empty if we excluded every source that different people felt was biased.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>that would be amazing, at least this sub should be a last bastion on reddit versus the pop nutritional scientists of the various plant-based, keto and carnivore religions.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Bias isn&#39;t the problem so much as poor and misleading science. There are researchers who could write an evidence based book about low-carb diets and their usefulness for weight loss and diabetes management. But Gary Taubes is a journalist whose ideas have been shown time and time again by the scientific community to <a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/gary-taubes-and-the-cause-of-obesity/">be</a> <a href="https://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2011/08/carbohydrate-hypothesis-of-obesity.html">completely</a> <a href="https://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2011/08/carbohydrate-hypothesis-of-obesity.html">wrong</a>. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if any documentaries should be on the recommendation list of a place called &quot;scientific nutrition&quot;. Not only are they always biased, but they are created by people who have even less scientific knowledge than most authors, and they don&#39;t even have references.</p>

<p>Is there a free university intro to nutrition course available online? That would be a good recommendation. Maybe <a href="http://ocw.jhsph.edu/index.cfm/go/viewCourse/course/HumanNutrition/coursePage/index/">this?</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>While <em>I</em> agree with that statement, the Wiki is editable by any mod and therefore each mod has made different contributions as time has gone by.  I have asked the other mods for further input so I would expect to see some other mod comments here in the next day or two.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>MOOC-list has <a href="https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/food-nutrition">a good list</a> of free online nutrition-related courses.  I can talk with the other mods and see about adding that to the Wiki!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I’m totally open to changing the wiki. We want to make it a starting point for people who are new to learning about nutrition science. We will consider any suggestions to improve it, including this one.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The book list will mature over time. Those types of lists are the default things added to wikis, and it&#39;s natural the mods added books they&#39;ve personally read. The list is perhaps a bit stale now since most of us are now skipping the books and reading original research. But anyone is free to send the mods a message with their recommendations.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Please take my statement with a pinch of salt. The results are interesting and they imply further research in humans but...</p>

<p><strong>I&#39;m not a rodent.</strong> Human ketone levels will differ. For example, when dogs go into ketosis, they have tiny levels in comparison to humans. Cats DON&#39;T do well with ketosis at all.</p>

<p>That all said, why couldn&#39;t they start doing this study with humans? I thought that there was already a sizable population actively seeking ketosis?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Ketone bodies are the most energy-efficient fuel and yield more ATP per mole of substrate than pyruvate and increase the free energy released from ATP hydrolysis. Elevation of circulating ketones via high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets has been used for the treatment of drug-refractory epilepsy and for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson&#39;s disease. Ketones may also be beneficial for muscle and brain in times of stress, such as endurance exercise. The challenge has been to raise circulating ketone levels by using a palatable diet without altering lipid levels. We found that blood ketone levels can be increased and cholesterol and triglycerides decreased by feeding rats a novel ketone ester diet: chow that is supplemented with (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate as 30% of calories. For 5 d, rats on the ketone diet ran 32% further on a treadmill than did control rats that ate an isocaloric diet that was supplemented with either corn starch or palm oil (P &lt; 0.05). Ketone-fed rats completed an 8-arm radial maze test 38% faster than did those on the other diets, making more correct decisions before making a mistake (P &lt; 0.05). Isolated, perfused hearts from rats that were fed the ketone diet had greater free energy available from ATP hydrolysis during increased work than did hearts from rats on the other diets as shown by using [31P]-NMR spectroscopy. The novel ketone diet, therefore, improved physical performance and cognitive function in rats, and its energy-sparing properties suggest that it may help to treat a range of human conditions with metabolic abnormalities.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Exogenous ketones in rats will be different from them being on a ketogenic diet, which isn&#39;t healthy for them.  Adding exogenous ketones will be extra fuel for the brain with minimal side effects, similar to the work done in humans with Alzheimers.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6356942/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6356942/</a></p>

<p>No reason they cant. Probably chose rat model because its cheaper and easier to control confounding variables.</p>

<p>anecdotally many report better mental function, there are plausible mechanistic reasons to believe this. There was a recent study showing no change in mental function on &quot;Healthy&quot; Humans so this may be dependent on some prior dysfunction that keto resolves or to short study time not allowing for proper fat adaption which could take as long as 3-6 months. </p>

<p>On the performance side  there are some long distance runners who are dominating using a ketogenic diet. </p>

<p>On the more explosive side i would say that currently the evidence points to unchanged performance or negative.  </p>

<p>My own theory is that keto will probably improve recovery which could help with many performance related things. Keto for explosive performance probably require higher protein intake than what is typically recommended one example of this is Shawn Baker who is Doing extremely well in a highly glycolytic activity (short distance rowing).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Edit: Someone pointed out that there&#39;s always glucose in your blood and I agree. We&#39;re talking about DIETARY glucose here. Gluconeogenesis is a thing that your body does because you NEED some levels of glucose. I&#39;m talking about having LOW levels of glucose such that your insulin is lowered and therefore ketosis can occur. I don&#39;t say you will finish every last drop in your blood. I mean that your insulin to glucagon ratio drops to a level that allows ketosis to occur.</p>

<p>It is my unpopular belief that once you have enough glucose in your bloodstream to cause <strong>an insulin response</strong>, it&#39;s the same as having alcohol in your system. Hear me out...</p>

<p>Ketosis is the natural state for humans (according to Amber Hearn) which we evolved to adapt to the most recent ice age. We still have the ability to process other fuel sources but fats are the best (as evidenced by your study showing how ketones are more efficient).</p>

<p>When you eat carbs/sugar, your body stops trying to burn fats and preferentially chooses glucose instead. But what if we change the wording and say, &quot;Your body stops burning fats in order to get rid of sugars first&quot; ? When you&#39;re not burning sugar, your body increases autophagy and studies are showing that we increase stem cell production. In my mind, that is equivalent to &quot;<strong>sugars suppress autophagy and stem cell production.</strong>&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>You always have glucose in your bloodstream</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>That’s very unscientific for a subreddit called scientific nutrition. You’re certainly entitled to your belief, but what evidence do you present to suggest it has merit?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The pathway to ketosis is regulated by the ratio of insulin to glucagon. For this one, I&#39;m going to reference a video by researcher Dr. Benjamin Bikman PhD - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3fO5aTD6JU">&#39;Insulin vs. Glucagon: The relevance of dietary protein&#39;</a>. I&#39;m going to trust that the actual studies that he references in there are legit.</p>

<p>He explains in the video that when eating a diet with carbohydrates that protein has an effect on insulin. There is a slide where insulin goes up by as much as 40x. But when you cut out carbs, protein does not have the same effect on insulin - insulin remains pretty much the same (in healthy, non-obese individuals*). The ultimate takeaway  is that when insulin goes down, ketosis goes up. </p>

<p>For fun, he poses a challenge. He says that the only cells that don&#39;t have mitochondria are red blood cells. Your brain cells all have mitochondria and therefore don&#39;t actually NEED glucose. He said that he&#39;s never seen a study proving it.</p>

<p>It is not needed, but glucose is the preferred fuel for the brain. This is why it only transitions to ketones when glucose availability is low</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>There are cellular functions that require glucose. That doesn’t mean you need dietary glucose. That’s why gluconeogenesis is a thing</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I want to declare upfront that I did not have the time thus far to read this verbatim.</p>

<p>Your second article is specific to fasting which is not a ketogenic diet. Though there may be some overlap, the article specifically addresses periods of not eating - not what happens when we eat. </p>

<p>I’m not sure I buy the idea that we evolved to be ketogenic as a primary energy process. We are <em>very</em>  good at using carbohydrates as a primary energy source. I haven’t seen any credible evidence to support that.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>But that was my original hypothesis. The alternative perspective is that glucose is not preferred by actually less desirable. Hence my comparison to alcohol.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying that alcohol is the preferred fuel for the liver which is why your liver prioritizes alcohol first. See what I mean?</p>

<p>Your brain (and all cells) prioritize glucose. It is maybe an evolutionary adaptation to try finish using exogenous energy sources and only switch to fat burning once that fuel is complete. But just because it uses it up first doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s the ideal fuel.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Ethanol is preferred fuel over glucose so therefore we should mainly fuel our self with alcohol...</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Work looking at Alzheimer&#39;s and exogenous ketones shows the brain will take up ketones even in the presence of glucose - and use it for fuel.</p>

<p>Also &quot;In contrast, several studies show that brain ketone uptake increases in direct proportion to the rise in blood ketone concentrations, irrespective of brain activity(Blomqvistet al.,1995,2002; Cunnaneet al.,2011; Nugentet al.,2014b). &quot;  <a href="https://www.ocl-journal.org/articles/ocl/pdf/2016/01/ocl150017.pdf">https://www.ocl-journal.org/articles/ocl/pdf/2016/01/ocl150017.pdf</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Hold on - you&#39;re arguing about that? My original comment was about dietary glucose. Read the wording again please - I specifically used the following words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>When you eat carbs/sugar</strong>, your body stops trying to burn fats and preferentially chooses glucose instead.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>So why do we experience things like post lunch drowsiness with carbs (even protein from carnivore diets) and not keto?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Interesting thoughts! </p>

<p>I want to add some quotes from how this topic is described in research. Overall, we see the term &quot;alternative fuel source&quot; being used a lot. And ketone bodies are described as &quot;sparing&quot; carbohydrates. If the argument is that ketones are superior, why are they described as a carb-sparing, alternative fuel source for times of starvation/fasting/low carb? Basically, a backup solution (albeit the diet can have many advantages)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The evolutionary effect of ketone bodies is therefore to spare carbohydrate reserves, and muscle protein, whilst themselves being an alternative energy source.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...glucose is ordinarily the sole fuel for the human brain [24]. After 3–4 days of fasting or a very low carbohydrate diet the CNS needs an alternative energy source [19,20,21,22]</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike most other tissues, the brain cannot utilize fatty acids for energy when blood glucose levels become compromised. In this case, ketone bodies provide the brain with an alternative source of energy, amounting to nearly 2/3 of the brain&#39;s energy needs during periods of prolonged fasting and starvation.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I looked up your claim and there seem to be some nuances:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Brain metabolism may partially include acetate as a by-product of ethanol</p></li>
<li><p>The brain does not <em>prefer</em> ethanol from what I could find</p></li>
<li><p>We should not fuel the brain with alcohol daily as it will lead to serious health degradation, something which cannot be said for glucose</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>These findings corroborate our hypothesis that heavy alcohol consumption facilitates use of alternative energy substrates (i.e., acetate) for resting activity during intoxication, which might persist through early sobriety, but indicate that <strong>glucose is still favored as energy substrate during brain stimulation</strong>. Our findings are consistent with reduced reliance on glucose as the main energy substrate for resting brain metabolism during intoxication (<strong>presumably shifting to acetate or other ketones</strong>) and a priming of this shift in HDs, which might make them vulnerable to energy deficits during withdrawal.</p>

A low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet reduces body mass without compromising performance in powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting athletes. J Strength Cond Res 32(12): 3382-3391, 2018-Weight class athletes use weight-making strategies to compete in specific weight categories with an optimum power-to-weight ratio. There is evidence that low carbohydrate diets might offer specific advantages for weight reduction without the negative impact on strength and power previously hypothesized to accompany carbohydrate restriction. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) could be used as a weight reduction strategy for athletes competing in the weight class sports of powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting. Fourteen intermediate to elite competitive lifting athletes (age 34 ± 10.5, n = 5 female) consumed an ad libitum usual diet (UD) (>250 g daily intake of carbohydrates) and an ad libitum LCKD (≤50 g or ≤10% daily intake of carbohydrates) in random order, each for 3 months in a crossover design. Lifting performance, body composition, resting metabolic rate, blood glucose, and blood electrolytes were measured at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The LCKD phase resulted in significantly lower body mass (-3.26 kg, p = 0.038) and lean mass (-2.26 kg, p = 0.016) compared with the UD phase.

Instead, VS reduced alcohol-induced decreases in whole-brain glucose metabolism (10 ± 12%) compared with NS in both groups (15 ± 13%, p = 0.04), consistent with stimulation-related glucose metabolism enhancement. These findings corroborate our hypothesis that heavy alcohol consumption facilitates use of alternative energy substrates (i.e., acetate) for resting activity during intoxication, which might persist through early sobriety, but indicate that glucose is still favored as energy substrate during brain stimulation. Our findings are consistent with reduced reliance on glucose as the main energy substrate for resting brain metabolism during intoxication (presumably shifting to acetate or other ketones) and a priming of this shift in HDs, which might make them vulnerable to energy deficits during withdrawal.","DOI":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4877-14.2015","extra":"PMID: 25698759\nPMCID: PMC4331638","title":"Alcohol Decreases Baseline Brain Glucose Metabolism More in Heavy Drinkers Than Controls But Has No Effect on Stimulation-Induced Metabolic Increases","volume":"35","issue":"7","pages":"3248-3255","date":"2015-2-18","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4331638/","libraryCatalog":"PubMed Central","accessDate":"2019-07-02T20:38:59Z"}]

<div class="md"><p>Disclaimer:  I debated posting this since it&#39;s a hot-button issue but then I recalled that the one of the primary reasons for this sub is to post interesting and useful analyses of nutrition research.  Since these types of discussions usually lead to some heated comments, I am adding this disclaimer in the hopes that we all keep our chill here.  It&#39;s entirely fair to agree or disagree with the conclusions of the article and analysis is always encouraged!</p>

<p>EDIT: As <a href="/u/flowersandmtns">/u/flowersandmtns</a> helpfully pointed out, these studies have also been discussed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bmgktg/glucose_and_lipid_homeostasis_and_inflammation_in/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bwq6z1/effects_of_red_meat_white_meat_and_nonmeat/">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>There are few interesting tidbits from the article but the section discussing the increased CRP on the keto diet has a reasonable conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is reasonable therefore to regard the effect of the ketogenic diet on CRP as potentially real. This is important, because although professional cardiovascular disease researchers believe both lipids and inflammation are important for cardiovascular disease (and other factors) inflammation is frequently proposed as the sole cause of cardiovascular disease by many non-scientist advocates of low-carbohydrate diets. Yet, if both harmful lipids and major inflammatory markers like CRP are increased on a low-carbohydrate diet, then this poses a problem for the claim that low-carbohydrate dieting is innocuous for cardiovascular disease risk.</p>

<p><strong>To be clear, for many people, most markers of cardiovascular disease risk (including LDL cholesterol and CRP) will decrease on a low-carbohydrate diet if weight loss is robust enough (see, e.g., here and here). However, what the studies above suggest is that if weight is maintainable at these lower levels after switching to a higher-carbohydrate diet, on average these lipid and inflammatory markers will improve still further. A key unresolved question is whether the ability to maintain such weight loss on a low-carbohydrate diet sufficiently compensates for the increases in these cardiovascular disease markers, if long-term weight maintenance on a low-carbohydrate diet is preferred. I suspect that it is–and thus, for those who can only maintain their weight loss on a low-carbohydrate diet, the tradeoff may on balance be worthwhile. But this remains to be seen. (Also, this may depend on the extent of the weight loss. More long-term weight loss would more likely justify the tradeoff.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Both studies have been discussed here and neither is accurately reflected in the breathless title of that &quot;Nutritional Evolution&quot; blog.</p>

<p>First study was looking at a 4 week keto diet and then a challenge meal.  Yes, we know LDL is often raised on a keto diet.  Let&#39;s focus on that instead of the higher HDL, lower trigs, lower BG, lower insulin and weight loss.  Also the rise in inflammation markers was in response to a refined carb meal. </p>

<p>Second study is the red vs white meat study.</p>

<p>Their summary is &quot;According to these studies, because low-carbohydrate diets high in meat  and saturated fat are likely to, on average, raise both inflammatory and  lipid biomarkers in healthy people&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s not quite entirely accurate though.  And I&#39;m irritated they keep harping on &quot;high in meat&quot; rather than &quot;high in fat&quot; because it makes them seem like they have a vegan agenda and don&#39;t actually understand nutritional ketosis.</p>

<p>Without the challenge meal, a keto diet lowers inflammation markers.  Without the challenge meal, a keto diet lowers trigs and does raise BOTH LDL and HDL.  </p>

<p>They go on, &quot;–if avoiding atherosclerosis is the  goal, then minimizing animal-sourced protein while maximizing other  high-nutrient foods is likely to be best practice according to the  totality of current evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah so this isn&#39;t about a high-fat diet at all, really, it&#39;s about animal products.  Got it.</p>

<p>&quot;There may be plausible arguments in favor  of low-carbohydrate diets if they help to maintain a sufficient degree  of weight loss to mitigate the inflammatory or lipid effects of these  diets.&quot;</p>

<p>Ok great!  Or, you know, if overall inflammation is lowered, which is is.  And if low trigs and high HDL are good, which they are.  </p>

<p>&quot; Likewise, among persons with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, the  euglycemic effects of low-carbohydrate diets may outweigh any negatives. &quot;</p>

<p>Exactly.  There are a LOT of people with T2D and pre-diabetes out there.</p>

<p>&quot;However, all else equal, it may be appropriate to exercise caution  about committing to low-carbohydrate diets if weight and glucose can be  optimally maintained with other dietary strategies.&quot;</p>

<p>I disagree, and their arguments aren&#39;t well made to support their view.</p>

<p>Oh!  This is the guy who posted about &quot;<a href="https://nutritionalrevolution.org/2019/05/18/macronutrients-part-3/">The  data do not support the idea that the low-fat dietary guidelines caused  the obesity epidemic. (A reply to Dr. Ludwig’s response–Part 3 in the  macronutrient trend series.)</a>&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The increased CRP in the study cited was in response to a high-CHO meal (one meal, probably reasonably decent).  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3845365/">Consuming a hypocaloric high fat low carbohydrate diet for 12 weeks lowers C-reactive protein, and raises serum adiponectin and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol in obese subjects</a></p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&quot;Additionally, in our Virta/IUH study of patients with type 2 diabetes,  both WBC count and CRP were dramatically reduced in the ketogenic diet  group compared to the usual care group at 1 and 2-year follow-up (27,  28). In particular, the reduction in CRP in the ketogenic diet group at 1  year was comparable in magnitude (35-40%) to what is seen with the most  potent statin drug.&quot;  <a href="https://blog.virtahealth.com/inflammation-ketosis-diabetes/">https://blog.virtahealth.com/inflammation-ketosis-diabetes/</a></p>

<p>Furthermore looking at that study focused on the KD diet lower C-reactive protein in response to that one meal, the KD diet group had an expected higher BG after the one meal because of the known effect of physiological glucose sparing.  More interesting to me is that BOTH groups had MINIMAL BG responses to the KD meal and LOWER insulin response! (Figure 1).  </p>

<p>For T2D, which is characterized by hyperinsulinemia, the paper shows a KD meal is far better in terms of glucose excursions and insulin requirements by the body.</p>

<p>High meat is specified because low-carb/keto is possible with varying amounts of meat. Even meatless ketogenic diets are possible. Low-carb diets with less meat do not have the same effects on lipid profiles.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Same as above. You can still do high-fat, low-carb diets with less animal products, which I&#39;ve actually heard of  responsible low-carb physicians mention doing with their patients.</p>

<p>Believe carbs aren&#39;t bad, and an excess of fat isn&#39;t good, and people will say you&#39;ve a &quot;vegan agenda.&quot; That&#39;s the sad, tribal state nutrition has reached in the blogosphere. This guy doesn&#39;t always have positive things to say about vegan diets, he just happens not to buy into many of the low-carb ideas floating around which gives him some common ground with vegans. But to imply he might have a vegan agenda because of that is silly.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>&quot;Yeah so this isn&#39;t about a high-fat diet at all, really, it&#39;s about animal products. Got it.&quot;</p>

<p>It is about both, have you Read the study?</p>

<p>LDL cholesterol and apoB were higher with red and white meat than with nonmeat, independent of SFA content (P &lt; 0.0001 for all, except apoB: red meat compared with nonmeat [P = 0.0004]).</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I disagree, and their arguments aren&#39;t well made to support their view.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No arguments are necessary. I&#39;m reporting the data. A ketogenic diet (the Hall study) raised CRP and LDL. High-meat and high-SFA (the Krauss study) both independently raised LDL vs. their lower-meat, lower-SFA counterparts. You can cite weight loss studies or harp on whatever, but from a weight-maintaining point of view, the data are clear. As far as I can tell, the only question is whether weight maintenance (at an optimal bodyweight, that is) is achievable for a given person on a higher-carbohydrate intake. If it is, then all else equal and on average, these biomarker results would point to a lower-meat, lower-SFA, higher-carb diet as being optimal. I&#39;m also not a vegan, as I try to stay away from extremes. I&#39;ve done keto several times and plan to do it again. I was also low-carb for 10 years. All of this is irrelevant though, or should be. Let us make this about the science, not our egos or dietary preferences.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thank you for your summary. I don’t understand how these studies make it to this subreddit, they are so blatantly confirming a bias. I just want to add the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, all else equal, it may be appropriate to exercise caution about committing to low-carbohydrate diets if weight and glucose can be optimally maintained with other dietary strategies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what’s wrong with, and touches on the core cognitive dissonance in nutritional advice given to diabetics. When you have a disease related to an inability to tolerate a substance, you do everything you can to omit that substance. </p>

<p>Therefore it would seem logical to do away with or limit carbs if your are diabetic. Every diabetic knows (or should know) how to count carbs. In some cases you can manage a high carbohydrate diet with medication; at least one would assume so by the discrete intervals the are measured. But these are the exceptions that place everyone who can’t into danger. Insulin efficiency has a serious margin of error, and the law of large numbers applies. However, there is still a delay before any medication has an effect. In that brief window, you’re wreaking havoc on your micro vascular system. </p>

<p>It is generally accepted that every diabetic will face complications in their lifetimes. I argue that it’s due to the quoted advice above and the common misconception of “just bolus for it” that complications are still rampant. Obviously they don’t mention which methods, but I haven’t encountered any other effective ones other than the very one they deter from.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Consuming a hypocaloric high fat low carbohydrate diet for 12 weeks lowers C-reactive protein, and raises serum adiponectin and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol in obese subjects</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was a weight-loss study and the Bass analysis is discussing effects during weight maintenance.  Additionally, the CRP benefits were barely significant (p=.03) and the diets were <em>extremely</em> protein mismatched (22% vs 33.5% of calories).  Also, their dietary measurements were much inferior to the Hall study which used a metabolic ward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All subjects completed take home 3-day food records (two weekdays and one weekend day) every two weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>&quot;The increased CRP in the study cited was in response to a high-CHO meal (one meal, probably reasonably decent).&quot;  </p>

<p>That is incorrect. The CRP in the study was measured in the fasted state.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The one study by Hall did show CRP raised, which other studies did not show.  The rise in LDL is however consistent with other works, as is the lowering of trigs and the rise in HDL.</p>

<p>If you wish to keep this about accurate science, then refer to the keto diet as a high-fat diet as one can do vegetarian or even vegan keto.</p>

<p>You were looking at weight maintenance then?  Hall&#39;s study was isocaloric so that makes sense and generally studies about keto are looking at weight loss.  Even when trying to be isocaloric people tend to lose weight on a KD.  I&#39;ll see if there are other studies about KD that are isocaloric and look at inflammation (though they tend to be in elite level athletes and not so applicable to mere mortals who like to exercise).</p>

<p>Excess fatty acids also cause insulin resistance.  The issue is not carbs, it&#39;s the total calories.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4038351/">What causes the insulin resistance underlying obesity?
</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Work to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the relationship between obesity and insulin resistance in humans continues to support the concept that visceral obesity, but not subcutaneous, results in insulin resistance and increased risk of T2DM. <strong>The mechanisms by which visceral obesity results in insulin resistance appear to be related to excess lipid accumulation in liver. This may be due to excess fatty acids from visceral adipose tissue draining into the portal vein. Excess lipid accumulation may result in impaired insulin signaling through cell autonomous mechanisms, or through the induction of inflammation and the subsequent production of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, which impair insulin action.</strong> Storage of excess fat in subcutaneous depots mitigates the risk of insulin resistance and T2DM, possibly by preventing accumulation of fat in visceral adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle. Thus, the mechanisms that determine the size and expandability of subcutaneous adipose tissue depots, such as the control of extracellular matrix and capillary expansion, may be important targets for future therapy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4587882/">The role of fatty acids in insulin resistance</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It appears that insulin resistance starts in the hypothalamus causing a disruption in the balance of satiety and hunger signals. This leads to overconsumption of calories. <strong>Although excess calories can be theoretically stored safely in the adipose tissue, as the inflammation increases in this organ and insulin resistance develops in the fat cells, the ability to safely store excess fat is compromised. One of the consequences of insulin resistance in the adipose tissue is that excess fat is released into the blood stream and is sequestered by other organs (liver and skeletal muscles) that are not equipped to safely store this excess fat. This is the start of lipotoxicity. With increased lipotoxicity, the metabolism and energy generation becomes compromised, and the development of chronic diseases (diabetes, heart disease, and polycystic ovary syndrome) associated with insulin resistance becomes accelerated. The levels of fat in the diet and the composition of those fatty acids in the fat component can have a significant role in the modulation of insulin resistance.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>When you have a disease related to an inability to tolerate a substance, you do everything you can to omit that substance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or you could fix that intolerance rather than making it worse with a high fat diet. Let’s treat the underlying cause (insulin resistance), not the symptoms (hyperglycemia)</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yeah, good points.  I need to look up what Hall used for the KD/CD one meal.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My mistake.</p>

<p>So their results contradict other work showing a KD lowers CRP.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Weight was lost on both BD and KD. It wasn&#39;t a characteristic unique to the KD phase. The researchers made a mistake and underestimated energy expenditure at baseline. People do not lose weight on isocaloric KD when protein is the same. Weight loss on KD is comparable to weight loss on other high-quality diets, so studies that show CRP improvement with large amount of weight loss are confounded by the weight loss. The idea is to identify the best diet for weight loss or weight loss maintenance, from a biomarker point of view.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The mechanisms by which visceral obesity results in insulin resistance appear to be related to excess lipid accumulation in liver.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the part that interests me the most.  There seems to be agreement that accumulation of visceral fat is the trigger for metabolic syndrome and issues.</p>

<p>The big question is what results in visceral fat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This may be due to excess fatty acids from visceral adipose tissue draining into the portal vein. Excess lipid accumulation may result in impaired insulin signaling through cell autonomous mechanisms, or through the induction of inflammation and the subsequent production of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, which impair insulin action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both of those are &quot;may&quot;, meaning they are guessing/hypothesizing.</p>

<p>There&#39;s work showing REMOVING fat from the liver is causal with sugar/fructose consumption, which to me says it&#39;s not fat consumption related.  And this one showed increase of DNL in the liver in response to fructose.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4454806/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4454806/</a></p>

<p>High trigs are associated with a high refined carbohydrate diet, particularly a low-fat one.  </p>

<p>The reason you can be skinny fat and T2D or overweight and metabolically healthy is that subcutaneous fat isn&#39;t the important factor, liver and other visceral fat is.  </p>

<p>(Just to be clear, a whole foods high carbohydrate diet seems quite healthy.)</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thank you. These are some great resources, but the links don&#39;t work. Is the site down?</p>

<p>However,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excess fatty acids also cause insulin resistance. The issue is not carbs, it&#39;s the total calories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By what mechanism?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mechanisms by which visceral obesity results in insulin resistance appear to be related to excess lipid accumulation in liver.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where are the excess fatty acids coming from?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This may be due to excess fatty acids from visceral adipose tissue draining into the portal vein.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the problem is the excess fat storage. Insulin is the fat storing hormone, and what triggers excess fat storage. </p>

<p>I believe you have placed the carriage before the horse.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Or you could fix it with the real intolerance which is carbs. By the way, the 1950s called, they want their blinding, crippling diet advice back.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Weight loss will usually decrease CRP. Weight loss is profoundly anti-inflammatory. This study was designed to be weight-maintaining (though it underestimated energy expenditure at baseline and weight was lost on both BD and KD). Can you show me a study that was weight-maintaining that showed a reduction in CRP, or didn&#39;t show an increase? To repeat, it is critically important to evaluate nutrition studies on the basis of whether weight is lost; even modest weight loss profoundly improves most health markers, independently of how that weight was lost. This includes CRP; it is flawed to conclude that KD improves CRP in a study with massive weight loss. KD does not produce superior weight loss compared to other high-quality diets when good meta-analysis methods are used, therefore weight loss should not be considered a characteristic of KD in contrast with other high-quality diets, therefore weight loss is a CONFOUNDER.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes that seems likely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And this one showed increase of DNL in the liver in response to fructose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My only issue with that study is that it doesn&#39;t tell us anything we don&#39;t already know, mainly that refined liquid sugar is worse for you than complex carbohydrates.  I mean, it&#39;s always good to have &#39;proof&#39; but there is literally no one anywhere that is recommending a diet comprised of 25% liquid fructose.  It would have been (to me) more interesting if they had tested a 25% fructose diet comprised of real food (which could only be done with large amounts of fruit I imagine).  At least then we could see what happens when someone is consuming large amounts of a food group that is traditionally considered very healthy (fruits).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, some people get &#39;lucky&#39; in that their body is able to store large amounts of visceral fat before developing any symptoms of lipotoxicity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Just to be clear, a whole foods high carbohydrate diet seems quite healthy.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I think it&#39;s a huge issue in this discussion space.  &#39;Carbohydrates&#39; is just too broad of a category to be lumping into a cogent discussion.  Skittles are not apples are not brown rice are not black beans are not, etc., etc.</p>

<p>No, insulin is a <a href="https://weightology.net/insulin-an-undeserved-bad-reputation/">growth hormone</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Carbs do not cause insulin resistance or carbohydrate intolerance, they do the opposite . Fat does however contribute to insulin resistance and carbohydrate intolerance. Why put a band aid over the symptoms instead of treating the underlying disease?</p>

<div class="md"><p>How is a different browser going to solve a network issue? Site is still down for me. </p>

<p>I’m not talking about fat, and lipotoxicity is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipotoxicity">not well understood.</a>. </p>

<p>Also this</p>

<p>My point is rather than worrying about fat, especially since you aren’t differentiating between any types of fat (yes, there are good fats that do not contribute to the metabolic syndrome), diabetics should be focusing on reducing carbs. </p>

<p>Insulin is <em>also</em> a growing hormone <em>and</em> a fat storing hormone. It is still triggered by carbs. Insulin resistance has a number of causes, and while you should stay away from bad fats, the main dietary cause will still be too many carbs.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>If someone becomes unable to safely metabolize carbohydrates as evidenced by high insulin and persistent high BG, then one solution is simply to stop eating them and let the body recover by using different metabolic pathways as primary.

<p>The real band aid approach is insulin and drugs to &quot;manage&quot; T2D and then call it progressive and degenerative as it in fact gets progressively worse and the person loses their kidney fxn, their eyesight, their feet.  Perhaps we agree there.</p>

<p>Carbohydrates are not essential.  The underlying disease is in metabolism of glucose.  You don&#39;t need to consume it and the body recovers when on a carbohydrate restricted diet, as shown by numerous studies and recent clinical trials (Virta).</p>

<p>Aka insulin resistance which can be fixed with high carb diets</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Show me those RCT studies and I will take these down too. You’ve obviously been blinded by something. This is a really strong statement and goes against everything cutting edge research is finding. </p>

<p>I already replied to you in the other thread regarding the positive long term effects on IR.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>High fat and ketogenic diets don’t let insulin sensitivity recover, they worsen it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Insulin sensitivity is irrelevant if you don&#39;t consume the macro requiring it.  Someone who is T2D has their overall level of insulin drop -- a good thing.  Someone who is T2D has their BG normalize -- a good thing.   These people are healthier.  They aren&#39;t damaging their body with high blood glucose. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>VIRTA has never shown a reversal of insulin resistance, only management  of symptoms. It shows increases in cholesterol levels which will  contribute to the #1 cause of death, heart disease</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again with the focus on useless metrics.  <em>It doesn&#39;t matter what your insulin resistance is if you don&#39;t eat carbohydrates!</em>  How is this still not obvious?</p>

<p>Virta and other studies of LCHF diets show, on average, lowering or no change to LDL.  Some people end up with higher LDL, higher HDL and lower trigs.  They would do well on a LCHF diet that minimizes cholesterol, sure.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>In Soviet Russia, it don&#39;t need to consume <strong>you</strong>!</p>

<div class="md"><p>First study:  in mice.</p>

<p>Second study: in mice.</p>

<p>Third study: FMD in response to glucose bolus after a LCHF diet for a week.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll ignore the mice studies.   A LCHF diet induces physiological glucose sparing.  To then challenge the body with glucose will obviously result in high BG and impact on FMD.</p>

<p>In the absence of doing something so unneeded and irrelevent, one can look at insulin levels and BG levels in people following a LCHF diet and the result is lowered insulin and stable BG levels.</p>

<p>The primary concern with &quot;insulin resistance&quot; is high blood glucose in response to consuming carbohydrates and the significant damage to the body (heart, eyes, brain, nerves, etc).  High insulin as a response to insulin resistance with carbohydrate in the diet has it&#39;s own set of damage.</p>

<p>If BG is low and stable, there is no concern regarding the sensitivity to insulin in the body.  Insulin is not being used to manage intake of glucose that has to then be cleared from the blood.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>First of all, thank you for providing these studies. I must admit I was somewhat passionate in previous my reactions, which might make me look a little biased. </p>

<p>There’s a lot to unpack here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2980360/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2980360/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The present study is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that KD induce severe hepatic insulin resistance in mice, as reflected by a significant impairment of insulin suppression of hepatic glucose production during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first, and maybe only study. I don’t think comparing humans to mice is a fair comparison. Especially ones for labs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It should be mentioned that the KD used in this study, as well as in other studies in mice (2–4, 25), may differ from KD used in humans. Indeed, this KD contains almost no carbohydrate and the protein proportion is low, whereas KD used in humans usually contain less fat, more protein, and also more carbohydrate. Also, in humans, low-carbohydrate diets usually result in decreased caloric intake (16, 30), which was not observed here and, thus, demonstrates the differences between humans and mice in the metabolic adaptations to such diets. However, these data clearly offer perspectives for research in dietary manipulations aimed at treating obesity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even the authors agree that mice and humans are different. But let’s just for a minute pretend for a minute that the same would happen in humans. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>After 1 wk of acclimatization, regular chow (RC; 2018S, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) was continued or the diet was changed to the KD (F3666, Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ) for 5 wk. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>5 weeks is not a therapeutic ketogenic diet. Also there is no mention what type of fat was in the chow; could have been extremely low quality vegetable oils.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30089335/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30089335/</a>
Not even gonna bother with this one. The title says it all:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Short-term feeding of a ketogenic diet induces more severe hepatic insulin resistance than an obesogenic high-fat diet.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/3/489">https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/3/489</a>
Again short term, not a low carb diet. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Short-Term Low-Carbohydrate High-Fat Diet in Healthy Young Males Renders the Endothelium Susceptible to Hyperglycemia-Induced Damage, An Exploratory Analysis</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also shocking the body that otherwise has &lt;7g of carbs with 75g kind of proves my point. </p>

<p>So letting mice binge feed on an unknown type of fat for a short while or carb-shocking humans who aren’t fat adapted yet causes insulin resistance. I’ll give you that one. </p>

<p>But the above is useless as it doesn’t show the long term therapeutic effects. If you give the body a chance to adapt, it lowers resistance.  Even the authors of the first study mention this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recent studies have suggested that KD may improve insulin sensitivity (8, 30, 37),</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(8’s title is <em>Long-term effects of a very-low-carbohydrate weight loss diet compared with an isocaloric low-fat diet after 12 mo.</em>)</p>

<p>This discussion also digresses from my original point. If you have insulin resistance, cut the carbs.</p>

<div class="md"><p>And you’re completely ignoring that they raise a causal factor in heart disease. Insulin has functions other than managing glucose. You are assuming this diet is safe in the long term without any evidence and dangerously recommending it to others.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yea because most humans are willing and able to never eat carbohydrates again. Who cares if they are insulin resistant, just feed them a diet that will raise their cholesterol levels and speed up atherosclerosis, heart disease is only the number one cause of death</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>You’re moving the goal posts</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, if eaten together with carbs. <strong>Show me a low carb study that causes insulin resistance. And by low carb I mean less than 50g of carbohydrates.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In these studies high fat low carb diets cause insulin resistance. If you have stronger evidence then provide it but as of now you are just assuming and speculating that a longer term study would show something different. We understand mechanisms behind insulin resistance, free fatty acids directly induce insulin resistance</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Of course a normal level of insulin, as happens when someone T2D follows LCHF, has other functions.   What&#39;s your point?  People can build muscle on keto so it&#39;s not like that function is in any way impaired.</p>

<p>There are 2 year studies showing keto is healthy, I am assuming nothing.  It is in no way &quot;dangerous&quot; to recommend keto.</p>

<p>What&#39;s dangerous to T2D, as shown in two large scale trials, is &quot;managing&quot; T2D by letting those people eat carbs and then aggressively giving them insulin and other drugs to manage their dangerously high BG.</p>

<p>In ketosis, T2D experience normalized BG and the best shown outcome for lowered HbA1c and you call that dangerous. Ridiculous.</p>

<p>IF someone sees raised LDL -- and you ignore that many people on LCHF see lowered LDL of course -- then adjusting the fat type can be helpful.  With the massive benefits demonstrated from a LCHF/keto diet, overall losing weight and having normalized BG (results are far better than found with very low fat/high whole carb diets, which I am able to accept are also useful I&#39;ll add), and since LDL is only associative with CVD relative risk factors, people with T2D should be informed of ALL choices.</p>

<p>The ADA has finally accepted low-carb as an option, btw.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>&quot;The LCKD [low CARB ketogenic diet] improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes such  that diabetes medications were discontinued or reduced in most  participants.

<p>But if you gave these people who lost bodyfat, lowered their trigs and BG, a giant freaking drink of pure glucose they will show as &quot;insulin resistant&quot;.  Who freaking cares.</p>

<p>What the real goal here?  Is it health?  Sure doesn&#39;t seem like it.</p>

<p>Oh and the people who GOT OFF T2D MEDS?  This was their diet &quot;Initially, participants were allowed unlimited amounts of meats,  poultry, fish, shellfish, and eggs; 2 cups of salad vegetables per day; 1  cup of low-carbohydrate vegetables per day; 4 ounces of hard cheese;  and limited amounts of cream, avocado, olives, and lemon juice.

</div>
<div class="md"><p>No, you moved them by claiming the best thing to do is stop eating fat. Stop eating carbs if you are diabetic, it will eventually improve your insulin sensitivity. Yes, it might increase insulin resistance in the shorter term, but since you aren’t eating a significant amount you don’t have to worry about that. In the long term, when the body adapts, you will be able to tolerate carbs better. I know I can a high carb meal without issues now, but don’t take it from my n=1:</p>

<p>They didn’t measure insulin sensitivity directly, they used a proxy measure which would be fine except for the fact that it’s never been validated in the context of a low carb study.

<p>High carb, very very low fat diets do not, in the studies done so far, have the reductions in FBG and HbA1c found with studies on keto.  They work, of course, but when HbA1c is still elevated the person is still at risk for all the deadly complications of T2D.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not at all false that LDL is only one factor of many in CVD.  T2D is a major factor and with LCHF the diebetic state is in remission -- NORMAL BG, why do you avoid acknowledging how significant this is?  What do you think caused that raised FMD in the study you cited?  It was high BG!  So any diet that keeps BG in the normal range, with of course also low trigs and high HDL, the LDL levels being normal is going to result in an overall lowered risk of CVD.   Meanwhile the kidneys, the eyes, the peripheral nerves are benefitting in a way that is not found with other dietary programs suggested for T2D.  That&#39;s why the ADA now endorses low-carb.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Why are you specifying “very very low fat”? I’ve only advocated for reducing saturated fat to very low levels, total fat up to 35% is fine. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not at all false that LDL is only one factor of many in CVD. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is the one prerequisite when reduced makes other factors irrelevant in regards to atherosclerosis. There are many things that cause endothelial dysfunction, including hyperglycemia, but with low levels of LDL you will not have atherosclerosis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NORMAL BG, why do you avoid acknowledging how significant this is?</p>

<p>Because you can achieve normal BG in other ways that won’t cause heart disease </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you think caused that raised FMD in the study you cited? It was high BG!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the high BG was because they were insulin resistant. You shouldn’t be hyperglycemic every time you eat carbs if you are healthy. Healthy humans don’t have to avoid an entire macronutrient </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Kempner reversed diabetic retinopathy using a diet of 90% carbs that included white rice, sugar, and juice. It’s overkill and unnecessary but it proves that limiting carbs is not necessary to reverse the underlying causes of diabetes. Trading diabetes for heart disease is foolish</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The best results with HbA1c and BG were keto.  It won&#39;t CAUSE heart disease either.  It&#39;s not a trade, its remission of T2D and insignificant relative risks for CVD (if that).  You know what is a high risk for CVD?  DIABETES.</p>

<p>Whats with you and Kempner?  The guy did some work in the 1950s, with poor methodology.  No one supports that diet 70 years later.  No one followed up with it in future research. I guess they didn&#39;t want to have to beat subjects like Kempner did.
There&#39;s no current research on it. He had a lot of anecdotes and scandals.  You take anecdotes and make these sweeping statements like it was statistically significant as a way of addressing retinopathy when it wasn&#39;t.  [Edit: I see, it was a diet of rice and limited fruit, so totally boring. People essentially fasted, from his own figures the caloric intake is hypocaloric.  It&#39;s not about rice and it&#39;s not about carbs, it&#39;s about fasting which we all know has significant benefits. Oh, and it had almost no salt.]</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If you have T2D you SHOULD NOT be eating the macro that results in retinopathy, and not having carbs means normal BG.  T2D are by definition NOT NORMAL, so obviously addressing their inability to manage carbohydrates is of high concern.</p>

<p>Your view of normal is also narrow and restricted.  Ketosis is normal, too.  It&#39;s normal for the body to make ketones. It&#39;s normal for the body to be in glucose sparing when it ketosis.  This is all normal.</p>

<p>If someone (without T2D) is in ketosis for a  month and then spends a week having whole food carbs, they&#39;ll pass that useless OGTT.  It&#39;s meaningless to someone in ketosis though.</p>

  'abstractNote': 'Context:\n'
                  'Consumption of high-fructose diets promotes hepatic fatty '
                  'acid synthesis (de novo lipogenesis [DNL]) and an '
                  'atherogenic lipid profile. It is unclear whether these '
                  'effects occur independent of positive energy balance and '
                  'weight gain.\n'
                  '\n'
                  'Objectives:\n'
                  'We compared the effects of a high-fructose, (25% of energy '
                  'content) weight-maintaining diet to those of an isocaloric '
                  'diet with the same macronutrient distribution but in which '
                  'complex carbohydrate (CCHO) was substituted for fructose.\n'
                  '\n'
                  'Design, Setting, and Participants:\n'
                  'Eight healthy men were studied as inpatients for '
                  'consecutive 9-day periods. Stable isotope tracers were used '
                  'to measure fractional hepatic DNL and endogenous glucose '
                  'production (EGP) and its suppression during a '
                  'euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Liver fat was measured '
                  'by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.\n'
                  '\n'
                  'Results:\n'
                  'Weight remained stable. Regardless of the order in which '
                  'the diets were fed, the high-fructose diet was associated '
                  'with both higher DNL (average, 18.6 ± 1.4% vs 11.0 ± 1.4% '
                  'for CCHO; P = .001) and higher liver fat (median, +137% of '
                  'CCHO; P = .016) in all participants. Fasting EGP and '
                  'insulin-mediated glucose disposal did not differ '
                  'significantly, but EGP during hyperinsulinemia was greater '
                  '(0.60 ± 0.07 vs 0.46 ± 0.06 mg/kg/min; P = .013) with the '
                  'high-fructose diet, suggesting blunted suppression of EGP.\n'
                  '\n'
                  'Conclusion:\n'
                  'Short-term high-fructose intake was associated with '
                  'increased DNL and liver fat in healthy men fed '
                  'weight-maintaining diets.',

The aim of this study was to explore the role of KD on liver and muscle insulin sensitivity, hepatic lipid metabolism, energy expenditure, and food intake. Using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, we studied insulin action in mice fed a KD or regular chow (RC). Body composition was assessed by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Hepatic insulin resistance could be attributed to a 350% increase in hepatic diacylglycerol content (P < 0.001), resulting in increased activation of PKCε (P < 0.05) and decreased insulin receptor substrate-2 tyrosine phosphorylation (P < 0.01).

The aim of this study was to explore the role of KD on liver and muscle insulin sensitivity, hepatic lipid metabolism, energy expenditure, and food intake. Using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, we studied insulin action in mice fed a KD or regular chow (RC). Body composition was assessed by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Despite being 15% lighter (P < 0.001) than RC-fed mice because of a 17% increase in energy expenditure (P < 0.001), KD-fed mice manifested severe hepatic insulin resistance, as reflected by decreased suppression (0% vs. 100% in RC-fed mice, P < 0.01) of endogenous glucose production during the clamp. Hepatic insulin resistance could be attributed to a 350% increase in hepatic diacylglycerol content (P < 0.001), resulting in increased activation of PKCε (P < 0.05) and decreased insulin receptor substrate-2 tyrosine phosphorylation (P < 0.01).

This decrease is associated with insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. This study was performed to evaluate the possible role of dietary factors in the glucose intolerance of aging. Two groups of men were studied: one young (Y; n = 8; age range, 18-36 yr) and one elderly (E; n = 10; age range, 65-82 yr). Frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance tests were performed in random order: 1) during ad libitum home dietary conditions; 2) after a 3- to 5-day regimen of very high (85%) carbohydrate intake; and 3) after a 3- to 5-day regimen of low (30%) carbohydrate intake (Y only). From the frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance test data, we calculated the glucose disappearance rate (Kg) and metabolic parameters according to the minimal model method, including the insulin sensitivity index (S1) and the first and second phase beta-cell responsivity to glucose (phi 1 and phi 2). The elderly men, while eating an ad libitum diet, were less tolerant to glucose than the young [mean Kg: E = 1.5 +/- 0.2% (+/- SE) min-1; Y = 2.3 +/- 0.3% min-1; P less than 0.025], had relative insulin resistance (mean Si: Y = 6.1 +/- 1.1; E = 2.4 +/- 0.7 min-1 10(-4)/(microU/mL) [0.85 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.33 +/- 0.10 min-1 10(-4)/(pmol/L)]; P less than 0.01), and lesser second phase beta-cell responsiveness to glucose (mean phi 2: Y = 18.5 +/- 3.6; E = 8.7 +/- 2.7 (microU/mL).min-2/(mg/dL) [2390 +/- 465 vs. 1120 +/- 349 (pmol/L).min-2/(mmol/L)]; P less than 0.05). A maximum improvement in Kg and S1 occurred at 41% carbohydrate feeding in the young men, whereas in the elderly men there was a significant increase in both of these parameters while eating the very high (85%) carbohydrate diet. Thus, the difference in glucose tolerance between groups was corrected by the very high carbohydrate diet (mean Kg: Y = 2.2 +/- 0.2%; E = 2.0 +/- 0.3%/min; P greater than 0.05), as was the age-related difference in insulin sensitivity (mean S1: Y = 5.6 +/- 1.2; E = 4.4 +/- 1.3 min-1 10(-4)/(microU/mL) [0.78 +/- 0.17 vs. 0.61 +/- 0.18 min-1 10(-4)/(pmol/L)]; P greater than 0.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","DOI":"10.1210/jcem-67-5-951","extra":"PMID: 3053750","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","shortTitle":"Insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in aging"}]

The LC diet may offer clinical benefits to obese persons with insulin resistance. However, the increase in LDL cholesterol with the LC diet suggests that this measure should be monitored.

<blockquote>
<p>This meta-analysis showed that <strong>moderate consumption of red/
white wine could effectively reduce the DBP and TC in T2DM
patients, but the SBP, glucose parameters and other lipid-associated measurements did not present significant differences</strong> in
these individuals. Although Koppes et al reported that alcohol
consumption is associated with a lower risk of mortality and coronary heart disease in type 2 diabetic population in their meta-analysis concerning observational studies,[18] we found different
results. To our best knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to
estimate the relationship between wine consumption with glucose
parameters and cardiovascular risk factors, by combining all
available randomized interventional trials up to date. Further
ROB evaluation, sensitivity, and publication bias tests provided
additional support for the robustness of our results. Although
heterogeneity is prevalent in the analysis, results from sensitivity
indicate that the overall effect size evaluations did not vary
substantially during exclusion of each study.</p>

<p>Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature
morbidity and mortality and its prevalence increased in DM.
People with hypertension and established cardiovascular diseases
are at particular high risk in general population.[19,20] Therefore,
the management of elevated BP is a critical component of the
comprehensive clinical management of diabetes. Previous study
had revealed that in well-controlled type 2 diabetic individuals
moderate red wine drinking could raise awake BP and lower
asleep BP.[15] <strong>Among our findings, the association between wine
intake and DBP reduction was significant, while the SBP showed
no significant differences in wine group and controls. Although
the present finding did not show significant decrease in SBP,
which is consistent with the general trend from various wine
consumption trials.[12,17] This inconsistency might be attributed
to the fact that we just pooled the average BP in our analysis, but the wine drinking affects BP differently between individual hours
across the 24-hours trajectory.[10] Owing to insufficient data we
could not do pooled analysis on BP changes based specific hours.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We observed no impact of wine on glycemic control by
monitoring FG, FI, and HbAc1% level.</strong> Some prior studies
reported the same results with ours, such as Napoli et al and Mori
et al who also did not found differences between wine group and
controls in FG, FI, and HbAc1%.[9,13] However, other organizations drew different conclusion by reporting that the level of FI
decreased after 1-year red wine intervention, otherwise no
significant differences were observed in FG, HbAc1%.[12,16] The
discrepancy could come from the differences in study participants, study design, the beverage type (red or white wine) and
approaches to measurement of insulin sensitivity.[15,21,22]</p>

<p>Individuals with T2DM have coexistent dyslipidemia characterized by increased TGs and reduced HDLC.[23,24] In contrast to
the well-documented effects of alcohol in healthy individuals to
increase HDL cholesterol. W<strong>e observed no changes in serum
HDL cholesterol with red wine relative to water or no drinking in
diabetic patients.</strong> In a multicenter randomized clinical intervention trial, diabetic subjects consuming red wine that diabetic
subjects consuming 13 g alcohol containing 13 g alcohol daily for
3 months showed no increase in HDL cholesterol and decrease in
LDL cholesterol and TG.[17] Whereas <strong>the level of TC was reduced
in diabetic subjects drinking wine in our meta-analysis.</strong> The likely
explanation for inconsistency among studies is related to the wine
dose or duration or to unique characteristics of the study
population.</p>

<p>From a physiologic perspective I can see why wine would improve blood pressure due to reductions in stress/anxiety but the total cholesterol reduction is a bit surprising.  Perhaps it&#39;s related to the polyphenols?  Or a substitution effect of wine replacing other dietary components that would have increased TC?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Could be a little of both, but I&#39;ve been doing a bit of drinking lately (for the first time in years) and it does replace some of the calories in my diet rather than adding more calories. There could be some benefit from replacing snacks in the diet with wine, which is essentially low-sugar fruit juice.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I remember exogenous polyphenols (or was it anti-oxidants... or resveratol? I&#39;m senile) not having a significant effect due to low bioavailability/absorption compared to endogenous production.</p>

<p>apart from the possible benefits however, is regular consumption of alcohol (as contained in red wine) not neurotoxic at all or liver-damaging at all?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is <strong>to determine the effectiveness of probiotic supplementation on clinical symptoms, weight loss, glycemic control, lipid and hormonal profiles, and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).</strong> Eligible studies were systematically searched from Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, and Web of Science databases until January 2019. Cochran (Q) and I-square statistics were used to measure heterogeneity among included studies. Data were pooled by using random-effect model and expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Eleven articles were included in this meta-analysis. Probiotic supplementation significantly decreased weight (SMD - 0.30; 95% CI, - 0.53, - 0.07; P = 0.01), body mass index (BMI) (SMD - 0.29; 95% CI, - 0.54, - 0.03; P = 0.02), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (SMD - 0.26; 95% CI, - 0.45, - 0.07; P &lt; 0.001), insulin (SMD - 0.52; 95% CI, - 0.81, - 0.24; P &lt; 0.001), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (SMD - 0.53; 95% CI, - 0.79, - 0.26; P &lt; 0.001), triglycerides (SMD - 0.69; 95% CI, - 0.99, - 0.39; P &lt; 0.001), VLDL-cholesterol (SMD - 0.69; 95% CI, - 0.99, - 0.39; P &lt; 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (SMD - 1.26; 95% CI, - 2.14, - 0.37; P &lt; 0.001), malondialdehyde (MDA) (SMD - 0.90; 95% CI, - 1.16, - 0.63; P &lt; 0.001), hirsutism (SMD - 0.58; 95% CI, - 1.01, - 0.16; P &lt; 0.001), and total testosterone levels (SMD - 0.58; 95% CI, - 0.82, - 0.34; P &lt; 0.001), and also increased the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (SMD 0.41; 95% CI, 0.11, 0.70; P &lt; 0.01), nitric oxide (NO) (SMD 0.33; 95% CI 0.08, 0.59; P = 0.01), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (SMD 0.64; 95% CI, 0.38, 0.90; P &lt; 0.001), glutathione (GSH) (SMD 0.26; 95% CI, 0.01, 0.52; P = 0.04), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels (SMD 0.46; 95% CI, 0.08, 0.85; P = 0.01). <strong>Probiotic supplementation may result in an improvement in weight, BMI, FPG, insulin, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, VLDL-cholesterol, CRP, MDA, hirsutism, total testosterone, QUICKI, NO, TAC, GSH, and SHBG but did not affect dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels, and total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol levels in patients with PCOS.</strong></p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be curious to see the specific list of microorganisms used in this study, and how they were supplemented.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a review of numerous studies, so it differed from study to study. </p>

<p>See table 1 in the link above.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks.  No conflicts were declared which was my big concern after seeing such positive results.  And thanks for crossposting to <a href="/r/HumanMicrobiome">/r/HumanMicrobiome</a>.  I noticed you haven&#39;t made any comments about it but you are usually quite talkative about microbiome papers.  Nothing caught your fancy?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What I noticed is how different each intervention was. They included prebiotics and many different probiotics. </p>

<p>So the main conclusion is that modulating the gut microbiome has the potential to help PCOS, which isn&#39;t surprising. </p>

<p>What this fails to do is tell us what the best microbiome modulation for PCOS is.</p>

<p>I crossposted to <a href="/r/PCOS">/r/PCOS</a> too.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I suppose I was more surprised that benefits were found across such a wide range of probiotics when it was my (limited) understanding that most probiotics are junk.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m not good with numbers, so how big a difference each intervention made, as seen in table 2, isn&#39;t clear to me. </p>

<p>If each intervention had significant benefits you could draw a variety of different hypotheses, such as these interventions are disrupting pathogens that are the cause of the PCOS. Diet isn&#39;t mentioned either, so maybe the patients&#39; diets were poor, resulting in dysbiosis, which these interventions partially disrupted or suppressed problematic microbes that were being fed by the poor diet. Not too sure. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not necessarily that &quot;most probiotics are junk&quot;, but rather, they&#39;re not ideal (compared to the microbes in breast milk or FMT) and seem to have similar mechanisms which aren&#39;t universally helpful, but in this case seemed to be more beneficial than not. Though there is <strong>no mention of adverse events</strong>.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing a lot of study on insulin resistance recently, and I thought it would be interesting to have a discussion about various aspects of insulin resistance. The aspects I&#39;ve thought of are:</p>

<ul>
<li>How is insulin resistance determined?</li>
<li>What is mechanistically going on in insulin resistance?</li>
<li>What is the cause of that behavior?</li>
<li>How is it best treated?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are likely other interesting parts to discuss...</p>

<p>My plan is to do a short post that summarizes *my* understanding of an area, and then others can comment on whether that agrees with their understanding.</p>

<p>****</p>

<p><strong>How is insulin resistance determined?</strong></p>

<p>Elevated <strong>Fasting Blood Glucose</strong> was one common way of diagnosing insulin resistance; a normal fasting blood glucose is considered to be less than 100 mg/dl. If after fasting overnight you have an elevated fasting blood glucose, you very likely have insulin resistance and type II diabetes.</p>

<p>Because fasting blood glucose is after an overnight fast, it is not necessarily definitive enough; somebody could have elevated blood glucose for much of the day but normal blood glucose after the overnight fast. There are two other measurements that are considered to be better.</p>

<p>The first is a blood measurement known as <strong>HbA1c</strong>. In simple terms, the hemoglobin in red blood cells is modified by glucose molecules (&quot;glycated&quot;), and the amount that this happens depends on the concentration of glucose in the blood. HbA1c is therefore a rough measure of the average glucose levels in the blood over the life of red blood cells, approximately 8-12 weeks. HbA1c is a pretty good measure overall but in some cases it can give a false negative - it may return a normal result for a patient who is actually insulin resistant. </p>

<p>The second measurement is the <strong>Oral Glucose Tolerance Test</strong> (<strong>OGT</strong> or <strong>OGTT</strong>). In this test, the patient is given 75 grams of glucose after an overnight fast and their blood glucose levels are measured every 20 or 30 minutes for a period of a few hours. Generally speaking, normal patients see a small glucose spike that rapidly returns to normal while very insulin resistant patients see high blood glucose levels for hours. There&#39;s a decent overall guide <a href="https://laboratoryinfo.com/glucose-tolerance-test-gtt-principle-procedure-indications-interpretation/">here</a> that shows the different responses that are seen and explains more about the test.</p>

<p>OGTT is considered to be the gold standard for insulin resistance, but like blood glucose, it is looking at the response after a fast when a person is best equipped to deal with a big chunk of dietary glucose. There have been some recent studies using continuous glucose monitoring on &quot;normal&quot; patients which found large blood glucose spikes - into the diabetic range - after meals.</p>

<p>It is fair to say that there is a wide spectrum of insulin resistance; there are people who are very diabetic and very insulin resistant, and those who are only slightly insulin resistant.</p>

<p>I think this article gives a good discussion about insulin resistance.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Like most metabolic processes in our bodies, there isn&#39;t a binary switch that signals insulin resistant versus not. People gradually lose their insulin sensitivity over decades until they start being symptomatic.</p>

<p>Relevant - the whole Virta not really &quot;reversing&quot; diabetes controversy boils down to whether or not their low-cab diet is useful in improving insulin sensitivity, or if it simply controls blood glucose levels. Those who oppose Virta&#39;s use of the term &quot;reversal&quot; argue that true reversal means an actual reversal of insulin resistance, not simply a reduction/stabilization of blood glucose levels.</p>

<p><strong>Hyperinsulinemic syndrome: the metabolic syndrome is broader than you think.</strong></p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by hyperinsulinemia. In 2011 we showed that gastric bypass (RYGB) corrects these high levels even though insulin resistance remains high, ie, the operation &quot;dissociates&quot; hyperinsulinemia from insulin resistance. RYGB produces reversal of T2DM along with other diseases associated with the metabolic syndrome. This observation led us to examine whether these illnesses also were characterized by hyperinsulinemia.</p>

<p>METHODS:</p>

<p>A systematic review was performed to determine whether hyperinsulinemia was present in disorders associated with the metabolic syndrome. We reviewed 423 publications. 58 were selected because of appropriate documentation of insulin measurements. Comparisons were based on whether the studies reported patients as having increased versus normal insulin levels for each metabolic disorder.</p>

<p>RESULTS:</p>

<p>The presence (+) or absence (-) of hyperinsulinemia was documented in these articles as follows: central obesity (4+ vs 0-), diabetes (5+ vs 0-), hypertension (9+ vs 1-), dyslipidemia (2+ vs 0-), renal failure (4+ vs 0-), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (5+ vs 0-), polycystic ovary syndrome (7+ vs 1-), sleep apnea (7+ vs 0-), certain cancers (4+ vs 1-), atherosclerosis (4+ vs 0-), and cardiovascular disease (8+ vs 0-). Four articles examined insulin levels in the metabolic syndrome as a whole (4+ vs 0-).</p>

<p>CONCLUSION:</p>

<p>These data document that disorders linked to the metabolic syndrome are associated with high levels of insulin, suggesting that these diseases share a common etiology that is expressed by high levels of insulin. This leads us to propose the concept of a &quot;hyperinsulinemic syndrome&quot; and question the safety of insulin as a chronic therapy for patients with T2DM.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I was hoping this was going to be a discussion on insulin sensitivity.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>For testing, I think most people who get their fasting glucose measured (standard with a CMP) should also get a fasting insulin assay done (its a $30 test, but it&#39;s rarely given) as it will reveal developing insulin resistance much earlier than FBG or A1c alone will. You also can&#39;t calculate HOMA-IR(2) or QUICKI insulin resistance estimates without it!</p>

<p>One of the reasons A1c isn&#39;t always accurate btw is because it&#39;s dependent on RBC turnover. Fructosamine is a good test to use in the cases where you&#39;re getting discordant A1c&#39;s.</p>

<p>LP-IR (generated via lipid subfractionation, like with an NMR) is also a good estimator, although the single best/easiest marker for metabolic health is probably waist circumference ratio.</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>After reading the first part i assumed you were gonna answer all the questions you&#39;ve put up there, but it was still interesting to know how it&#39;s determined.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is it best treated? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as i know it&#39;s basically done by lowering body&#39;s exposure to insulin. Changing the diet so you eat foods that don&#39;t spike insulin, exercising and fasting.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Weightology also has a great 5-part article series called <a href="https://weightology.net/insulin-an-undeserved-bad-reputation/">Insulin: An Undeserved Bad Reputation</a>.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting point; I&#39;m planning on touching on it in the post 4 about treatment.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>T2D is a disease of hyperinsulinemia as much as insulin resistance.</p>

<p>Low-carb/ketosis and fasting (exercise to some degree) will reverse hyperinsulinemia and as such are valid treatments.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m a little put off by your comment of &quot;simply controls blood glucose levels&quot; since BG levels are responsible for the damage of T2D.  Feels a little dismissive of limb loss, kidney damage, vision loss, etc.  Controlling BG is a huge benefit of ketogenic diets.  Fasting (which is ketogenic and restricts carbs during the fast) also helps restore BG levels by reducing insulin.</p>

<p>The issue with defining remission of T2D as lack of insulin resistance is that in ketosis, one is physiologically glucose sparing. Using FBG and insulin levels seems more useful in that context. </p>

<p>I guess it depends on the goal here in terms of the patient&#39;s health.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Insulin sensitivity is the inverse of insulin resistance; if you are are not insulin resistant, you are insulin sensitive.</p>

<p>Is there something you specifically want to know or discuss?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thanks - good info.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>This makes sense at a glance, but hasn&#39;t proven out in practice. Low-carb diets, for example, work wonderfully to control glucose and reduce insulin exposure but don&#39;t do much to improve actual insulin sensitivity.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What I learned from reading this article that I found interesting is that glucagon doesn&#39;t stimulate lipolysis in humans. That&#39;s a common misnomer in the keto community.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Hyperinsulinemia driven by insulin resistance. Meaning if the latter improves, so will the former. The inverse can&#39;t be said though, which is the gist of the controversy. Symptoms vs causes.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t mean to dismiss control of blood glucose. I believe it&#39;s always prudent to target that as an initial step in treating T2D.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious how different mechanisms work to improve it, in athletes, how it aids in glycogen restoration, or other situations. It&#39;s a concept I only just learned exists, so I&#39;ve been reading and bookmarking over the last few days.  </p>

<p>Nothing specific I suppose, it&#39;s just a very interesting concept.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Two major large scale studies looking at simple control of BG with more insulin/T2D drugs increases all cause mortality.  High BG response to glucose and high FBS are the symptom not the cause.</p>

<p>You can resolve hyperinsulinemia with ketosis or fasting.  This resolves BG issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Hmm. I wrote this a while back as part of a series for my cycling friends; it has some background on glucose storage and blood glucose regulation that&#39;s important...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.riderx.info/the-endurance-athletes-guide-to-fueling-and-weight-loss-part-1-fat-and-carbohydrate-intake-and-storage/">http://www.riderx.info/the-endurance-athletes-guide-to-fueling-and-weight-loss-part-1-fat-and-carbohydrate-intake-and-storage/</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>No disagreements there. The controversy is more around hyperinsulinemia/hyperglycemia vs insulin resistance (root cause) and whether or not one can claim they reversed diabetes if the root cause hasn&#39;t been addressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I see.  Even metabolically healthy people go into physiological glucose sparing when in ketosis and then return to normal insulin sensitivity when returning to consuming carbs.</p>

<p>So then, how can you tell if a T2D would return to normal insulin sensitivity (that they had before being T2D), after ketosis normalizes their T2D symptoms but they are in the same physiological glucose sparing as a healthy person would be?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s been shown if you break your metabolism, it can recover.  Remission (vs progressive/degenerative/there go your feet) might be the best we can do.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>There was a metabolic ward study posted here recently where subjects with diabetes were able to reduce (some even discontinue) their insulin dosage and improve glycemic control all while eating a diet very high in fiber, carbs, and low in fat. That implies an improvement in insulin sensitivity, since they were eating a large amount of carbohydrates while improving.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yes, a whole foods diet high in whole carbohydrate had some positive effect for T2D (You might have recalled this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bu8lz0/highcarbohydrate_highfiber_diets_for/">old study posted recently</a>.    They were lean, which is notable, and also &quot;The average </p>

<p>insulin dose was reduced from 26 ± 3 units/day (mean ± SEM) on the control diets to 11 ± 3 (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.001) on the HCF diets.</p>

<p>[Noted elsewhere &quot;On the HCF diets, insulin therapy could be discontinued in nine patients  receiving 15 to 20 units/day and in two patients receiving 32  units/day.&quot;]</p>

<p>Fasting and 3-hr postprandial plasma glucose values were lower in <strong>most</strong>  patients on the HCF diets than on the control diets despite lower  insulin doses.  [Fasting glucose never got below 100 -- this includes subjects where insulin was discontinued.]</p>

<p>Serum cholesterol values dropped from 206 ± 10 mg/dl on  the control diets to 147 ± 5 (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.001) on the HCF diet; </p>

<p>average fasting serum triglyceride values were not significantly altered on the HCF diets.&quot;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Ketosis though, at one year [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13300-018-0373-9">Virta Health</a>]</p>

<p>Insulin therapy was reduced or eliminated in 94% of users; sul-fonylureas were entirely eliminated in the CCI.  No adverse events were attributed to the CCI.  Additional CCI 1-year effects were </p>

<p>HOMA-IR -55% (P=3.2910-5), </p>

<p>hsCRP -39% (P\1.0910-16), </p>

<p>triglycerides -24% (P\1.0910-16), </p>

<p>HDL-cholesterol +18% (P\1.0910-16), and </p>

<p>LDL-cholesterol +10% (P=5.1910-5); </p>

<p>serum creatinine and liver enzymes (ALT, AST, andALP) declined (PB0.0001), and </p>

<p>apolipoproteinB was unchanged (P=0.37). </p>

<p>[From elsewhere in the paper -- HbA1c declined from 59.6 ± 1.0 to 45.2 ± 0.8 mmol mol−1 (7.6 ± 0.09% <em>to 6.3</em> ± 0.07%, <em>P</em> &lt; 1.0 × 10−16) -- __7.6% decline in HbA1c__]</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>There have been recent papers looking at a whole foods high carb diet (&quot;WFPB&quot;) for T2D (where people were obese, as just about everyone with T2D is). I think there was one more recent than this but the results were similar.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16873779">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16873779</a></p>

<p>&quot;Forty-three percent (21 of 49) of the vegan group and 26% (13 of 50) of  the ADA group participants reduced diabetes medications. </p>

<p>Including all  participants, HbA(1c) (A1C) decreased 0.96 percentage points in the  vegan group and 0.56 points in the ADA group (P = 0.089). </p>

<p>LDL cholesterol fell 21.2% in the vegan group and 10.7% in  the ADA group (P = 0.02).</p>

<p>[From elsewhere -- In a 12-week pilot trial of a low-fat vegan diet in individuals with  type 2 diabetes, conducted without increased exercise, fasting serum  glucose concentration dropped 28%] &quot;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Weight loss is a confounder in both of the more current studies, since in the one from 1975 all subjects were lean.</p>

<p>Ketosis has showed the best reduction so far in HbA1c and fasting blood glucose.</p>

<p>tl;dr yes, whole food high carb/low fat diets do show improvements in markers associated with insulin sensitivity.  The patients would have improved far more, on average, in ketosis, regardless of any physiological glucose sparing as part of being in ketosis.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The thing about reducing insulin on ketogenic diets is that it&#39;s expected, since they&#39;re eating a very low carb diet. Specially after one year on a VLCD. If you&#39;re barely eating carbs, it&#39;s no surprise you won&#39;t be spiking your glucose all the time. This still isn&#39;t saying much about insulin resistance (the root cause of T2D, hyperinsulinemia/glycemia, etc), hence the controversy surrounding Virta and their claim of diabetes reversal, rather than &quot;control&quot; or &quot;management.&quot; Not to mention the weight loss confounder.</p>

<p>The study I talk about isn&#39;t even WFPB if I recall correctly. Just high carb, high fiber, low fat. Notable differences are the stable weight and the improvement in glycemic control <em>while eating lots of carbs</em>. That&#39;s the interesting bit that might hint at actual insulin resistance reversal. Moreover it was only 16 days. More data is definitely needed to make any conclusions, but existing data seems to show that diets high in carbs and very low in fats show promise at actually reversing insulin resistance.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Ok but again that study the men were <em>lean</em> and had T2D so it wasn&#39;t related to visceral fat etc.  I don&#39;t think it is applicable to the current T2D situation.  Some did reduce insulin but their FBG was still all 100+ and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s ideal.</p>

<p>As the results with a high whole foods carb, low fat diet has only moderate effects, and a very small reduction in HbA1c, I don&#39;t see it as helpful for reversing insulin resistance or helping the patient avoid complications of their still high BG and still high HbA1c.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This still isn&#39;t saying much about insulin resistance (the root cause of T2D, hyperinsulinemia/glycemia, etc), hence the controversy surrounding Virta and their claim of diabetes reversal, rather than &quot;control&quot; or &quot;management.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are very careful to use remission, which is accurate.  The patients have the best results in terms of eliminating insulin use, <em>lowering insulin levels in the body</em> and HbA1c.  In terms of clinical outcomes, it&#39;s better.</p>

<p>I see your point they are tolerating whole food carbohydrates on a LFH(W)C diet.  Before though they weren&#39;t eating whole food carbohydrates though, they were eating bread and pasta and soda and chips and crap.  So just eating better definitely helps, but it doesn&#39;t help as much as going into ketosis.</p>

<p>What we need to see is if after 2 years of ketosis, no T2D medication, all normal biomarkers, if those people can then consume a whole foods diet (that includes fat and animal products) and see no return of insulin resistance.  Until that study is done, the best clinical outcomes once someone eats themselves into T2D is going to be LCHF, regardless of if the patient has the same base insulin resistance they had while T2D.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Well the study was only 16 days, so I don&#39;t think we can conclude whether or not that diet is effective just yet. The way I see it, an improvement in glucose control (yes, still high, but c&#39;mon just 16 days <em>and</em>  still eating carbs) while eating a diet composed of 70% carbs is quite promising and hints at the possibility of insulin resistance reversal.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Current studies looking at a similar diet with obese T2D don&#39;t see that result.  70% carbs is largely whole foods, tons of fiber.  I think that&#39;s why insulin does lower and you see a minimal improvement in BG (which again remained over 100 as FBG, I don&#39;t know what the ranges accepted were in the 70s but that seemed high to me).</p>

<p>I find it neat that a low-fat diet like that results in the body scavenging fat from the liver and other visceral fat but a high fat diet also results in the body catabolizing that fat!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>For such a short study, rather than critique the FBG after 16 days, it makes more sense to see the direction the subjects were going in, improvement in glucose control + insulin reduction + all while eating lots of carbs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware LCHF diets are excellent at controlling hyperglycemia from the get-go, that&#39;s definitely a strength they have. What hasn&#39;t been shown is whether or not they&#39;re effective at improving insulin resistance.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Again those men were lean with T2D which is unusual and almost everyone with T2D nowadays is overweight or obese.  There have been far more current studies looking at a low-fat/high-carb diet, some for as long as a year.
There are some improvements in BG and in HbA1c but they are very small changes.  They didn&#39;t look at that metric back in the 70s so we don&#39;t know if there was improvement.</p>

<p>There needs to be a test for insulin resistance that can take into account physiological glucose sparing, and I think those sorts of studies won&#39;t happen until we have a large enough group of people who had T2D and put it into remission, where we can look at their response to switching to a low-fat/whole food high carb diet for 6 weeks or something.</p>

<p>Basically I expect anyone metabolically normal to handle a HWCLF diet just fine, in terms of FBG, etc.  Also anyone metabolically normal who goes into ketosis, can transition out of it to a HWHLF diet.</p>

<p>I stick that W in because a high refined carb diet is how people get T2D!</p>

Therefore, we assessed the effectiveness and safety of a novel care model providing continuous remote care with medication management based on biometric feedback combined with the metabolic approach of nutritional ketosis for T2D management.MethodsWe conducted an open-label, non-randomized, controlled, before-and-after 1-year study of this continuous care intervention (CCI) and usual care (UC). Primary outcomes were glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), weight, and medication use. Secondary outcomes included fasting serum glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, blood lipids and lipoproteins, liver and kidney function markers, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).Results349 adults with T2D enrolled: CCI: n = 262 [mean (SD); 54 (8) years, 116.5 (25.9) kg, 40.4 (8.8) kg m2, 92% obese, 88% prescribed T2D medication]; UC: n = 87 (52 (10) years, 105.6 (22.15) kg, 36.72 (7.26) kg m2, 82% obese, 87% prescribed T2D medication]. 218 participants (83%) remained enrolled in the CCI at 1 year. Intention-to-treat analysis of the CCI (mean ± SE) revealed HbA1c declined from 59.6 ± 1.0 to 45.2 ± 0.8 mmol mol−1 (7.6 ± 0.09% to 6.3 ± 0.07%, P < 1.0 × 10−16), weight declined 13.8 ± 0.71 kg (P < 1.0 × 10−16), and T2D medication prescription other than metformin declined from 56.9 ± 3.1% to 29.7 ± 3.0% (P < 1.0 × 10−16). Insulin therapy was reduced or eliminated in 94% of users; sulfonylureas were entirely eliminated in the CCI. No adverse events were attributed to the CCI.

UC participants had no significant changes in biomarkers or T2D medication prescription at 1 year.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that a novel metabolic and continuous remote care model can support adults with T2D to safely improve HbA1c, weight, and other biomarkers while reducing diabetes medication use.ClinicalTrials.gov IdentifierNCT02519309.FundingVirta Health Corp., Plain Language SummaryTreatments for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have improved, yet T2D and being overweight are still significant public health concerns. Blood sugar in patients with T2D can improve quickly when patients eat significantly fewer dietary carbohydrates. However, this demands careful medicine management by doctors, and patients need support and frequent contact with health providers to sustain this way of living. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a new care model with very low dietary carbohydrate intake and continuous supervision by a health coach and doctor could safely lower HbA1c, weight and need for medicines after 1 year in adults with T2D. 262 adults with T2D volunteered to participate in this continuous care intervention (CCI) along with 87 adults with T2D receiving usual care (UC) from their doctors and diabetes education program. After 1 year, patients in the CCI, on average, lowered HbA1c from 7.6 to 6.3%, lost 12% of their body weight, and reduced diabetes medicine use. 94% of patients who were prescribed insulin reduced or stopped their insulin use, and sulfonylureas were eliminated in all patients. Participants in the UC group had no changes to HbA1c, weight or diabetes medicine use over the year. These changes in CCI participants happened safely while dyslipidemia and markers of inflammation and liver function improved. This suggests the novel care model studied here using dietary carbohydrate restriction and continuous remote care can safely support adults with T2D to lower HbA1c, weight, and medicine use.","ISSN":"1869-6961","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13300-018-0373-9","DOI":"10.1007/s13300-018-0373-9","publicationTitle":"Diabetes Therapy","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Springer Link","accessDate":"2019-07-02T20:40:14Z","shortTitle":"Effectiveness and Safety of a Novel Care Model for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes at 1 Year"}]

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Edit: Should be &quot;part 2&quot;...</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bz2puc/discussion_insulin_resistance_part_1_how_is/">Part 1: How is insulin resistance determined?</a></p>

<p>To understand what is going wrong mechanistically with insulin resistance, we need to understand how blood glucose regulation works. The following is a very brief overview and is of course simplified because biochemistry is very complex.</p>

<p><strong>Blood glucose regulation</strong></p>

<p>The pancreas is in charge of tracking blood glucose levels and keeping them regulated, and it does this through two messenger hormones; insulin and glucagon. In simple terms, insulin is the signal that there is too much glucose and glucagon is the signal that there is not enough glucose.</p>

<p>If blood glucose is <strong>low</strong>, the glucagon has two effects.</p>

<ul>
<li>It moves the body towards burning more fat and fewer carbs (because carbs are rare).</li>
<li>It messages the liver to release glucose to bring the blood glucose back to normal. The liver has two ways of doing this; it can convert stored glycogen back to glucose (glycogenolysis) or it can create glucose from compounds such as lactate, glycerol, or most animo acids (gluconeogenesis). It starts mostly using stored glycogen and transitions to mostly creating glucose as time goes on. Here&#39;s a <a href="http://fblt.cz/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Kapitola-09-07-ENG-03.jpg">nice chart</a> that shows timing.</li>
</ul>

<p>The liver is solely in charge of increasing glucose. That will be important later.</p>

<p>If blood glucose is <strong>high</strong>, the insulin has wider-ranging effects:</p>

<ul>
<li>It moves the body toward burning carbs and not fat.</li>
<li>It messages the muscles to take up extra glucose and store it as glycogen (this is limited by the glycogen storage capacity of the muscles)</li>
<li>It messages the liver to take up extra glucose and store it as glycogen (also limited by the glycogen storage capacity of the liver).</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are what I call the first-level effects; they happen with small amounts of insulin and the conversion of glucose to glycogen (glycogenesis) is quick, so it can absorb glucose quickly.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s not enough room for the glucose to be stored as glycogen, more insulin is secreted and we see what I call the second-level effects:</p>

<ul>
<li>The liver takes in glucose and converts it to fat.</li>
<li>The fat tissues takes in glucose and converts it to fat.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is known as &quot;de novo lipogenesis&quot; (&quot;new fat creation&quot;). It&#39;s fairly slow, so blood glucose will be elevated for a longer period of time in this scenario.</p>

<p><strong>Insulin Resistance mechanisms</strong></p>

<p>To recap from post 1, in insulin resistance we see elevated blood glucose after fasting and very high blood glucose after drinking 75 grams of glucose. I&#39;d like to talk about those separately.</p>

<p>The mechanism for elevated blood glucose is especially interesting and - I think - not understood by many people. These people have significantly elevated blood glucose after a 12 hour fast. That&#39;s long after they are getting glucose from their last meal, so something is going on with their glucose regulation machinery; they were able to go from a very high level after eating to a level that is only moderately elevated, so their body has the ability to either store or burn off a fair bit of glucose.</p>

<p>But they now appear to be stuck. They can&#39;t get from 144 mg/dl of glucose down to 80 mg/dl.</p>

<p>It&#39;s useful to look at that in terms of absolute quantities. People have around 50 dl of blood in their bodies, so at 144 mg/dl that would be 144 * 50 = 7200 mg = 7 grams of glucose. 80 mg/dl is 80 * 50 = 4000 mg = 4 grams of glucose. So the excess is a measly three grams of glucose. It would seem that they should easily be able to store or burn off that much glucose...</p>

<p>And they could. Which means that the problem is not related to glucose removal, it&#39;s related to glucose supply.</p>

<p>Remembering back to who is responsible for increasing blood glucose when it&#39;s low, the finger points directly at the liver. The reason that insulin resistant people have elevated fasting glucose is because their liver is not correctly responding to the insulin in the blood that would normally keep the liver from releasing glucose; the liver is releasing glucose <strong>all the time</strong>. And that constant stream of glucose means a constant stream of insulin, or hyperinsulinemia.</p>

<p>This excess glucose could either come from stored glycogen or gluconeogenesis. I think the research points much more strongly at gluconeogenesis being the problem. That makes more sense mechanistically as gluconeogenesis is the only non-dietary way to bring new glucose into the bloodstream.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the first malfunction in insulin resistance, and is often overlooked. The second discussion is the response after a &quot;glucose challenge&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read a bunch of the research about the lack of response to elevated glucose, and from my perspective there is not a consensus around what is going on, but a few things seem likely:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is well established that the size of the blood glucose and insulin response you see in people depends on the state of their glycogen stores. Feed an insulin sensitive person 75 grams of glucose after an overnight fast, and most of that is going to go straight into their glycogen stores. Take that same person and give them another 75 grams of glucose a few hours later, and the blood glucose and insulin response will be very different as their glycogen stores will be full. Given that insulin resistant people have excess glucose all the time, it is likely that their glycogen stores are full even when fasted and that is one of the reason their response is so poor. I haven&#39;t found any research on this, and would love to see any that exists.</li>
<li>There is something that is slowing down the uptake of glucose from the blood into the adipose cells (and perhaps muscle cells as well), and that also contributes to how long the blood glucose is elevated.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next post will be about the cause of both of these mechanistic malfunctions.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks for your post. My daughter has insulin resistance and she has been doing a mostly carnivore diet that has resulted in a 40 pound weight loss. I am taking her back to the doctor next week and am interested to see if her insulin resistance will change with the weight loss. Keep the information coming!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It is well established that the size of the blood glucose and insulin  response you see in people depends on the state of their glycogen  stores. Feed an insulin sensitive person 75 grams of glucose after an  overnight fast, and most of that is going to go straight into their  glycogen stores. Take that same person and give them another 75 grams of  glucose a few hours later, and the blood glucose and insulin response  will be very different as their glycogen stores will be full. Given that  insulin resistant people have excess glucose all the time, it is likely  that their glycogen stores are full even when fasted and that is one of  the reason their response is so poor. I haven&#39;t found any research on  this, and would love to see any that exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a super interesting observation.</p>

<p>From your other comments, the persistence of dawn phenomena in both keto and fasting would agree with the view that liver disregulation of GNG is a factor.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Sanpaku this is a great post with lots of sources. Definitely opened my eyes..what is the optimal diet for reducing insulin resistance?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Your major studies rely on overweight individuals, eating a SAD, who are over fed a certain type of fat.</p>

<p>This is not keto, this is not carnivore, that is abuse and mixing two different fuel sources together that shouldn&#39;t be mixed in the first place.</p>

<p>Your information is pushing for poor results, if you had studies proving SFA was bad while in the FULL ABSENCE OF CARBS I would be very inclined to believe you but it isn&#39;t so I&#39;m not.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I would be very surprised if it had not improved.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>One more comment on this. </p>

<p>Her markers on IR will probably be much better. If you take somebody on a carnivore or other VLC diet and give them an OGTT test, they will fail. This isn&#39;t because they are still insulin resistant; it&#39;s because their pancreas is in hibernation and cannot produce the amount of insulin required to deal with a big chunk of carbs. </p>

<p>OGTT test instructions typically recommend that the person eat a &quot;normal&quot; amount of carbs (not sure what that really means, but it means enough to require a decent amount of insulin) for a few days before the test.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>How is the doctor planning to evaluate her insulin resistance?</p>

<p>Congrats to her on the weight loss!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Just be aware that carnivore diet is not necessarily ketogenic; so people can overeat on protein (in relation to fat) leading to excess protein being converted to glucose for energy. <a href="/r/PaleolithicKetogenic">r/PaleolithicKetogenic</a> is basically the ketogenic subset of the carnivore diet.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What if I have been doing a high-fat ketogenic diet in place of an overnight fast? Where would the ingested glucose go?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Probably a diet that in total calories is hypocaloric (weight loss always improves insulin resistance) with macronutrients very low in saturated fat, low or &quot;incomplete&quot; in protein (fibroblast growth factor-21 responds to protein inadequacies and improves insulin sensitivity). The bulk of calories should come from low glycemic index starches and/or unsaturated fats. Fermentable fiber would help on the microbiome/inflammation side. There&#39;s a 85 year history of insulin resistance and early stage T2 diabetes being successfully treated with this sort of diet.</p>

<p>There is an appeal to the other end of the macronutrient balance. We all like high-fat/high-protein foods, so it doesn&#39;t take much rationalization justify these. High protein is useful for reducing appetite, and the absence of carbs will reduce measures like  HbA1c. However, absent weight loss, insulin resistance remains high, and all the lipotoxic ER stress is still occurring in pancreatic beta cells. Seems a good way to turn oneself into an asymptomatic diabetic.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>This will be a very interesting part of the discussion that I&#39;m hoping will happen on the next post after</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>How about this one? Even just changing the type of fat changes a person’s insulin sensitivity:

</div>
<div class="md"><p>Likely straight into glycogen storage in the liver/muscle as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>If you&#39;ve been doing it consistently, it probably won&#39;t go anywhere as the pancreas will reduce its ability to generate insulin if it isn&#39;t needed for an extended period of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What your top ten articles or methods for reducing insulin resistance if I may ask?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Seems like your own the other guys boat too. </p>

<p>This is not a study with the absence of carbs, this looks to be a non ketogenic study.</p>

<p>I never argued SFA with carbs was bad, I argued these studies are worthless because they look into insulin resistance with a MODERATE CARB HIGH FAT DIET, 2 energy sources that don&#39;t mix well. We need low carb diet studies that show similar results.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thats with a 47% carbohydrate diet. </p>

<p>Shes doing close to 0% carbohydrates. My understanding is that the insulin effect of protein in strongly dependent of amount of carbohydrates consumed (without carbs its close to zero). See Professor Bikmans take on it:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3fO5aTD6JU">Dr. Benjamin Bikman - &#39;Insulin vs. Glucagon: The relevance of dietary protein&#39;</a></p>

<p>also its possible to do a carnivore diet with a range of different protein:fat ratios. Not everyone is doing a high protein.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Ok then what aout this one?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15070924">Differential metabolic effects of saturated versus polyunsaturated fats in ketogenic diets.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ketogenic diets (KDs) are used for treatment of refractory epilepsy and metabolic disorders. The classic saturated fatty acid-enriched (SAT) KD has a fat:carbohydrate plus protein ratio of 4:1, in which the predominant fats are saturated. We hypothesized that a polyunsaturated fat-enriched (POLY) KD would induce a similar degree of ketosis with less detrimental effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Twenty healthy adults were randomized to two different weight-maintaining KDs for 5 d. Diets were 70% fat, 15% carbohydrate, and 15% protein. The fat contents were 60 or 15% saturated, 15 or 60% polyunsaturated, and 25% monounsaturated for SAT and POLY, respectively. Changes in serum beta-hydroxybutyrate, insulin sensitivity (S(I)), and lipid profiles were measured. Mean circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate levels increased 8.4 mg/dl in the POLY group (P = 0.0004), compared with 3.1 mg/dl in the SAT group (P = 0.07). <strong>S(I) increased significantly in the POLY group (P = 0.02)</strong>, whereas total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly in the SAT group (both P = 0.002). <strong>These data demonstrate that a short-term POLY KD induces a greater level of ketosis and improves S(I)</strong>, without adversely affecting total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared with a traditional SAT KD. Thus, a POLY KD may be superior to a classical SAT KD for chronic administration.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>70% fat, 15% carbohydrate, and 15% protein</p>

<p>This is STILL not a ketogenic diet, you seem to be misinformed of what a ketogenic diet truly is. </p>

<p>It needs to be less than 10% of your total carbs at 4:1, not 15. The whole &quot;keep it under 20 net carbs&quot; varies between people, but the rule of thumb is usually 10-5%, and the more restrictive the carb intake the greater the beneficial effects. </p>

<p>Not only that &quot;a <strong>short-term</strong> POLY KD induces a greater level of ketosis and improves S(I), without adversely affecting total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared with a traditional SAT KD.&quot;, short term means nothing for the majority of people who take this as a permanent life style change. It&#39;s also generally accepted that to become genuinely fat adapted, one needs about half a year.</p>

<p>Lets see how you spin it now.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>These level are definitively ketogenic level of BOHB. </p>

<p>I agree that 5 days is short. Do you have any other study that contradict this one with a longer duration? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It seems nobody really know how to measure if you are keto-adapted nor how long it takes. <a href="https://blog.virtahealth.com/keto-adapted/">Here</a>&#39;s an article by Phinney and Volek on virta health blog which can&#39;t seem to give a clear answer.</p>

                  'less pronounced after an overnight fast following a daylong '
                  'SFA diet (24±31%, p=0.04, n=10), and further attenuated 24h '

                  'A short-term SFA-enriched diet induced whole body insulin '

Postprandial responses were assessed following mixed-meal tests matched to compositions of the BD (control meal [CM]) and KD (ketogenic meal).\nRESULTS: Fasting ketones, glycerol, free fatty acids, glucagon, adiponectin, gastric inhibitory peptide, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and C-reactive protein were significantly increased on the KD. Fasting insulin, C-peptides, triglycerides, and fibroblast growth factor 21 were significantly decreased. During the KD, the glucose area under the curve was significantly higher with both test meals, and the insulin area under the curve was significantly higher only for the CM. Analyses of glucose homeostasis suggested that the KD insulin sensitivity decreased during the CM but increased during the ketogenic meal. Insulin-mediated antilipolysis was decreased on the KD regardless of meal type.\nCONCLUSIONS: Switching to the KD was associated with increased cholesterol and inflammatory markers, decreased triglycerides, and decreased insulin-mediated antilipolysis. Glucose homeostasis parameters were diet dependent and test meal dependent.","DOI":"10.1002/oby.22468","extra":"PMID: 31067015","libraryCatalog":"PubMed"}]

  'abstractNote': 'OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to measure '
                  'changes in glucose, lipid, and inflammation parameters '
                  'after transitioning from a baseline diet (BD) to an '
                  'isocaloric ketogenic diet (KD).\n'
                  'METHODS: Glucose homeostasis, lipid homeostasis, and '
                  'inflammation were studied in 17 men (BMI: 25-35\u2009kg/m2 '
                  ') during 4 weeks of a BD (15% protein, 50% carbohydrate, '
                  '35% fat) followed by 4 weeks of an isocaloric KD (15% '
                  'protein, 5% carbohydrate, 80% fat). Postprandial responses '
                  'were assessed following mixed-meal tests matched to '
                  'compositions of the BD (control meal [CM]) and KD '
                  '(ketogenic meal).\n'
                  'RESULTS: Fasting ketones, glycerol, free fatty acids, '
                  'glucagon, adiponectin, gastric inhibitory peptide, total '
                  'and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and C-reactive '
                  'protein were significantly increased on the KD. Fasting '
                  'insulin, C-peptides, triglycerides, and fibroblast growth '
                  'factor 21 were significantly decreased. During the KD, the '
                  'glucose area under the curve was significantly higher with '
                  'both test meals, and the insulin area under the curve was '
                  'significantly higher only for the CM. Analyses of glucose '
                  'homeostasis suggested that the KD insulin sensitivity '
                  'decreased during the CM but increased during the ketogenic '
                  'meal. Insulin-mediated antilipolysis was decreased on the '
                  'KD regardless of meal type.\n'

                  'increased cholesterol and inflammatory markers, decreased '
                  'triglycerides, and decreased insulin-mediated '

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Overall average consumption of sugar sweetened beverages has declined, but obesity and metabolic syndrome has not.  It seems that the simple average over a whole population isn&#39;t telling the most useful story. If 50% of the people drink 100% of the SSB and most of them get sick, the issue is still added refined sugars (mostly fructose fro HFCS).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213560/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213560/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Energy intake was significantly increased across SSB consumption in both men and women (<em>p</em> = 0.0038 and 0.0082, respectively). SSB consumption was positively associated with carbohydrate intake in men and women (<em>p</em> = 0.0021 and 0.0424, respectively) and with fat intake in men (<em>p</em>  = 0.0058). The percentage of energy from protein and fat significantly  increased across SSB consumption levels in men and women (all <em>p</em>  &lt; 0.0001), whereas the percentage of energy from carbohydrate was  negatively associated with SSB consumption in men and women (all <em>p</em> &lt; 0.0001)&quot;</p>

<p>Don&#39;t drink your calories, kids, you&#39;ll then consume more total.</p>

<p>&quot;The main findings of the present study indicate that SSB consumption is  closely linked to an increased risk of obesity in both men and women  after adjustment for potential confounders using data from  representative Korean adults. SSB consumption was positively associated  with the prevalence of MetS and its individual components including  abdominal obesity, reduced HDL-C, and elevated fasting glucose among the  Korean population.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a correlation, based on self-reported food questionaires, but then again so is the work showing an overall average decline.  It still seems like these drinks are driving diabesity and it&#39;s that the groups still drinking them, while fewer and thus driving down the overall average, are at higher risk of MetS.</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->
<div class="md"><p>The obesity and related health problems will only get worse until we educated people on the dangers of added sugar, and regulate it somehow. It will be a very long and difficult process, even harder than it was to finally convince people smoking is bad, which still hasn&#39;t stopped many people. The world&#39;s health is turning to crap and only getting worse, I&#39;m just so glad I took an interest in health and nutrition and now know better.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Dangers of overeating more so than added sugar. </p>

<p>But that will require people getting vitally interested in finding out what makes them overeat in the first place. Hint: it is not food composition.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I agree overeating is a huge aspect in our society but there’s added sugar in literally everything... I feel like this drives obesity and insulin resistance </p>

<p>At the end of the day calories are calories; overeating veggies vs overeating fast food everyday both lead to increase in weight gain, but if it’s veggies you’re getting a lot more nutrients and other things whereas fast food leads straight to excess weight gain with little to none nutritional benefits </p>

<p>Sugar itself is highly addictive, and there’s studies out there showing that cutting out sugar lowered many metabolic diseases and heart disease risks</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Iodine, an essential micronutrient, is required to produce thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) comprise a range of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, with the most significant irreversible effect resulting from neurodevelopmental deficits in fetal brain caused by deficient iodine status during early pregnancy. The objective of this scoping review was to summarize the studies that assessed iodine status of women of reproductive age in the USA. A systematic review of literature using the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) statement was conducted. PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, EBSCOHost, Cochrane, ERIC, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases were searched, 1652 records were identified. One thousand six hundred forty-one records that did not satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality review were excluded, and 11 peer-reviewed articles were determined to be eligible for this scoping review. Despite the USA being considered iodine sufficient for the general population, the US dietary iodine intakes have decreased drastically since the 1970s, with iodine deficiency reemerging in vulnerable groups such as women of reproductive age. Although data to conduct a scoping review of iodine status among women of reproductive age in the USA was scarce, majority of the articles reviewed demonstrate emergent iodine deficiency in this population of women of reproductive age, indicating alarm for a public health concern needing immediate attention.</p>

<p>Background: <strong>Arterial aging is well characterized in industrial populations, but scantly described in populations with little access to modern medicine.

<p>No conflicts were declared.</p>

<p>The discussion is quite long, but all relevant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We propose several possible hypotheses to explain the low atherosclerosis and CVD prevalence among Tsimane, and other traditional foraging and horticultural populations living under similar conditions. The combination of low LDL and high physical exertion is a common feature in many of these populations. The Tsimane diet contains wild game and fish, is low in saturated fat, and high in potassium (K). Plantains provide ∼1,500 mg K/day. Low BMI and LDL, and sparse tobacco consumption may be protective factors trumping the risk factors of atherosclerosis and CVD. Oxidized LDL is implicated in inflammatory cascades leading to endothelial dysfunction, plaque maturation and rupture; therefore some argue that atherosclerosis and CVD are avoidable when LDL is maintained &lt;70 mg/dL [15]. The Tsimane LDL profile is favorable though only 34% of Tsimane adults age 40+ have LDL below 70. Mean BP and ABI, however, do not differ among those above this LDL cutoff. With low HDL and moderate triglyceride levels, Tsimane have a healthy but “normal” mean total cholesterol to HDL ratio of 4.0 and an LDL to HDL ratio of 2.3 (for adults age 40+).</p>

<p>The physically demanding Tsimane lifestyle may be central for maintaining healthy metabolism and favorable body mass, blood lipids and cardiorespiratory health. Subsistence hunting, fishing and slash and burn farming require extensive daily physical activity, consistent with high VO2max values found using a variation of the Harvard Step Test on a subsample....These results are consistent with evidence for the cardioprotective value of exercise. Exercise reduces oxidative load in muscle, levels of inflammatory cytokines, SBP, macrophage-rich fat and improves insulin sensitivity [10]. Exercise associates with a favorable CVD risk profile independently of leanness [35]. Individuals with high cardio-fitness based on resting and maximal heart rate and VO2max show the lowest heart disease risk [36], [37]. </p>

<p>Several alternative explanations may also be responsible for the low CVD risk profile of Tsimane, and merit future investigation. Tsimane and other Amerindians should be comprehensively investigated for distinct inflammation profiles due to genetic variability in loci affecting expression of CRP [39], apolipoprotein-E [40], mannose-binding lectin (MBL) [41], NR4A nuclear receptor family [42], interleukine-6 (IL-6) [43], IL-1 [44], and toll-like receptor 4 [45]. These reflect the extent to which Tsimane exhibit pro- or anti-inflammatory preconditions. Amerindians also show distinct human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression at various MHC loci compared with other populations that show evidence of overdominant selection [46]. Although HLA-DR expression in macrophages and T-cells has been linked to plaque eruption and erosion [47], it is an open question whether allelic variation is of clinical significance. Other genetic contributions involve the processes by which inflammation and arterial damage result in acute coronary events. Plaque stability, disruption, erosion and thrombogenicity may be impacted by genes affecting interferon-α, collagen content and smooth muscle density in the fibrous cap [48], inflammatory infiltration of the cap, lipid composition of the atheromatous core and extracellular matrix (e.g. soft cholesterol esters vs. hard crystalline cholesterol), and both mechanical and hemodynamic forces that shear apart plaques. Genetic differences affecting metalloproteinase expression (e.g. collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins and matrilysin) may also be important, as these have been described as degrading all components of the extracellular matrix and can therefore also impact plaque disruption [49]. Genetics and diet (e.g. flavonol-rich citrus fruits) may also influence platelet aggregation, coagulation and fibrinolysis, which affects blood flow and thrombus formation at the site of disrupted plaques [50]. Genes affecting monocyte recruitment [e.g. CD14 receptor polymorphisms] [51], lipid transport [e.g., cholesteryl ester transport protein (CETP)] [52], lipid oxidation, and modulation of the inflammatory response to oxidized lipids may also help explain differences in susceptibility of populations to developing atherosclerosis [53].</p>

<p>One preliminary attempt to assess the implications of genetic differences between Tsimane and other populations is to consider atherosclerosis and CVD risk among Amerindians in the U.S. A study among 13 North Amerindian groups revealed a low rate of PAD (5.3%) among adults aged 45–74, little difference in PAD prevalence among the groups, and significant predictive effects of LDL, BMI, cigarette pack-years and fibrinogen [54]. Thus, while PAD is on the low end among North Amerindians, PAD is associated with the same risk factors as those in other populations. Most importantly, CRP levels among North Amerindians are higher than in other U.S. populations (median 3.2 mg/L even after removing the 16% who had CRP&gt;10 mg/L), and predict incident CVD [55]. Despite similar PAD rates and lower LDL levels than national averages, a longitudinal cohort study of CVD among North American Indians has shown that North Amerindians have higher rates of CVD than other U.S. populations, and that standard risk factors (e.g. hypertension, LDL, HDL, BMI) are predictive of CVD [56]. Their high rates of CRP and CVD are likely due to the high prevalence of diabetes, renal disease and obesity; hyperglycemia impedes endothelial function and produces glycation end products that support myocardial dysfunction [57].</p>

<p>Another unexplored potential explanation highlights the hypothesized cardioprotective effects of chronic helminthic infection. Polarized Th-2 immune activation associated with helminthic infection modifies cytokine profiles, whereby anti-inflammatory IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 protect vessel walls from oxidized LDL-induced monocyte injury in the endothelium, and downregulate fibrinogen synthesis [58]. Th-2 activation may also modulate responses to heat shock proteins, Chlamydia pneumonia, and cytomegalovirus, each of which has been tentatively linked to atherosclerosis [59]. Finally, helminthes may modulate host lipid metabolism, and may be responsible for lower blood cholesterol levels in parasitized humans [60]. Indeed, total and HDL cholesterol varied inversely with several infectious markers such as sedimentation rate, IgE and eosinophil count among Tsimane adults [61].</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Background—Conventional coronary artery disease risk factors might potentially explain at
least 90% of the attributable risk of coronary artery disease. To better understand the association
between the pre-industrial lifestyle and low prevalence of coronary artery disease risk factors, <strong>we
examined the Tsimane, a Bolivian population living a subsistence lifestyle of hunting, gathering,
fishing, and farming with few cardiovascular risk factors, but high infectious inflammatory burden.</strong></p>

<p>Methods—We did a cross-sectional cohort study including all individuals who self-identified as
Tsimane and who were aged 40 years or older. <strong>Coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by coronary
artery calcium (CAC) scoring done with non-contrast CT in Tsimane adults. We assessed the
difference between the Tsimane and 6814 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis (MESA). CAC scores higher than 100 were considered representative of
significant atherosclerotic disease.</strong> Tsimane blood lipid and inflammatory biomarkers were
obtained at the time of scanning, and in some patients, longitudinally.</p>

<p>Findings—Between July 2, 2014, and Sept 10, 2015, 705 individuals, who had data available for
analysis, were included in this study. <strong>596 (85%) of 705 Tsimane had no CAC, 89 (13%) had CAC
scores of 1–100, and 20 (3%) had CAC scores higher than 100. For individuals older than age 75
years, 31 (65%) Tsimane presented with a CAC score of 0, and only four (8%) had CAC scores of
100 or more, a five-fold lower prevalence than industrialised populations (p≤0-0001 for all age
categories of MESA). Mean LDL and HDL cholesterol concentrations were 2.35 mmol/L (91
mg/dL) and 1.0 mmol/L (39.5 mg/dL), respectively; obesity, hypertension, high blood sugar, and
regular cigarette smoking were rare. High- sensitivity C-reactive protein was elevated beyond the
clinical cutoff of 3.0 mg/dL in 360 (51%) Tsimane participants.</strong></p>

<p>Interpretation—<strong>Despite a high infectious inflammatory burden, the Tsimane, a forager-horticulturalist population of the Bolivian Amazon with few coronary artery disease risk factors,
have the lowest reported levels of coronary artery disease of any population recorded to date.
These findings suggest that coronary atherosclerosis can be avoided in most people by achieving a
lifetime with very low LDL, low blood pressure, low glucose, normal body-mass index, no
smoking, and plenty of physical activity. The relative contributions of each are still to be
determined.</strong></p>

<p>From the discussion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The pathophysiological mechanisms by which the Tsimane seem to be protected against
CAC development are unknown. <strong>Numerous potential explanations exist, and might relate to
coronary artery disease risk factors, subsistence lifestyle, genetics, and inflammation or
immune regulation. Tsimane have low total and LDL cholesterol.</strong> From 2004 to 2011, the
mean LDL cholesterol was 1.84 mmol/L (SD 0.57; appendix). Since 2011, average LDL
cholesterol has increased by 0.16 mmol/L per year and now averages 2.35 mmol/L. This
change is coincident with the availability of small gasoline motors that preclude the need for
manual canoeing or rafting for river travel to the market town, San Borja, where
non-subsistence food can be obtained. Whether the increasing LDL-cholesterol
concentrations coincide with increasing CAC will require assessment in future studies. <strong>This
low prevalence and extent of CAC exists in the presence of low HDL, a known coronary
artery disease risk factor. In the Tsimane, the average HDL was 1.0 mmol/L. This finding
might highlight a differential weight to LDL versus HDL cholesterol for CAC formation or,
alternatively, might be explained by ratios of total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol to HDL
cholesterol that place Tsimane individuals in a low-risk category when using US-based
classifications. Lower HDL cholesterol might also contribute to a higher likelihood of
infections and inflammation.</strong></p>

<p>The potentially atheroprotective effect of low LDL or LDL-to-HDL ratio might be partly
augmented by the Tsimane lifestyle. The Tsimane live a traditional forager-horticultural
lifestyle, in huts of thatched roofs, typically in villages of roughly 60-200 people (figure 5).
<strong>An estimated 14% of their average caloric diet is protein, 14% is fat, and 72% is
carbohydrate. Meat protein and fat are acquired by hunting with guns and bow and arrow,
or fresh water fishing with arrows, hook and line, or nets. Non-processed carbohydrates are
grown in the form of rice, plantain, manioc, and corn via slash-and-burn horticulture, and the
Tsimane also gather wild nuts and fruits. Importantly, carbohydrates are high in fibre and
very low in saturated fat and simple sugars, which might further explain our study findings.
The Tsimane diet lacks trans fats, and is a low fat diet, with an average estimated daily
consumption of 38 g fat, with 11 g saturated fat, 14 g monounsaturated fat, and 8 g
polyunsaturated fat. Most of a typical Tsimane day involves the physical activity of
farming, hunting, food preparation, household chores, and parenting. The average hunt lasts
more than 8 h and covers nearly 18 km, while horticultural labour includes using metal axes
to chop large areas of primary forest. Men and women spend a mean of 6–7 h and 4–6 h per
day engaging in physical activity, respectively. Less than 10% of Tsimane daylight hours
are spent engaged in sedentary activity, while more than 54% of waking hours are sedentary
in industrial populations. The Tsimane lack access to clean water, sewerage, or
electricity; over two- thirds of adults suffer from intestinal helminths at any given time.</strong>
The low prevalence of coronary artery disease in the Tsimane extends indirect evidence
found in other populations that an active subsistence lifestyle is atheroprotective.</p>

<p>Recently we have observed that patients infected with <em>G. lamblia</em> showed lower levels of lipid parameters (total cholesterol, HDLc and LDLc) as compared to control healthy group.  </p>

<p>The result showed significant lower levels of lipid profile [total cholesterol, HDL &amp; LDL] in <em>E. histolytica</em> and <em>E. dispar</em>  cyst passers and ALA patients as compared to healthy controls. Also, cyst passers had lower levels of cholesterol than ALA cases.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t really know conclusively how parasitic infection affects CVD risk - and it would be very difficult to find out given the significant differences between the populations who deal with infections and those who don&#39;t.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Others have found a slightly different macro ratio, describing it has carbohydrate (whole, high in fiber) and protein heavy but low fat.   They just can&#39;t get a lot of fat from the animals and fish they hunt so that makes sense.</p>

<p>&quot;The Tsimane diet was characterized by high energy (2422–2736 kcal/d), carbohydrate (376–423 g/d), and protein (119–139g/d) intakes; low fat intake (40–46 g/d); and low dietary diversityrelative to the average US diet. Most calories (64%) were derivedfrom complex carbohydrates. Total energy and carbohydrate intakeincreased significantly during the 5-y study, particularly in villagesnear market towns. Tsimane consumption of food additives (lard, oil,sugar, salt) increased significantly [sugar (15.8 g person−1d−1)andoil (4.9 mL  person−1d−1)] between 2010 and 2015. The more-acculturated Moseten consumed substantially more sugar (by 343%)and oil (by 535%) than the Tsimane.&quot;</p>

<p>Did you read the paper?  &quot;An estimated 14% of their average caloric diet is protein, 14% is fat, and 72% is carbohydrate.&quot;  That is not a meat-heavy diet.  Also: &quot;Men and women spend a mean of 6–7 h and 4–6 h per day engaging in physical activity, respectively. Less than 10% of Tsimane daylight hours are spent engaged in sedentary activity.&quot;  So their lifestyle is not very &#39;semi-sedentary.&#39;</p>

<p>Yes, did you read <strong><em>this</em></strong> paper? an estimation based on a 705 individuals compared to the totall 15.000/90+ villages </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Tsimane are a semi-sedentary population of ~15,000 forager-horticulturalists living in the Bolivian Amazon. They inhabit 90+ villages ranging in size from 50–500 individuals.</strong> They cultivate plantains, rice, corn, and sweet manioc in small swiddens, and regularly fish and hunt. Traditional foods comprise &gt;90% of the calories in the diet, with the remainder purchased from market stores, or obtained from trade with merchants (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5191915/#R70">Martin et al. 2012</a>). Tsimane live in extended family clusters, where the majority of food and labor sharing occurs. Mortality has been traditionally high, with approximately 20% of children dying before age 5 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5191915/#R46">Gurven et al. 2007</a>). The Tsimane rarely use modern contraceptives and total fertility rate is high (9.1 births per woman; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5191915/#R72">McAllister et al. 2012</a>). The population growth rate is also high at 3.6% per year. Mean (SD) age of first birth for men and women is 22.8 (4.2), and 18.6 (2.9) years, respectively (ibid). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5191915/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5191915/</a></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Please make sure to keep your comment respectful and avoid attacking the person.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>That is a study of the cognitive performance of 919 Tsimane and the authors provide no reference for their &#39;semi-sedentary&#39; claim, wheras the paper I linked takes its sourcing from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23383262/">this paper</a> which actually used accelerometers and heart-rate data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Accelerometry combined with heart rate monitoring was compared to the factorial method and used for nighttime sampling. Tsimane men and women display 24 hr physical activity level (PAL) of 2.02-2.15 and 1.73-1.85, respectively. Little time was spent &quot;sedentary&quot;, whereas most activity was light to moderate, rather than vigorous. Activity peaks by the late twenties in men, and declines thereafter, but remains constant among women after the early teens. Neither BMI, fat free mass or body fat percentage are associated with PAR. There was no negative effect of modernization on physical activity.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Again. their estimation is based only from that small sample of 705 individuals which is probably just <strong>one</strong> of those 90+ villages and is nowhere near the entire Tsimane population of 15.000-16.000 or even more people.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Agreed, but it&#39;s the best data we have.</p>

The updated 2013 Cochrane review has put to rest all lingering doubts about the overwhelming benefits of long-term statin therapy in primary prevention by conclusively demonstrating highly significant reductions in all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and the need for coronary artery revascularization procedures (CARPs).

2019-07-02 15:41:42,142 - __main__ - DEBUG - Submission Full Text: 
"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bz2puc/discussion_insulin_resistance_part_1_how_is/">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bzgm2z/discussion_insulin_resistance_part_1_what_is/">Part 2</a> first....</p>

<p>At the end of the last part, we had reached the point where we had talked about two things going on in insulin resistance:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A break in the glucose regulation system that causes the liver to continuously release glucose even when blood glucose is elevated and there is insulin in the blood.  </p></li>
<li><p>A decrease in the glucose-absorption ability of body cells, primarily of muscle and fat cells.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And what is causing that?</p>

<p>Well, the cause for the first seems to be excess fat accumulation in the liver, and that has been implicated in the second, though there is less research there. </p>

<p>This accumulation of excess fat in the liver is known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and has been known since the 1950s. NALFD may progress into more serious diseases in some cases. </p>

<p>There are different opinions on whether NAFLD is the cause of insulin resistance or vice versa. For our purposes, it&#39;s sufficient just to know that they are very highly correlated. </p>

<p>So, we have too much fat in the liver. How could it get there?</p>

<p>There are three sources of new fat in the human body:</p>

<ol>
<li>From fat that we eat</li>
<li>From fat created by the liver, either from glucose pulled from the bloodstream, or from the metabolism of other compounds, such as fructose, galactose, or ethanol.</li>
<li>From fat created by the fat cells from glucose.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is also likely that the amount of fat being burnt is important as accumulation not only requires new fat, it requires more fat coming in than going out.</p>

<p>Here is where we get to the contentious part; there are two main theories as to what is going on here. I&#39;ll attempt to explain them both, but I clearly have a dog in this race and welcome others to expand on the position that I don&#39;t hold.</p>

<p>The first theory is that it comes from dietary fat; that if you eat too much dietary fat, that fat is absorbed by the liver and the accumulation causes the insulin resistance and NAFLD.</p>

<p>The second theory is that it comes from fat that is created from carbohydrates. Fructose metabolism is a common villain in this theory. </p>

<p>How can we determine which of these theories is more likely to be correct?</p>

<p>I like to look and see what the mechanistic story is for each of the theories and see if it makes sense from that perspective, and also look at what studies can tell us.</p>

<p>AFAIK, the mechanistic story for the first theory is that more fat in the diet means more fat in circulation and therefore more fat absorbed by the liver. </p>

<p>Luckily, we already have a measure of fat in circulation; it&#39;s the triglycerides level. If a higher-fat diet results in higher triglyceride readings, that would be good support for this theory.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the evidence is exactly the opposite; there is robust evidence that lower-carb/higher-fat diets result in low triglyceride levels. If we look at Gardner&#39;s <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/205916">ATOZ study</a>, table 3 shows us that not only did the lower-carb (Atkins) diet lead to significantly lower fasted triglyceride levels, the biggest difference was early on when the carb levels were the lowest. This is a common feature in pretty much all of the truly low carb diets tested; they all reduce triglycerides more than the higher carb variants.</p>

<p>The other bit of evidence is the lack of clinical effectiveness of low-fat diets in treating type II diabetes. The majority of them produce increases in insulin sensitivity, but the improvements are small and the majority of the participants are still quite diabetic at the end of the study.</p>

<p>I leave it to others to advance more support for this theory. </p>

<p>WRT the second theory - that it&#39;s created fat that is the problem - I think the picture there is clearer.</p>

<p>We know that it&#39;s possible to accumulate a lot of fat in the liver purely through liver metabolism because that is what happens with alcoholic fatty liver disease. The metabolism of ethanol in the liver leads to excess energy in the liver, which leads to the creation of fatty acids and triglycerides, which accumulates. Both fructose and galactose are also metabolized only in the liver, and because they typically come with glucose, the liver will be in a high energy state when they are metabolized, which will push the liver to create fat from the extra energy (the only other destination for the extra energy would be as glucose, but extra glucose is not desirable when glucose is already common).</p>

<p>The liver fat could also come from the high blood triglycerides that are common for those with insulin resistance. Or if could be a combination effect; if the liver is creating a lot of new triglycerides when the blood triglycerides are high, perhaps that inhibits the release of triglycerides from the liver (I did not find any research on this but would  love to see some).</p>

<p>We would also expect that people in this state would have trouble losing weight because the hyperinsulinemia would inhibit fat burning, and that is also what we see. </p>

<p>If this theory were correct, what sort of diet would work well for insulin resistance and type II diabetes?</p>

<p>First, it would reduce both the amount of fat that is created by the liver and the amount of fat in circulation. </p>

<p>Second, it would somehow deal with the defect in gluconeogenesis so that blood glucose was normalized. </p>

<p>Third, it would deal with the hyperinsulinemia that is blocking fat burning so that the extra fat - both in the bloodstream and in the liver - could be burned.</p>

<p>I see one way to enable this mechanistically - through significant carbohydrate reduction.</p>

<p>It would certainly reduce the amount of fat created by the liver; not only would there be less fructose or galactose to metabolize, there would be less glucose to put the bloodstream into a high-glucose state where fructose and galactose would be metabolized to fat. </p>

<p>It would deal with the broken regulation of gluconeogenesis by putting the body into a state where gluconeogenesis was desirable, thereby making the broken regulation irrelevant. </p>

<p>It would deal with hyperinsulinemia by creating a metabolic condition where insulin was rarely necessary.</p>

<p>Is there clinical evidence for this?</p>

<p>I know of three approaches with studies that have credibly shown *reversal* of type II diabetes and insulin resistance. </p>

<ol>
<li>Gastric bypass</li>
<li>Very low calorie diets (600-800 calories per day)</li>
<li>Keto diets</li>
</ol>

<p>Gastric bypass is really a very low calorie diet, enforced by surgery. In the very low calorie cases, the body necessarily has much less carbohydrate than a normal calorie variant; the body is in a state of semi-starvation, and that&#39;s exactly when gluconeogenesis and fat burning both ramp up.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Any study of a ketogenic diet without calorie restriction that worked to improve insulin resistance? It&#39;s really bothersome that most ketogenic studies are confounded by weight loss.  A-to-Z study was also confounded by weight loss. It&#39;s true that ketogenic diet will tend to lower trig more than high-carb diet, but we still don&#39;t know how well an eucaloric ketogenic diet would do. Has it been tested? </p>

<p>As I said in that comment, without energy restriction, a ketogenic diet won&#39;t be able to address hepatic fat content. A eucaloric diet won&#39;t necessitate emptying of the liver as all the energy will be provided by the food, and an hypercaloric ketogenic diet will results in elevated trig which will have to be store somewhere, and that will in part be in the liver. </p>

<p>I’ve never heard of this first theory. Many people  do think that insulin resistance is caused by excess calories, from any source, leading to excess body fat- especially hormonally active visceral fat and intromyocellular lipids.

<p>I think you would need to address the finding that gastric bypass essentially reverses diabetes immediately after surgery.

<p>“Several intervention studies in diabetics and nondiabetics show fructose to markedly lower HbA1c (22–27)...</p>

<p>No evidence was uncovered via PubMed that &lt;100 g/d fructose in exchange for other carbohydrate would impair insulin sensitivity in humans. Indeed, consistent with a lowering of HbA1c (Fig. 1A), insulin sensitivity was improved (24) (Fig. 1 B). By contrast, an excessive intake (250 g/d) is reported to cause insulin resistance (28) (Fig. 2), and intermediate but still very high or excessive doses (&gt;100 g/d) can be without important effect (29,30). This provides weak evidence of possible dose dependency (Fig. 2) and strong reason to caution against extrapolating from excessive to moderate or high fructose intakes seen in the general population...</p>

<p>Meta-analysis of &gt;40 human intervention studies show &lt;100 g/d fructose is either without effect or may lower FPTG (Fig. 1 C) (10).

<p>I do think that triglyceride export from the liver is a factor, but I&#39;m skeptical - as I think Attia was - about it being useful as treatment.</p>

<p>The average insulin resistant person has significantly elevated triglycerides and is not effectively burning fat because of hyperinsulinemia. If you can improve the export of fat from the liver, it&#39;s going to either make the triglycerides worse or shift that fat burden to the fat cells. If that latter happens, that would be a better state, but one of the reasons the triglycerides are high is because the fat cells don&#39;t want that extra fat, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s obvious that the right thing happens.</p>

<p>One thing they have in common is a focus on insulin resistance at the skeletal muscle cell and at the adipocyte. Maybe the first place you started being confusing was with the focus on fatty liver. </p>

<p>You also said &quot;How can we determine which of these theories is more likely to be correct?&quot; which kind of implied that everyone knows these are the only two options, and that one of them simply has to be the correct, root cause of insulin resistance; when in reality it seems much, much more complicated than that coming from the actual scientists.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t including keto diets because unlike the other two they have not been shown to reverse insulin resistance. Although, if keto can reverse it, it&#39;s through weight loss, which still involves a calorie deficit when the diet is ad libitum.</p>

<p>Here is an interesting review, although it only has 50 citations, so I wouldn&#39;t put much stock in their novel proposed mechanism: <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11684-013-0262-6">Mechanisms of insulin resistance in obesity</a> (<a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1007/s11684-013-0262-6">full text</a>). It summarizes several other proposed mechanisms including inflammation, lipotoxicity, hyperinsulinemia, and mitochondrial dysfunction. It does seem likely that more than one of these are causal for insulin resistance, and I think there is also a place for the effects of dietary lipids and sugar (like <a href="/u/sanpaku">u/sanpaku</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/bzgm2z/discussion_insulin_resistance_part_1_what_is/eqsx2ch/?context=3">mentioned</a> yesterday). So I would say there are multiple important mechanisms if you consider that different causes act on different links in the chain of the biochemical pathway of insulin resistance.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yet in humans:</p>

<p><em>Saturated Fat Is More Metabolically Harmful for the Human Liver Than Unsaturated Fat or Simple Sugars.</em></p>

<p>“RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We overfed 38 overweight subjects (age 48 ± 2 years, BMI 31 ± 1 kg/m2, liver fat 4.7 ± 0.9%) 1,000 extra kcal/day of saturated (SAT) or unsaturated (UNSAT) fat or simple sugars (CARB) for 3 weeks. We measured IHTG (1H-MRS), pathways contributing to IHTG (lipolysis ([2H5]glycerol) and DNL (2H2O) basally and during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia), insulin resistance, endotoxemia, plasma ceramides, and adipose tissue gene expression at 0 and 3 weeks.</p>

<p>RESULTS: Overfeeding SAT increased IHTG more (+55%) than UNSAT (+15%, P &lt; 0.05). CARB increased IHTG (+33%) by stimulating DNL (+98%). SAT significantly increased while UNSAT decreased lipolysis. SAT induced insulin resistance and endotoxemia and significantly increased multiple plasma ceramides. The diets had distinct effects on adipose tissue gene expression.</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS: Macronutrient composition of excess energy influences pathways of IHTG: CARB increases DNL, while SAT increases and UNSAT decreases lipolysis. SAT induced the greatest increase in IHTG, insulin resistance, and harmful ceramides. Decreased intakes of SAT could be beneficial in reducing IHTG and the associated risk of diabetes.”</p>

<div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot we don&#39;t know yet but in the scenario I described, it looks like the incretin response plays a major role. There are all sorts of hypothesis and a variety of scenarios as to why the bypass works so quickly in reversing T2DM and they revolve around the glucoregulatory role of the gut. The fact that we see improved glucose responses prior to weight loss in patients after surgery indicates that it is not just a response to a low calorie diet.</p>

<p><a href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/39/6/893">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/39/6/893</a></p>

<p>I find the incretin based hypothesis interesting and plausible. By removing the upper portion of the small intestine you are introducing more nutrient rich food into lower parts of the GI tract. There are a greater density of nutrient sensing, incretin releasing cells further down the small intestine. Usually food would&#39;ve been absorbed further up the tract and not illicit as great of an incretin response. In certain surgeries that involve cutting out a portion of the upper small intestine, you now introduce a more nutritious slurry further down the GI tract. This interacts with the greater density of the incretin response cells and as a result, a greater incretin response. Some also propose that there is a dysfunction in incretin response that leads to insulin resistance and weight gain.</p>

<p>For a given diabetic at a given activity level, the muscles are going to burn a given amount of glucose. That is what defines how much glucose the muscles can absorb.

<p>I do think it could affect blood glucose levels in an OGTT, but those same muscles have been in an elevated glucose and insulin environment overnight and it may be that their glycogen stores are essentially full. </p>

<p>(I went looking for muscle glycogen storage information in diabetics but didn&#39;t find anything).</p>

<p>As for adipocytes, I think the mechanism there is more interesting, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very fruitful from a treatment perspective. We have an effective way of improving the uptake of glucose by adipocytes - injectable insulin does that well. </p>

<p>But when we give that to type II diabetics, they get fatter and not really any healthier. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t just true for diabetics. This is true for all of us. We can store glycogen until our stores are full. If they are full, do we become insulin resistant? </p>

<p>Anyone who eats slightly more carbs in a meal than they can immediately burn off plus use to top off glycogen now has &quot;extra&quot; glucose. So what do healthy people do with it? If I eat a high carb diet, with three meals a day, in at least one meal I&#39;m taking in enough energy for 8+ hours of functioning. Yet high carb diets don&#39;t cause insulin resistance - in fact isocalorically, highest carbs cause the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16620266/">greatest</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/52/3/524/4650824">muscle</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/19079907/">insulin</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/67/5/951/2651863">sensitivity</a>.</p>

<p>So where does the glucose go? Insulin stimulates Fatty Acid Synthase - don&#39;t people call it the &quot;fat storage hormone&quot;? Muscle cells take in glucose and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15039461/">synthesize</a> it into triglycerides, and store it for later. This isn&#39;t a problem if you are of normal weight and healthy. In fact athletes <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4762133/">have a lot</a> of IMC lipids which they use during exercise. &quot;Slow twitch&quot; muscle fibers burn them preferentially. When you do low-intensity exercise that burns fat, this is the fat you are burning.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re healthy, your muscle cells can remain insulin sensitive even when glycogen is full because they can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/0802861">convert</a> glucose to fat. They can also uptake triglycerides and store them directly. If your calorie intake is weight maintaining, your fat stores (adipose tissue and IMC lipids) don&#39;t grow, but within a day you are constantly oxidizing fat molecules and making new ones. When you&#39;re diabetic, you&#39;ve maxed out your IMC lipids (and not only that, they&#39;ve started producing <a href="https://journals.lww.com/co-clinicalnutrition/Abstract/2010/07000/Muscle_insulin_resistance__assault_by_lipids,.7.aspx">damaging byproducts</a>) and your adipocytes, so they must become insulin resistant and glucose and FFAs build up in the blood.</p>

<p>Also, insulin resistance might be the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3478531/">cause</a> of fatty liver for the same reason. Muscle DNL has a purpose, but liver DNL can only go into liver fat or triglycerides. </p>

<p>Obese people burn a ton of fat. If you are not losing or gaining weight, you are burning what you eat. If a person eats 40% fat, 45% carbs, 15% protein, they are burning both carbs and fat every day. What they need is to burn fat <em>on net</em> which is only possible via a calorie deficit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Why is saturated fat only worse, and substantially worse, when you overfeed? If sugar and unsaturated fats are so bad why are they better only when you over feed? </p>

<p>Do you have evidence that people are getting NAFLD on isocaloric diets?</p>

<div class="md"><p>&gt;  That argument was about whether the straw man theory you proposed as the only alternative to your pet theory was actually something scientists think. Since you were asserting that other people do hold this theory, the number of citations is relevant. </p>

<p>I&#39;m confused by this argument. You claimed that it&#39;s a straw man, I showed that people do claim that this is the mechanism. I think that pretty much shows that it&#39;s *not* a straw man. Now, there may in fact be other mechanisms that have more advocates. </p>

<p>WRT muscle energy storage, my point is that extent to which muscles can pull energy out of the system is directly correlated to how much energy they are expending. Whether the muscle tissues is insulin resistant or not does not change this. </p>

<p>&gt;&gt; But when we give that to type II diabetics, they get fatter and not really any healthier.</p>

<p>I agree that people who put on fat instead of getting insulin resistant are healthier than those with insulin resistance. But the studies who have attempted to tightly control blood glucose for people with insulin resistance have been disappointing from a health standpoint.</p>

<p>&gt; If a person eats 40% fat, 45% carbs, 15% protein, they are burning both carbs and fat every day. What they need is to burn fat <em>on net</em> which is only possible via a calorie deficit.</p>

<p>If that were the answer, then the myriad low-fat diets that have been tried for type II diabetes would generally be successful, but  that just isn&#39;t true. As I noted, the performance of the traditional diets is why type II diabetes is considered to be a chronic disease.</p>

<p>I agree that if you are burning more fat than you are adding, you are very likely in a calorie deficit. But I think the lack of success on most of those diets is an indication that diets that generate deficits aren&#39;t sufficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I had one more thought here...</p>

<p>Would you be willing to write up a post the explains what you think the cause of insulin resistance is? I think that would give me (and others) a clearer picture than the discussion chain that we have...</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>What relevance is there to 100% of the obese population <em>not eating 1000 EXTRA calories per day</em>? None whatsoever.</p>

<p>I have evidence that NAFLD can be reduced in an isocaloric diet in which refined sugars, particularly fructose is minimized [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5663253/">1</a>]. I have evidence that on an isocaloric HFLC or LFH(W)C diet NAFLD is reduced.</p>

<p>&quot;A small clinical trial of 18 patients used MRS to measure change in IHTG  following two weeks of either a calorie-restricted diet, or a  carbohydrate-restricted diet that was not calorie-restricted, and found  that patients in the carbohydrate-restricted arm exhibited a more  profound IHTG reduction, without any difference in overall weight loss,  compared to the calorie restricted arm [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679496/#R38">38**</a>].  A recent two-year multi-center trial that included over 300 patients  enrolled in a comprehensive lifestyle modification regimen observed  similar weight loss achieved by adherence to low-fat, versus  low-carbohydrate diets. The low-carbohydrate diet group exhibited  superior HDL cholesterol profiles [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679496/#R39">39**</a>].&quot;  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679496/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679496/</a></p>

<p>Your claim was that there were “two main theories”. The theory you were setting up as a main theory is clearly not. Yes, other mechanisms have more advocates, making them more “main”. </p>

<p>It’s not though. The total energy they pull and utilize over an entire day is dependent on expenditure. But muscles can store energy, so they can pull more postprandially if they are insulin sensitive. If you aren’t going to read my links I’ll stop citing papers. </p>

<p>Why does “treatment that cures diabetes” also have to be “magical treatment that makes it easy to lose weight”? Losing weight is seriously difficult. At the same time that excess energy is making you sick, other mechanisms in the body and brain are fighting back against any weight loss. It’s awful and deranged. </p>

<p>Low calorie diets work to reverse diabetes when the patients can stick to them (like in research studies). They are also incredibly difficult to stick to (in the real world). These things are not related. A diet that a patient can’t maintain is a failure, but not because it doesn’t “work”. Gastric bypass, like the other commenter mentioned, has an advantage because it actually <a href="http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2011/07/how-does-gastric-bypass-surgery-cause.html?m=1">lowers the set point</a>. So it seems to work the best of everything we know. </p>

<p>The idea that there must be one simple magical unified theory of everything for diabetes is a fallacy. There are thousands of biochemical pathways involved, some of them are doing what they’re supposed to but it’s become damaging, others have been disrupted by environmental factors.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll try to be clearer...</p>

<p>Generally speaking, muscles try to keep their glycogen stores full. If glucose is quite available - if you carb load - then you can stuff more glucose in. But once you reach that state, you can only pull in what you expend.</p>

<p>Or, to put it another way, muscles need to be in glucose balance.</p>

<p>Are you suggesting that muscles temporarily convert excess glucose to fat that is stored in muscles and then burned later? I didn&#39;t find any support for that in human studies...</p>

Recently, increased consumption of soybean oil, which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), has been proposed to play a causal role in the epidemic. Here, we designed a series of four isocaloric diets (HFD, SO-HFD, F-HFD, F-SO-HFD) to investigate the effects of saturated versus unsaturated fat, as well as fructose, on obesity and diabetes. C57/BL6 male mice fed a diet moderately high in fat from coconut oil and soybean oil (SO-HFD, 40% kcal total fat) showed statistically significant increases in weight gain, adiposity, diabetes, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance compared to mice on a diet consisting primarily of coconut oil (HFD). They also had fatty livers with hepatocyte ballooning and very large lipid droplets as well as shorter colonic crypt length. While the high fructose diet (F-HFD) did not cause as much obesity or diabetes as SO-HFD, it did cause rectal prolapse and a very fatty liver, but no balloon injury. The coconut oil diet (with or without fructose) increased spleen weight while fructose in the presence of soybean oil increased kidney weight. Metabolomics analysis of the liver showed an increased accumulation of PUFAs and their metabolites as well as γ-tocopherol, but a decrease in cholesterol in SO-HFD. Liver transcriptomics analysis revealed a global dysregulation of cytochrome P450 (Cyp) genes in SO-HFD versus HFD livers, most notably in the Cyp3a and Cyp2c families. Other genes involved in obesity (e.g., Cidec, Cd36), diabetes (Igfbp1), inflammation (Cd63), mitochondrial function (Pdk4) and cancer (H19) were also upregulated by the soybean oil diet.

GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) und GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) are the known incretin hormones from the upper (GIP, K cells) and lower (GLP-1, L cells) gut. Together, they are responsible for the incretin effect: a two- to three-fold higher insulin secretory response to oral as compared to intravenous glucose administration. In subjects with type 2 diabetes, this incretin effect is diminished or no longer present. This is the consequence of a substantially reduced effectiveness of GIP on the diabetic endocrine pancreas, and of the negligible physiological role of GLP-1 in mediating the incretin effect even in healthy subjects. However, the insulinotropic and glucagonostatic effects of GLP-1 are preserved in subjects with type 2 diabetes to the degree that pharmacological stimulation of GLP-1 receptors significantly reduces plasma glucose and improves glycaemic control. Thus, it has become a parent compound of incretin-based glucose-lowering medications (GLP-1 receptor agonists and inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 or DPP-4). GLP-1, in addition, has multiple effects on various organ systems. Most relevant are a reduction in appetite and food intake, leading to weight loss in the long term. Since GLP-1 secretion from the gut seems to be impaired in obese subjects, this may even indicate a role in the pathophysiology of obesity. Along these lines, an increased secretion of GLP-1 induced by delivering nutrients to lower parts of the small intestines (rich in L cells) may be one factor (among others like peptide YY) explaining weight loss and improvements in glycaemic control after bariatric surgery (e.g., Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). GIP and GLP-1, originally characterized as incretin hormones, have additional effects in adipose cells, bone, and the cardiovascular system. Especially, the latter have received attention based on recent findings that GLP-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide reduce cardiovascular events and prolong life in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes.

                  'RESULTS: On an isocaloric low-fat diet, Type 1 diabetic '
                  'patients significantly reduced the proportion of fat in the '
                  'total daily energy intake by 12.1% (or -3.6% of total '
                  'energy) as compared with a conventional diabetes diet (P = '
                  '0.039). The daily protein and carbohydrate intake increased '
                  '(+4.4% of total energy intake, P = 0.0049 and +2.5%, P = '
                  '0.34, respectively), while alcohol intake decreased (-3.2% '
                  'of total energy intake, P = 0.02). There was a significant '
                  'improvement in insulin sensitivity on the isocaloric, '
                  'low-fat diet compared with the standard diabetes diet [7.06 '
                  '+/- 2.16 mg/kg/min (mean +/- sd) vs. 5.52 +/- 2.35 '
                  'mg/kg/min (P = 0.03)]. However, insulin sensitivity '
                  'remained 33% lower than in the control subjects (P = '
                  '0.021). No significant changes occurred in body weight or '
                  'body composition. Glycated haemoglobin rose during both '
                  'diet intervention periods (P = 0.18), with no difference '
                  'between the two diets.\n'
                  'CONCLUSIONS: Change to an isocaloric, low-fat diet in Type '
                  '1 diabetic patients during a 3-month period resulted in '
                  'significant improvement in insulin sensitivity without '
                  'improvement in glycaemic control. However, insulin '

However, it is debated whether triglycerides or other lipid metabolites such as diacylglycerols and ceramides are directly responsible. These lipid metabolites can activate serine kinases that impair insulin signalling. Accumulation of acylcarnitines and reactive oxygen species could be additional causative agents of insulin resistance. Further, the precise defects in insulin signalling in muscle caused by high intramuscular lipid (i.e. lipotoxicity) remain unclear. In parallel, proinflammatory activation within the adipose tissue of obese and high-fat fed animals or humans causes muscle insulin resistance, and is ascribed to circulating inflammatory cytokines. Recent evidence also shows proinflammatory macrophages infiltrating muscle tissue and/or intermuscular adipose tissue, and there is growing evidence that fatty acids trigger macrophages to secrete factors that directly impair insulin actions.

  'abstractNote': 'Purpose of review\xa0The present review outlines possible '
                  'mechanisms by which high fatty acids, associated with '
                  'high-fat diet and obesity, impose insulin resistance on '
                  'glucose uptake into skeletal muscle.\n'
                  '        Recent findings\xa0It is well established that '
                  'muscle insulin resistance arises in conditions of '
                  'high-fatty acid availability, and correlates with '
                  'accumulation of triglycerides within skeletal muscle '
                  'fibres. However, it is debated whether triglycerides or '
                  'other lipid metabolites such as diacylglycerols and '
                  'ceramides are directly responsible. These lipid metabolites '
                  'can activate serine kinases that impair insulin signalling. '
                  'Accumulation of acylcarnitines and reactive oxygen species '
                  'could be additional causative agents of insulin resistance. '
                  'Further, the precise defects in insulin signalling in '
                  'muscle caused by high intramuscular lipid (i.e. '
                  'lipotoxicity) remain unclear. In parallel, proinflammatory '
                  'activation within the adipose tissue of obese and high-fat '
                  'fed animals or humans causes muscle insulin resistance, and '
                  'is ascribed to circulating inflammatory cytokines. Recent '
                  'evidence also shows proinflammatory macrophages '
                  'infiltrating muscle tissue and/or intermuscular adipose '
                  'tissue, and there is growing evidence that fatty acids '
                  'trigger macrophages to secrete factors that directly impair '
                  'insulin actions. These factors are postulated to activate '
                  'stress-signalling pathways in muscle that act on the same '
                  'insulin-signalling components affected by lipotoxicity.\n'
                  '        Summary\xa0Altered intramuscular lipid metabolism, '
                  'circulating cytokines, and inflammatory macrophage '

<p>I. Introduction</p>

<p>For the sake of clarity, the element iodine in all its forms will be identified in this manuscript with the letter I, whereas the name iodine will be reserved for the oxidized state I2. According to a recent editorial of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (1), one third of the world’s population lives in areas of I deficiency, which is the world’ leading cause of intellectual deficiency (2). I is an essential element and its essentiality is believed to be due to its requirement for the synthesis of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triodothyronine (T3). <strong>The recommended daily intake of I for adults of both sexes in North America and Western Europe varies from 150 to 300 ug (1).</strong> I deficiency results in goiter (enlarged thyroid gland) and hypothyroidism. The recommended levels for daily I intake were chosen with the goal of preventing and correcting endemic goiter and hypothyroidism, <strong>assuming</strong> that the only role of I in health maintenance is in its essentiality for the synthesis of T4 and T3.</p>

<p>Considering the importance of this element for overall wellbeing, it is most amazing that no study so far has attempted to answer the very important question: <strong>What is the optimal amount of daily I intake that will result in the greatest mental and physical levels of wellbeing in the majority of a population with a minimal degree of negative effects?</strong> In the studies designed to answer this question, consideration should be given to the possibility that I, at levels higher than those required to achieve normal thyroid function tests and absence of simple goiter, may have some very important thyroidal and extrathyroidal non T3-T4 related roles in overall wellbeing.</p>

<p>Some eighty years ago, D. Marine reported the results of his landmark study on the effect of I supplementation in the prevention and treatment of iodine-deficiency goiter. Based on extensive studies of goiter in farm animals, he estimated the amount of I that would be required for human subjects. He chose a population of adolescent school girls from the 5th to 12th grade between the ages of 10 and 18 years residing in Akron, Ohio, a city with a 56% incidence of goiter (3). His choice was based on the observation that the incidence of goiter was highest at puberty, and 6 times more common in girls than in boys (4). He studied two groups of pupils devoid of goiter (thyroid enlargement by palpation) at the beginning of the project. The control group consisted of 2305 pupils who did not receive I supplementation; and 2190 pupils received a total of 4 gm of sodium iodide per year for a period of 2 &amp;½ years. The amount of I was spread out in 2 doses of 2 gm each during the spring and during the fall. This 2 gm dose was administered in daily amounts of 0.2 gm of sodium iodide over 10 days. At 4000 mg of sodium iodide per 365 days, the daily amount is 12 mg, equivalent to 9 mg I. After 2 &amp;½ years of observation, 495 pupils in the control group developed thyroid enlargement (22%). Only 5 cases of goiter occurred in the I-supplementation group (0.2%). Iodism was observed in 0.5% of the pupils receiving I supplementation. In an area of Switzerland with an extremely high incidence of goiter (82 to 95%), Klinger, as reported by Marine (3), administered 10-15 mg of iodine weekly to 760 pupils of the same age group. The daily I intake in this group was 1.4-2 mg. The initial examination revealed 90% of them had enlarged thyroid. After 15 months of this program, only 28.3% of them still had an enlarged gland. <strong>None experienced iodism. In response to these studies, the Swiss Goiter Commission advised the use of I supplementation in all cantons. Iodized fat in tablet form containing 3 to 5 mg I per tablet was used for I supplementation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Due to the large consumption of seaweeds in the Japanese diet, this population ingests several milligrams of I daily without ill effects and in fact with some very good results evidenced by the very low incidence of fibrocystic disease of breast (5) and of the low mortality rates for cancers of the female reproductive organs (6).</strong> According to the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, the average daily intake of seaweed is 4.6 gm. At an average of 0.3% I content (range = 0.08-0.45%), <strong>that is an estimated daily I intake of 13.8 mg</strong> (7). Japanese living in the coastal areas consume more than 13.8 mg (7). Studies performed in some of the subjects living in the coastal areas, revealed that the thyroid glands exposed to those levels of I, organify more I than they secrete as T3 and T4 and the levels of T3 and T4 are maintained within a narrow range. The excess I is secreted as non hormonal I of unknown chemical composition, mostly as inorganic I (7). The intake of I in the non-coastal areas of Japan is less. A recent study of 2956 men and 1182 women residing in the non-coastal city of Sapporo, Japan (8), revealed a urine concentration of I in spot urine samples, with a mean value of 3.4 mg/L, corresponding to an estimated daily intake averaging 5.3 mg (5). This relatively low I intake by Japanese standard, is more than 30 times the recommended daily amount of I in North America and Europe (1).</p>

<p>B.V. Stadel, from the National Institute of Health, proposed in 1976 to test the hypothesis that the lower incidence and prevalence of breast dysfunctions and breast Ca; and the lower mortality rate from breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers observed in Japanese women living in Japan versus those women living in Hawaii and the continental US, was due their I intake (6). He suggested a prospective study with 2 groups of subjects recruited from the same population with a high incidence of the above pathologies: one control group on intakes of I from a Western diet at RDA levels, and the other intervention group, receiving I in amounts equivalent to that consumed by Japanese women living in Japan. So far, data from this type of prospective epidemiological research are not available in the published literature, regarding the incidence of cancer of the female reproductive organs in women receiving several mg of I daily as the only know variable, compared to women whose diet supplies RDA levels of I.</p>

<p>Data are available, however, regarding the effects of I, ingested in daily amounts of several mg on subjective and objective improvements of fibrocystic disease of the breast (FDB). In 1966, two Russian scientists (9) published their results regarding the effect of oral administration of potassium iodide in daily amounts equivalent to 10-20 mg I, on 200 patients with &quot;dyshormonal hyperphasia of mammary glands&quot;. They postulated that this form of mastopathy was due to excess estrogens from ovarian follicular cysts which were caused by insufficient consumption of I. The duration of I supplementation of their patients varied from 6 months to 3 years. Within 3 months, there was significant reduction of swelling, pain, diffuse induration and nodularity of the breast. Out of 167 patients who completed the program, a positive therapeutic effect was observed in 72% of them. In five patients with ovarian follicular cysts, there was a regression of the cystic ovaries following 5 months to one year of I supplementation. No side effects of I supplementation was reported in those patients.</p>

<p>Ghent et al (10) extended the Russian study further, using different amounts of different forms of I in women with FDB. Beginning in 1975, these Canadian investigators tested various amounts of various forms of I in three open trials. Lugol 5% solution was used in 233 patients for 2 years in daily amounts ranging from 31 to 62 mg I. They achieved clinical improvement in 70% of the patients. Thyroid function tests were affected in 4% of the patients and iodism was present in 3% of them. In 588 patients, using iodine caseinate at 10 mg/day for 5 years, only 40% success rate was achieved. In 1365 patients, using an aqueous saturated solution of iodine in daily amount based on body weight, estimated at 3-6 mg I/day, 74% of the patients had clinical improvements both subjectively from breast pain and objectively, form breast induration and nodularity. Iodism was present in only 0.1% in this last group. In a double blind study of 23 patients ingesting aqueous solution of iodine in amounts of 3 to 6 mg/day for a mean of 191 days, 65% showed objective and subjective improvement whereas in 33 patients on a placebo, 3% experienced worsening of objective signs and 35% experienced improvement in subjective breast pain. These data are summarized in Table I. Although the percent of subjects reporting side effects in Ghent’s studies appear high ranging from 7% to 10.9%, the authors stated that the incidence of iodism was relatively low and most complaints were minor such as increased breast pain at the onset of I supplementation, and complaint about the unpleasant taste of iodine.</p>

<p><strong>When the data from Marine’s, Klinger’s and Ghent’s studies (3,10) were evaluated regarding the incidence of iodism in relation to the daily amount of I ingested, a positive correlation was found between those 2 parameters: zero percent iodism at a daily amount of 1.4-2 mg; 0.1% iodism with 3-6 mg daily; 0.5% with 9 mg and 3% with 31-62 mg (Table II).</strong></p>

<div class="md"><p>We also has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/ay9p56/iodine_the_next_vitamin_d_part_i/">this previous discussion</a>.  I will repost my comment from there since it applies to the studies listed in this review:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would take any estimate of Japanese iodine intakes with a grain of salt (heh) unless they were measured with 24-hour urinary excretion.  24-hour food recalls and FFQs are way too unreliable due to the large variation in potential seaweed iodine levels (except <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27722921">this study</a> which actually measured seaweed levels and came to the same values as urine sample studies).  When you add it to other urine collection studies (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4696276/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5121429/">here</a>), we can see that the average excretion in Japan is 279-416 mcg/day.  Note there also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3976240/">risks</a> associated with excess iodine but the daily upper limit (in the US) is up at 1100 mcg (RDA 150 mcg for reasons described <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/10#273">here</a>), so there is a lot of room to play with intakes before reaching any concerning level (and even 1100 mcg appears safe for many people).</p>

<p>Personally, I shoot for 250 mcg per day but often get more than that.  I reach this value through food, iodized Lite Salt, and a kelp tablet every-so-often.  I haven&#39;t seen a single study linking increased risks with a daily intake of 250 mcg/day but would be interested in reading about that if anyone has any links.  From the literature, the 150 mcg RDA seems perhaps too low and I haven&#39;t seen any RCT support for going beyond 300 mcg.</p>

<p>Also note that if you are using seaweed for your major iodine source, ensure that the label actually lists an estimated iodine content so that you know exactly how much you are getting.  Seaweed levels can vary wildly and I wouldn&#39;t trust seaweeds as a reliable source without that information being listed.</p>

</div>
<div class="md"><p>So we should take more Iodine but taking it can also cause iodine poisoning?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a bit late to the party, but which form of Iodine would you recommend? Kelp, Potassium Iodid, Lugol, pure Iodine?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Continued</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 19th Edition of Remington’s Science and Practice of Pharmacy, published in 1995 (11), the recommended daily oral intake of Lugol 5% solution for I supplementation was between 0.1 and 0.3 ml. <strong>This time-tested Lugol solution has been available since 1829, when it was introduced by French physician Jean Lugol. The 5% Lugol solution contains 50 mg iodine and 100 mg potassium iodide per ml, with a total of 125 mg I/ml. The suggested daily amount of 0.1 ml is equivalent to 12.5 mg of I, with 5 mg iodine and 7.5 mg of iodide as the potassium salt. This amount of I is very close to 13.8 mg, the estimated daily intake of I in Japanese subjects living in Japan, based on seaweed consumption (7).</strong> Obviously, this quantity of I present in 4.6 gm of seaweed would have to be consumed daily to maintain the I intake at this level. As quoted by Ghent et al (10), in 1928 an autopsy series reported a 3% incidence of FDB, whereas in a 1973 autopsy report, the incidence of FDB increased markedly to 89% (10,12,13). Is it possible that the very low 3% incidence of FDB reported in the pre-RDA early 1900’s (12) was due to the widespread use of the Lugol solution available then from local apothecaries; and the recently reported 89% incidence of FDB (13) is due to a trend of decreasing I consumption (2) with such decreased levels still within RDA limits for I, therefore giving a false sense of I sufficiency?</p>

<p>This lengthy introduction could be justified in the present context by stating that this background information was necessary to set the stage for the present study.** If indeed, as suggested by Ghent et al, the amount of I required for breast normality is much higher than the RDA for I which is based on thyroid function tests and thyroid volume** (10), then the next question is: <strong>What is the optimal amount of I that will restore and maintain normal breast function and histology, without any significant side effects and negative impact on thyroid functions?</strong> From the studies referred to (9,10) and Table I, the range of daily I intake in the management of FDB was between 3 and 62 mg. From Table II, we observe that the incidence of iodism increased progressively from zero % at 2 mg to 3% at 31-62 mg.</p>

<p>Our goal was to assess the effect of a standardized fixed amount of I within the range of daily amount of I previously used in FDB, on blood chemistry, hematology, thyroid volume and function tests in clinically euthyroid women with normal thyroid volume by ultrasonometry; and subsequently trying the same in women with FDB if there was no evidence of toxicity and adverse effects on the thyroid gland. <strong>The equivalent of 0.1 ml of a 5% Lugol solution, that is 12.5 mg I was chosen, a value close to the average intake of 13.8 mg consumed in Japan</strong> (7), a country with a very low incidence of FDB (5); slightly higher than the 9 mg amount used in Marine’s original study (3) of adolescents, with a very low 0.5% incidence of iodism following this level of I supplementation; also within the range of the 10 to 20 mg amount used in the Russian study of FDB, without any side effects reported (8); and five times less than the largest amount of 62 mg used in Ghent’s studies with a 3% iodism reported (10).</p>

<p>Because administration of I in liquid solution is not very accurate, may stain clothing, has an unpleasant taste and causes gastric irritation, we decided to use a precisely quantified tablet form containing 5 mg iodine and 7.5 mg iodide as the potassium salt. To prevent gastric irritation, the iodine/iodide preparation was absorbed unto a colloidal silica excipient; and to eliminate the unpleasant taste of iodine, the tablets were coated with a thin film of pharmaceutical glaze. <strong>Ten clinically euthyroid caucasian women were evaluated before and 3 months after ingesting a tablet daily.</strong> The evaluation included thyroid function tests and assessments of thyroid volume by ultrasonometry. <strong>The results suggest that this form and amount of I administered daily for 3 months to euthyroid women had no detrimental effect on thyroid volume and functions</strong>. Some statistically significant changes were observed in the mean values of certain tests of urine analysis, thyroid function, hematology and blood chemistry following I supplementation. These mean values were within the reference range, except for mean platelet volume (MPV) with a mean value below the reference range prior to supplementation, but the mean MPV value increased to reach a level within the normal range following I supplementation. In 2 subjects, baseline TSH levels were above 5.6 mIU/L, the upper limit for the reference range of the clinical laboratory used in this study.
 In both subjects, I supplementation markedly suppressed TSH levels.</p>

<p>This papers links to a number of clinical trials going way beyond 300mcg, 1000-60000mcg and showing benefit with minor side effects. what are your thoughts on these?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note there also risks associated with excess iodine but the daily upper limit (in the US) is up at 1100 mcg (RDA 150 mcg for reasons described here),</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article argues that the RDA was set to correct endemic goiter but that there are other non goiter related benefits of iodine at higher levels. This is quite reminiscent of vitamin-d  where the RDA hav been (and sometimes still is) to low due to only looking at preventing rickets while we now know that there are other none rickets functions of vitamin-d that warrants a higher RDA. <a href="https://vitamindwiki.com/Vitamin+D+and+Iodine+are+similar%2C+and+both+are+deficient+and+important+to+health">article on vitamin-d iodine similarities</a></p>

<p>What are your thoughts on the argument for higher iodine for non-goiter purposes that the articles suggests? <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Optimum-Levels-of-Iodine-for-Greatest-Mental-and-Abraham-Flechas/8cd67f8962cc0c0a14cce0f2ff869c929b17a939/figure/1">Chart</a></p>

<p>I looked through the article you linked but cant find how they decided that 1100mcg is the tolerable upper limit, do you know how this was decided? The post article suggests that 1000-3000mcg should be close to risk free. And that thyroid risk starts around 150000mcg see

<p>The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has published probable safe upper limits for dietary intake of iodine (5). They range from 150 micrograms (mcg) per kilogram (kg) per day in newborn infants to 30mcg/kg/day in adults. That is 2 milligrams (2,000 micrograms) daily for a 146-pound adult. The safe upper limit is higher during pregnancy and lactation (40 mcg/kg/day).</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The iodine-cancer connection</p>

<p>The body requires iodine to metabolize both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. A substance called delta-iodolactone, a derivative of arachidonic acid, which is produced in the thyroid gland and breast tissue, prostate, colon, and the nervous system, is a regulator of a process called cellular apoptosis (&quot;cell death&quot;). Ascorbic acid is required to stimulate intracellular hydrogen peroxide synthesis that, in turn, provides the energy to make iodine free radicals necessary for this reaction. When the level of delta-iodolactone is high enough, the process of apoptosis can then kill cancer cells.(15)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for iodine - about 150 mcg per day - will not allow delta-iodolactone to be efficiently formed in the thyroid gland. The thyroid requires higher iodine concentrations to efficiently produce it. Researchers have found that 100 times the RDA amount of iodine is optimal to produce delta-iodolactone. That equates to taking about 15 mg of iodine per day (15,16). These findings are important because they imply that there are some biochemical reactions that require much larger amounts of iodine than the current RDA. The mechanism by which delta-iodolactone induces cell death may be an important pathway for curing some types of cancer.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>The established RDA allowance for iodine (150 mcg/day) is inadequate for many individuals. In order to maintain optimum health, adults need 2-5 mg of iodide daily. Actually, this is in line with the upper safe limit of dietary intake of iodine established by FAO (30 mcg/kg/day). In case of a dysfunctional thyroid or other illnesses, such as fibrocystic breast disease or cancer, 15-50 mg daily may be needed. Ask your doctor about the alternatives to hormone therapy or taking iodine-containing organic drugs, because inexpensive orthoiodosupplementation would usually not be his/her first choice.</p>

<p>The best and safest form of iodine supplementation for a healthy adult is iodide. Iodides are naturally produced in larger quantities by various seaweeds.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There is some evidence that suggests that. </p>

<p>its not uncommon for nutrients to have a potential for adverse effects if consumed in excess.  optimal amount is not necessarily the same for different people. </p>

<p>The risk with with iodine according to this data seems to start around 3-9 mg (0.1-0.5% risk). current RDA is 0.15-0.3mg. </p>

<p>It seems like there is therapeutic potential in the thyroid risk zone so higher might be warranted for some individuals but they should probably monitor their thyroid if they consume that much. Some claim that consuming extra selenium completely removes the risk for thyroid problems, i have not seen what data they have to justify this claim so cant comment on that.</p>

<p>This sections suggest that the risks might be lower than this data suggests. </p>

<p>The potentially adverse effects of I supplementation at the levels used in the present study are threefold: iodism, I-induced hyperthyroidism (IIH) and I-induced goiter (IIG). Iodism is dose-related, and the symptoms are unpleasant brassy taste, increased salivation, coryza, sneezing, and headache originating in the frontal sinuses. Skin lesions are mildly acneiform and distributed in the seborrheic areas.11,43 Those symptoms disappear spontaneously within a few days after stopping the administration of I. As of this writing, no iodism, and for that matter, no side effect has been reported in more than 150 subjects who underwent I supplementation at 12.5 mg/day. It was suggested 100 years ago that iodism may be due to small amounts of bromine contaminant in the iodine preparations and trace amount of iodate and iodic acid in the iodide solutions.43 With greater purity of USP grade materials now available, iodism may no longer be a problem at the level of I used in the present study.</p>

<p>This papers links to a number of clinical trials going way beyond 300mcg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they are randomized trials, could you point me directly towards a few of them?  The ones in the chart you posted are all related to fibrocystic breasts which are apparently common and not dangerous.  And did any of those studies measure TSH levels?  That&#39;s the first-line indicator for excessive iodine consumption.  &#39;Iodism&#39; shouldn&#39;t be our clinical endpoint, rather we should be shooting for an intake much lower than what will lead to any potential toxic symptoms, especially if the benefits are uncertain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I looked through the article you linked but cant find how they decided that 1100mcg is the tolerable upper limit, do you know how this was decided?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the relevant section:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Data Selection. The appropriate data for derivation of a UL for adults are those relating intake to thyroid dysfunction shown by elevated TSH concentrations. Studies conducted in countries with a history of inadequate iodine intake were not included in this review because of the altered response of TSH to iodine intake.</p>

<p>Identification of No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) and Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (LOAEL). Gardner and coworkers (1988) evaluated TSH concentrations in 30 adult men aged 22 to 40 years who received 500, 1,500, or 4,500 μg/day of supplemental iodide for 2 weeks. Baseline urinary iodine excretion was 287 μg/day; therefore baseline iodine intake from food is estimated to be approximately 300 μg/day. The mean basal serum TSH concentration increased significantly in those receiving the two higher doses, although it remained within the normal range. This study shows a LOAEL of 1,500 plus 300 μg/day, for a total of 1,800 μg/day.</p>

<p>In a similar study (Paul et al., 1988), nine men aged 26 to 56 years and 23 women aged 23 to 44 years received iodine supplements of 250, 500, or 1,500 μg/day for 14 days. Baseline urinary iodine excretion was 191 μg/day. Because greater than 90 percent of dietary iodine is excreted in urine (Nath et al., 1992), it was estimated that the baseline iodine intake was approximately 200 μg. Those receiving 1,500 μg/day of iodide showed a significant increase in baseline and TRH-stimulated serum TSH, effects not seen in the two lower doses. No subjects in this study had detectable antithyroid antibodies. The conclusion would be that an iodine intake of about 1,700 μg/ day increased TSH secretion. Both of the above studies support a LOAEL between 1,700 and 1,800 μg/day. Thus, the lowest LOAEL of 1,700 μg/day was selected.</p>

<p>Uncertainty Assessment. There is little uncertainty regarding the range of iodine intakes that are likely to induce elevated TSH concentration over baseline. A LOAEL of 1,700 μg/day and a NOAEL of 1,000 to 1,200 μg/day are estimated for adult humans. This results in an uncertainty factor (UF) of 1.5 to derive a NOAEL from a LOAEL. A higher uncertainty factor was not considered because of the mild, reversible nature of elevated TSH over baseline.</p>

<p>these CT:s show benefit at higher doses. What kind of evidence would you need to see to to think that the benefits are not uncertain?</p>

<hr/>

<p>If you check table 3-7 it shows a broad range of measurement for a 3 month N:10 12.5mg iodine intervention. The formatting for these tables where strange so couldn&#39;t easily post them to reddit. </p>

<p>Results</p>

<p>Clinically, there were significant improvements of mastodynia (p=0.004), tremor (p=0.048), and restless leg
(p=0.009) (Table 3). There was no statistically significant effect of I supplementation on blood pressure,
body temperature and body composition (Table 4).
Percent body fat reached a near significant drop
(p=0.075).
Regarding laboratory evaluation of the subjects, results
of urine analysis were normal in all subjects pre- and
post-I supplementation. The only statistically significant effect of I was on urine pH (p=0.012) with preand post-I values (mean ± SD) respectively of
6.05±0.69 and 7.00±0.85. (Reference Range: 5.0-8.5).
Out of 17 different measurements performed on blood
chemistry, nine were affected significantly by I supplementation: a drop in creatinine (p&lt;0.01), calcium
(p=0.04), albumin (p&lt;0.01), A/G ratio (p&lt;0.01), alkaline phosphatase (p&lt;0.01); and a rise in sodium </p>

<p>(p=0.01), carbon dioxide (p=0.02), globulin (p=0.01),
and SGPT levels (p&lt;0.01). However, all those values
remained well within the reference ranges for these
parameters (Table 5). Three hematological measurements out of the 13 assessed were significantly altered
by the intervention: a drop in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (p&lt;0.01) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) (p&lt;0.01); and a rise in mean platelet volume (MPV) (p=0.04). Although the above differences
were statistically significant, they represented a small
percentage of the mean values compared (Table 6).
The values for MCH and MCV were within the reference ranges both pre- and post-I supplementation.
However, the mean value for MPV (± SD) was below
the normal range of 8.2-10.3 ƒl prior to intervention
(7.5±1.3 ƒl) and increased to reach the normal range
following I supplementation (8.2±1.3 ƒl). Although
MPV below 4 ƒl is an indication of a compromised immune system, this slightly low mean value prior to I</p>

<p>supplementation may not be of clinical significance.
Nevertheless, the effect of I supplementation was beneficial on this parameter.
The data on thyroid function tests and thyroid volume
are displayed in Table 7. Thyroid volume in all the
subjects were below 18 ml, the upper limit of normal
values reported,14,15 suggesting that their intake of I
prior to this study was adequate to prevent enlargement
of the thyroid gland, and to maintain normal thyroid
hormones, since all these values were within normal
limits. Serum T4 levels dropped significantly (p&lt;0.01)
from a mean of 8.8 (SD=1.3) to 7.2 ug/dL (SD=1.1).
However, all individual values remained within the
reference range (Table 7). Mean serum TSH levels
decreased following I intake from 4.4 mIU/L to 3.2
mIU/L. This non-significant decrease was due to the
marked fall in subjects #1 and #10, with 16 mIU/L decrease between these two subjects. Using the classification of subclinical hypothyrodism as clinical euthyroidism with normal levels of thyroid hormones but
elevated TSH above 6 mIU/L,20-22 subjects #1 and #10
would be classified as subclinical hypothyroid before I
supplementation.</p>

<p>I mean, it was an n=10 study with no control group and the authors of the paper promoting these results are selling an iodine supplement.  I would be interested in <em>much</em> more rigorous trials before recommending an iodine intake that is above the daily upper limit of the major governing bodies.</p>

Another set of three patterns, “Cluster I (Rice and vegetables)” (n = 22), “Cluster II (Fish and Japanese noodles)” (n = 33), and “Cluster III (Bread and non-Japanese noodles)” (n = 140), was found in female subjects. Although the habitual iodine intake of almost all participants was above the estimated average requirement (EAR), iodine intake was statistically significantly lowest in Cluster II in men and Cluster III in women. Moreover, the mean participant age was the youngest in these clusters.\n\nConclusion\nAlthough Japan is known as a high iodine-consuming country, some Japanese individuals who do not eat a traditional Japanese-style diet consume low amounts of iodine.
